Security Council on Monday to support the three-phase plan announced by President Joe Biden aimed at ending the nearly eight-month war in Gaza, freeing all hostages and sending massive aid into the devastated territory.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 14 other council members to back the proposal for ending the conflict that began with Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe brief draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would welcome the May 31 deal announced by President Biden and call on Hamas \"to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\" Hamas has said it views the proposal \"positively.\"\n\nIt makes no mention of Israeli acceptance of the deal.\n\nWhen President Biden made the announcement, he called it an Israeli offer that includes an \"enduring cease-fire\" and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages it is holding.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his hardline governing partners Monday the proposal announced by President Biden would meet Israel's goal of destroying Hamas, according to local media. The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn't eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu told parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that President Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there are \"gaps.\"\n\nPresident Biden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nIsrael at War\n\nIsrael declares 4 more hostages are dead in Gaza, including 3 older men AP via Scripps News 5:29 PM, Jun 03, 2024\n\nAmerican hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza.\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. President Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on Oct. 7, then more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by President Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nThe draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, \"with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation.\"\n\nThe draft would also reiterate the council's \"unwavering commitment\" to a two-state solution, and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said Security Council members \"have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"\n\n\"Council members should not let this opportunity pass by,\" she said. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations -- Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt -- urged Israel and Hamas to consider President Biden's proposal \"seriously and positively.\"\n\nThe group of seven major industrialized nations -- the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy -- also backed the cease-fire plan.", "source": {"uri": "wptv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Security Council on Monday to support the three-phase plan announced by President Joe Biden aimed at ending the nearly eight-month war in Gaza, freeing all hostages and sending massive aid into the devastated territory.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 14 other council members to back the proposal for ending the conflict that began with Hamas\u00b4 surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe brief draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would welcome the May 31 deal announced by Biden and call on Hamas \"to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\" Hamas has said it views the proposal \"positively.\"\n\nIt makes no mention of Israeli acceptance of the deal.\n\nWhen Biden made the announcement he called it an Israeli offer that includes an \"enduring cease-fire\" and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages it is holding.\n\nPeople speak during a Security Council meeting about the war in Gaza at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, May 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his hardline governing partners Monday the proposal announced by Biden would meet Israel\u00b4s goal of destroying Hamas, according to local media. The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn\u00b4t eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu told parliament\u00b4s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there are \"gaps.\"\n\nBiden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAmerican hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza.\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on Oct. 7, then more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u00b4s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nThe draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, \"with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation.\"\n\nThe draft would also reiterate the council\u00b4s \"unwavering commitment\" to a two-state solution, and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said Security Council members \"have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"\n\n\"Council members should not let this opportunity pass by,\" she said. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations - Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt - urged Israel and Hamas to consider Biden\u00b4s proposal \"seriously and positively.\"\n\nThe group of seven major industrialized nations - the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy - also backed the cease-fire plan.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

Security Council on Monday to support the three-phase plan announced by President Joe Biden aimed at ending the nearly eight-month war in Gaza, freeing all hostages and sending massive aid into the devastated territory.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 14 other council members to back the proposal for ending the conflict that began with Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe brief draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would welcome the May 31 deal announced by Biden and call on Hamas \"to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\" Hamas has said it views the proposal \"positively.\"\n\nIt makes no mention of Israeli acceptance of the deal.\n\nWhen Biden made the announcement he called it an Israeli offer that includes an \"enduring cease-fire\" and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages it is holding.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his hardline governing partners Monday the proposal announced by Biden would meet Israel's goal of destroying Hamas, according to local media. The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn't eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu told parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there are \"gaps.\"\n\nBiden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAmerican hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza.\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on Oct. 7, then more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nThe draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, \"with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation.\"\n\nThe draft would also reiterate the council's \"unwavering commitment\" to a two-state solution, and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said Security Council members \"have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"\n\n\"Council members should not let this opportunity pass by,\" she said. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations -- Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt -- urged Israel and Hamas to consider Biden's proposal \"seriously and positively.\"\n\nThe group of seven major industrialized nations -- the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy -- also backed the cease-fire plan.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

AFP\n\nA few months before its presidential elections, the US is embarked on a multi-pronged campaign to win acceptance of President Joe Biden's proposal for a Gaza truce deal, which is based a three-phase Israeli blueprint for a ceasefire in the enclave in return for the release of Israeli hostages.\n\nDoubts remain as the Israeli government is divided over the proposal. Hamas has not yet given its final response while the US is pressing Doha and Cairo to ensure the militant group's endorsement. Hamas has only said it viewed the proposal \"positively.\"\n\nOn Monday, the US pressed the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution backing the proposal.\n\nIt circulated a one-page draft text to the 15-member council.\n\nThe draft calls on Hamas to accept the deal and \"fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\"\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,\" US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the fighting showed no sign of easing, with the war that has devastated the coastal territory of 2.4 million people soon to enter its ninth month.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military said its forces had struck \"over 50 targets\" in the past day, while Gaza hospitals reported at least 19 fatalities in overnight strikes.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told his hardline governing partners Monday the proposal announced by Biden would meet Israel's goal of destroying Hamas, according to local media.\n\nThe more extremist members of his cabinet have threatened to bring down the government if Netanyahu agreed to a deal that did not eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu also told parliament on Monday that Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there were \"gaps.\"\n\nThe leaked quotes from a closed-door parliamentary meeting, which were not immediately confirmed by officials, suggested Israel sees a possibility of entering an initial Gaza truce though it has ruled out ending the war as demanded by Hamas.\n\nBiden had said on May 31 that the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete ceasefire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAmerican hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families.

Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary ceasefire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies said in a statement that they \"fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive\" ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 statement said.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt also said on Monday it was important to \"deal seriously and positively\" with a proposal presented by US President Joe Biden that would lead to a ceasefire in Gaza, Saudi state news agency (SPA) reported.\n\nThe foreign ministers met virtually to discuss the proposal alongside US-Qatari-Egyptian mediating efforts for an Israeli hostages-Palestinian prisoners swap deal that would lead to a

Security Council on Monday to support the three-phase plan announced by President Joe Biden aimed at ending the nearly eight-month war in Gaza, freeing all hostages and sending massive aid into the devastated territory.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 14 other council members to back the proposal for ending the conflict that began with Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe brief draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would welcome the May 31 deal announced by Biden and call on Hamas \"to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\" Hamas has said it views the proposal \"positively.\"\n\nIt makes no mention of Israeli acceptance of the deal.\n\nWhen Biden made the announcement he called it an Israeli offer that includes an \"enduring cease-fire\" and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages it is holding.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his hardline governing partners Monday the proposal announced by Biden would meet Israel's goal of destroying Hamas, according to local media. The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn't eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu told parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there are \"gaps.\"\n\nBiden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAmerican hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on Oct. 7, then more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nThe draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, \"with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation.\"\n\nThe draft would also reiterate the council's \"unwavering commitment\" to a two-state solution, and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said Security Council members \"have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"\n\n\"Council members should not let this opportunity pass by,\" she said. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations -- Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt -- urged Israel and Hamas to consider Biden's proposal \"seriously and positively.\"\n\nThe group of seven major industrialized nations -- the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy -- also backed the cease-fire plan.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "edith_m_lederer@gazette.com", "name": "Edith M.

The move was a departure from the U.S. administration's position throughout the conflict, which was to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves regarding hostage negotiations.\n\nThe president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to release the hostages, it was time to take a different approach and make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome, said White House national security spokesman John Kirby.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal that includes a ceasefire and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he would continue its war until 'until Hamas is destroyed.\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition single-mindedly committed to eradicating Hamas. He sowed more doubts about the viability of the proposal on Monday when he told an Israeli parliamentary committee that there were some flaws in the way Biden presented the proposal. The prime minister said the Israelis reserved the right to return to war.\n\nKirby downplayed the differences between Biden and Netanyahu and stressed that the proposal was Israeli. He added that Biden agrees with the Israelis that Hamas should not rule Gaza after the war, nor does he expect Israel to have to live alongside that kind of terrorist threat. \"\n\nIt wasn't about blocking the prime minister or the war cabinet, Kirby said. It was about showing the public with what quality, with what fidelity and with what confidence the Israelis had presented a new proposal. This shows how much they really want this to happen. \"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to the terms, it would force Netanyahu to make difficult political calculations. Two leaders of his far-right coalition, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs the proposal. This would lead to the collapse of the coalition.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a ceasefire would amount to humiliation of Israel and capitulation. According to him, increased military pressure is the only language understood in the Middle East.\n\nBiden expressed concern last week that members of the Israeli government want to continue fighting for years and do not view the release of hostages as a \"priority.\" Administration officials warned Israeli officials on Monday that getting bogged down in Gaza could be detrimental to Israel's national security.\n\nEndless conflict in Gaza in pursuit of an idea of total victory will not make Israel more secure,\" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.\n\nNetanyahu also faced pressure from the hostages' families. Officials say about 80 people captured by militants in the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others to reach a deal to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, pledged over the weekend to provide a political safety net for Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nAlthough the proposal faces significant challenges, the Biden administration has said it is cautiously optimistic that a deal can be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to get behind the proposal.\n\nThey need to pay attention to Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to make this deal, Sullivan said during an appearance at the US Global Leadership Coalition conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden spoke Monday with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said this was the best possible opportunity for a deal, the White House said.\n\nAmbassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, said the United States had circulated a draft resolution seeking support for the proposal from the other 14 members of the U.N. Security Council .\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey's use of its influence with Hamas to get it to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nOn Monday, Group of Seven leaders also approved the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this agreement, that Israel is ready to move forward, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a press release.\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that it would be difficult to move past the first phase of the proposal.\n\nThe first phase would last six weeks and include a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded. , in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining hostages, including male soldiers, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make huge demands on which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to guarantee that it will not continue targeting Hamas' top leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, said that even moving to the first phase and the six-week pause in fighting would lead to a slowdown in the escalation of the military campaign and a decrease in the number of deaths.\n\nI'm not sure they can expect much more, said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Ultimately, negotiations only work if the parties feel enough pain accompanied by the prospect of gain, which generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration. \"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials are considering the conflict over a much longer period.\n\nLast week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and government capabilities of Hamas and the smaller group Islamic Jihad activist.\n\nBut with U.S. Election Day just over five months away, Biden faces growing pressure to more quickly resolve the Middle East conflict that is causing him to lose support.\n\nAP writers Edith M.

Now he is seeking international backing for it.\n\nWashington urged the UN Security Council on Monday to support a ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, which would free all hostages and send massive amounts of aid into Gaza.\n\nThe three-part proposal aimed at ending the nearly eight-month war was announced by US President Joe Biden on 31 May. Now he is trying to drum up support at the international organisation.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,\" said US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield in a statement.\n\nBiden has called on Hamas to accept the deal \"fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\" The Palestinian militant group has said it views the proposal \"positively.\"\n\nThe draft resolution shown to the UN Security Council makes no mention of Israeli acceptance of the deal.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his hardline governing partners on Monday the proposal would still allow Israel to meet the goal of destroying Hamas, according to local media.\n\nUltranationalists have threatened to topple his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn't eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu has not outlined all the details of the ceasefire proposal, but said on Monday there were \"gaps\".\n\nBiden said the first phase of the plan would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete ceasefire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the freeing of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nUS hostages would be released at this stage, with the remains of hostages who have been killed returned to their families also. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza.\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nBiden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary ceasefire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by the US leader calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nThe war has damaged or destroyed approximately 62 percent of all homes in the Palestinian enclave, leaving more than a million people without homes, according to estimates by the World Bank and UN.\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were take hostage in Hamas' surprise 7 October attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people.\n\nMore than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Mr Netanyahu agrees to a deal that does not eliminate Hamas.\n\nMr Netanyahu told parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee on Monday that Mr Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details and he said there are \"gaps\".\n\nThe US president said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete ceasefire\", a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages - including women, the elderly and the wounded - in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAmerican hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza.\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nMr Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary ceasefire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently\".\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on October 7th with more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by Mr Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nThe draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, \"with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation.\"\n\nThe draft would also reiterate the council's \"unwavering commitment\" to a two-state solution and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe US ambassador said security council members \"have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza\".\n\n\"Council members should not let this opportunity pass by,\" she said. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations - Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt - urged Israel and Hamas to consider Mr Biden's proposal \"seriously and positively.\"\n\nThe group of seven major industrialised nations - the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy - also backed the ceasefire plan. - AP", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The move diverged from the U.S. administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal -- which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nBiden last week expressed concern about those in the Israeli government who \"want to keep fighting for years\" and don't see freeing the hostages as a \"priority.\" Administration officials on Monday warned Israeli officials that getting bogged down in Gaza could be detrimental to Israel's national security.\n\n\"Endless conflict in Gaza in pursuit of some idea of total victory is not going to make Israel safer,\" said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nAmbassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, said the U.S. circulated a draft resolution seeking support for the proposal from the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one -- and the six-week pause in fighting -- would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.\n\n--\n\nAP writers Edith M.

But Hamas has yet to agree to it, and Netanyahu has since been reserved in his comments about it. Days before, Time magazine asked Biden in an interview whether he believed Netanyahu was dragging out the war for political self-preservation.\n\n\"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" Biden replied in the interview, which was published Tuesday.\n\nBiden acknowledged that he and Netanyahu have had tense relations as the death toll in Gaza has soared past the 36,000 mark, a figure that includes civilians and combatants. They are particularly at odds over whether a revitalized Palestinian Authority should govern Gaza after the war, which the United States favors and Netanyahu rejects without offering a detailed plan of his own.\n\n\"My major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after ... Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" Biden asked rhetorically.\n\n\"The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work,\" he said.\n\nThis image contains sensitive content which some people may find offensive or disturbing.Click to reveal\n\nThe fate of a proposal to halt fighting in Gaza for six weeks and increase humanitarian aid while Hamas releases some hostages it is holding in exchange for Palestinians jailed in Israel remained uncertain Tuesday. Hamas has yet to respond to the proposal, Israeli officials are questioning some of the details and the United States is seeking U.N. Security Council support for the deal's acceptance and implementation.\n\nA draft U.S. resolution seen by VOA calls on Hamas to fully accept and implement the cease-fire proposal \"without delay and without condition.\"\n\nThe draft says, \"Swift implementation of this deal would enable a cease-fire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas in Gaza, the release of hostages, a surge in humanitarian assistance, restoration of basic services, and the return of Palestinian civilians to northern Gaza.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday that Hamas, which received the cease-fire proposal Thursday, had yet to respond. He said the key elements of the proposal \"are nearly identical to the major elements of the proposal that Hamas submitted several weeks ago.\"\n\nThe basic outline of the deal includes a six-week halt in fighting, the release of some hostages from Gaza, daily deliveries of 600 trucks of aid for Palestinians and further negotiations aimed at securing a permanent end to the conflict.\n\nU.S. officials reiterated Monday that the cease-fire proposal, although presented publicly by Biden last week, is an Israeli proposal.\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that making public negotiations that officials have declined to reveal in the past for fear of disrupting the negotiation process was not about putting pressure on Israeli officials, but rather, if anything, publicly pressuring Hamas and its leaders to accept the deal.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here, catalyze a different outcome,\" Kirby said.\n\nSmoke plumes billow near tents sheltering displaced Palestinians in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on June 4, 2024.\n\nKirby said in earlier comments to reporters that if Hamas were to accept the proposal, Israel would as well.\n\nNetanyahu told a parliamentary committee Monday that \"claims that we have agreed to a cease-fire without our conditions being met are incorrect,\" according to a statement from his office.\n\nIsrael said, \"The war will be stopped for the purpose of returning the hostages\" after which discussions would follow on how to achieve Israel's goal of eliminating Hamas.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations issued a joint statement Monday fully endorsing the cease-fire proposal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the statement said.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates said after a virtual meeting Monday that they support efforts to negotiate a permanent cease-fire, while emphasizing \"dealing seriously and positively\" with the proposal outlined by Biden.\n\nThe ministers called for Israel's full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the return of displaced Palestinians to areas they fled, the launch of reconstruction efforts in Gaza, and the implementation of a two-state solution, according to a statement released by Jordan's foreign ministry.\n\nHamas launched a terror attack October 7 on Israel, killing about 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies, and taking roughly 250 hostages. About 120 of the hostages remain in Gaza, although the Israeli military says 37 of them are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardments and ground offensive have killed at least 36,400 people in Gaza,

The move diverged from the U.S. administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal -- which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNETANYAHU FACING PRESSURE FROM FAR-RIGHT\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nBiden last week expressed concern about those in the Israeli government who \"want to keep fighting for years\" and don't see freeing the hostages as a \"priority.\" Administration officials on Monday warned Israeli officials that getting bogged down in Gaza could be detrimental to Israel's national security.\n\n\"Endless conflict in Gaza in pursuit of some idea of total victory is not going to make Israel safer,\" said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nOPTIMISM DESPITE HEADWINDS\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nAmbassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, said the U.S. circulated a draft resolution seeking support for the proposal from the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nEVEN GETTING TO PHASE ONE IS A CHALLENGE\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one -- and the six-week pause in fighting -- would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.\n\n--\n\nAP writers Edith M.

The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one -- and the six-week pause in fighting -- would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.\n\n--\n\nAP writers Edith M.

The move diverged from the US administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal - which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition - National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages - officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others - to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the US Global Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nAmbassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy to the United Nations, said the US circulated a draft resolution seeking support for the proposal from the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one - and the six-week pause in fighting - would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency.

The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn't \"eliminate\" Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu told parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there are \"gaps.\"\n\nBiden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAmerican captives would be released at this stage, and the remains of hostages who had been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks entering Gaza daily.\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living captives would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on Oct. 7, then more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 captives are believed to still in Gaza, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, most of them women and children.\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the Israeli war.\n\nThe draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, \"with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation.\"\n\nThe draft would also reiterate the council's \"unwavering commitment\" to a two-state solution, and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said Security Council members \"have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"\n\n\"Council members should not let this opportunity pass by,\" she said. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations -- Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt -- urged Israel and Hamas to consider Biden's proposal \"seriously and positively.\"\n\nThe group of seven major industrialised nations -- the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy -- also backed the cease-fire plan.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645"}, "authors": [],

The move diverged from the U.S. administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal - which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivers remarks on the verdict in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial and on the Middle East, from the State Dining Room of the White House, Friday, May 31, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition - National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - have threatened to leave Netanyahu\u00b4s government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages - officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others - to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it\u00b4s time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the U.S. Global Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one - and the six-week pause in fighting - would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I\u00b4m not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that\u00b4s left him bleeding support.\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivers remarks on the verdict in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial and on the Middle East, from the State Dining Room of the White House, Friday, May 31, 2024, in Washington.

Security Council on Monday to support the three-phase plan announced by President Joe Biden aimed at ending the nearly eight-month war in Gaza, freeing all hostages and sending massive aid into the devastated territory.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 14 other council members to back the proposal for ending the conflict that began with Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed some 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn't eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu told parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there are \"gaps.\"\n\nBiden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAmerican hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza.\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on Oct. 7, then more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, \"with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation.\"\n\nThe draft would also reiterate the council's \"unwavering commitment\" to a two-state solution, and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said Security Council members \"have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"\n\n\"Council members should not let this opportunity pass by,\" she said. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations -- Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt -- urged Israel and Hamas to consider Biden's proposal \"seriously and positively.\"\n\nThe group of seven major industrialized

The move diverged from the U.S. administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal -- which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNETANYAHU FACING PRESSURE FROM FAR-RIGHT\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nOPTIMISM DESPITE HEADWINDS\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the U.S. Global Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nEVEN GETTING TO PHASE ONE IS A CHALLENGE\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one -- and the six-week pause in fighting -- would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Around 80 hostages captured on Oct. 7 are believed to still be alive in Gaza, alongside the remains of 43 others.\n\nMonday's announcement came days after U.S. President Joe Biden announced that Israel has offered Hamas a deal to release all the hostages in Gaza and potentially end the war. Biden says the militant group is sufficiently depleted, however Israeli leaders say destroying Hamas will require more military operations in Gaza, raising doubts about the cease-fire efforts.\n\nAt the top U.N. court, Palestinian officials asked Monday to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel faces growing international criticism over the huge cost in civilian lives and the widespread destruction caused by the nearly eight-month war. Israel strongly denies the accusations of genocide.\n\nIsrael's expanding offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah -- once the main hub of humanitarian aid operations -- has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians facing widespread hunger.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground operations in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched the war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Israel declares four hostages are dead in Gaza, including three older men who appeared in video.\n\n-- Biden says Hamas is sufficiently depleted. Israeli leaders disagree, casting doubts over cease-fire.\n\n-- U.S. call for a cease-fire in Gaza puts Netanyahu at a legacy-shaping crossroads.\n\n-- The Israeli army says it investigates itself. Where do those investigations stand?\n\n-- Israel seeks a ' governing alternative ' to Hamas in Gaza. It's been tried and failed before.\n\n-- Israel maintains a shadowy hospital in the desert for Gaza detainees.

Security Council for the three-phase Gaza plan announced by President Joe Biden that would start with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages and lead to an end to the nearly eight-month war and reconstruction.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. circulated a draft resolution Monday to the 14 other council members that would back the proposal.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe brief draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would welcome the May 31 deal announced by Biden and call on Hamas \"to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\" Hamas has said it views the proposal \"positively.\"\n\nThe proposed resolution makes no mention of Israeli acceptance of the deal.\n\nWhen Biden made the announcement he called it an Israeli offer that includes an \"enduring cease-fire\" and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages it is holding.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his hardline governing partners Monday that the proposal announced by Biden would meet Israel's goal of destroying Hamas, according to local media. The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn't eliminate Hamas.\n\nBiden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza, the release of some hostages including women, the elderly and the wounded in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in humanitarian assistance.\n\nIn the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nThe third phase calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nUNITED NATIONS GIVES GRIM UPDATE OF CONDITIONS IN GAZA, SAYING IT'S 'BEYOND CRISIS LEVELS'\n\nUNITED NATIONS - U.N. humanitarian officials are calling public health concerns in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah \"beyond crisis levels,\" where thousands of Palestinians have fled from Israeli attacks in Gaza's south, and local officials are calling several areas in northern Gaza \"disaster zones.\"\n\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported Monday that Israel is bombarding much of the Gaza Strip from the air, sea and land. It said aid operations are severely hindered by Israel's ground operations and fighting, especially in Rafah.\n\nThe office, known as OCHA, said about one million Palestinians who sought safety in Rafah have now fled the Israeli attacks. U.N. and other organizations operating there also had to take flight, OHCA said, including the SOS Children's Village, the only shelter in Gaza for children without parents, which was forced to relocate to central Gaza with limited tents and no room for any more kids.\n\nAndrea De Domenico, head of OCHA's office for the Palestinian territories who returned Friday from three weeks in Gaza, told U.N. reporters from Jerusalem on Monday that destruction and hunger are rampant and the space for Palestinians to flee fighting is narrowing, stressing that nowhere in Gaza is safe. He said OCHA estimates that about 100,000 Palestinians are still in Rafah city.\n\nFor those who fled, he said, living conditions are \"progressively eroding the social fabric of the community in Gaza,\" as Palestinians struggle to survive without electricity, often without shelter, and very little food which they try to heat using plastic and garbage as fuel.\n\nDe Domenico said, \"the rule of the strongest is becoming the only rule that is prevailing,\" giving as an example two brothers fighting over a can of chickpeas, and now not talking to each other.\n\nOCHA said the Emergency Committee for North Gaza municipalities has declared Jabaliya town, Jabaliya refugee camp, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun as \"disaster zones.\"\n\nDe Domenico pointed to the ongoing breakdown of law and order saying two days ago, 70% of the goods picked up by a convoy of trucks on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing were looted, \"I think by criminals but also by desperate people.\"\n\nPOLICE IN SAN FRANCISCO ARREST PRO-PALESTINIAN DEMONSTRATORS IN BUILDING THAT HOUSES ISRAELI CONSULATE\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Police in San Francisco arrested pro-Palestinian demonstrators who occupied the lobby of a building that houses the Israeli Consulate on Monday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many arrests were made but an Associated Press journalist saw police arresting at least a dozen people.\n\nA group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators entered the building and occupied it for several hours Monday. The protesters posted signs on the front doors of the building calling for an end to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nConsul General of Israel to the Pacific Northwest Marco Sermoneta said the protesters arrived around 9 a.m. at the Financial District's high-rise but didn't enter the consulate's offices. He said his office was telling people that they might need to change their appointments.\n\nG7 COUNTRIES FULLY ENDORSE BIDEN'S GAZA CEASE-FIRE PLAN\n\nROME -- The Group of Seven industrialized nations has fully endorsed a cease-fire proposal announced by the United States to try to end Israel's war in Gaza, and has called on Hamas to accept it.\n\nIn a statement released by the Italian presidency Monday, the G7 urged countries with influence over Hamas to ensure that it accepts the deal.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden detailed the three-phase deal on Friday, which calls for a full and complete cease-fire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nIn the statement, the G7 said its leaders \"fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive deal\" that Biden outlined. They reaffirmed support for a credible pathway to peace and a two-state solution.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the statement said.\n\nISRAEL SAYS 4 HOSTAGES FOUND DEAD, INCLUDING 3 OLDER MEN WHO APPEARED IN A HAMAS VIDEO BEGGING FOR THEIR RELEASE\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military on Monday confirmed the deaths of four more hostages held by Hamas -- including three older men seen in a Hamas video begging for their release.\n\nThe three men, Amiram Cooper, Yoram Metzger and Haim Peri, were all age 80 or older. Looking weak and wary, they appeared in a video in December released by Hamas under the title, \"Don't let us grow old here.\"\n\nThe fourth hostage was identified as Nadav Popplewell.\n\nIsrael's military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the four men died together in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis when Israel was operating there. The cause of death was not immediately known.\n\n\"We are checking all of the options,\" Hagari said. \"There are a lot of questions.\"\n\nIsrael carried out a major offensive in Khan Younis, a Hamas stronghold, early this year.\n\nHamas claimed in May that Popplewell had died after being wounded in an Israeli airstrike, but provided no evidence.\n\nPALESTINIAN OFFICIALS APPLY TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE AT THE TOP U.N. COURT ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Palestinian officials have applied at the top U.N. court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe request published Monday says that Israel's ongoing military operation is \"part of a systematic effort to wipe Palestinian society and its culture and social institutions from the map.\"\n\nThe request to the International Court of Justice was made on behalf of the \"State of Palestine\" and signed by Palestinian Authority foreign ministry official Ammar Hijazi. South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice late last year accusing Israel of breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide.\n\nThe court has issued three preliminary orders in the case calling on Israel to do all it can to prevent deaths in the enclave, ramp up humanitarian aid and, most recently, halt its offensive in Rafah.\n\nIt is unclear how long the court's judges will take to rule on the request. If granted, Palestinian officials will be able to address the court in writing and during public hearings.\n\nISRAELI RAID IN NORTHERN WEST BANK KILLS 2 PALESTINIANS, AUTHORITIES SAY\n\nJERUSALEM -- Palestinian authorities said Israeli forces fatally shot two men during a raid in the northern occupied West Bank on Monday.\n\nAccording to Israeli police, the raid was in the northern city of Nablus and an exchange of fire took place between security forces and militants near the Balata refugee camp.\n\nThe Palestinian General Authority for Civil Affairs said the two slain men were in their 20s. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militant group active in the area, identified one of the slain men as one of its fighters.\n\nViolence has flared in the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza broke out in October. Israeli forces launched a multi-day raid into Jenin, another city in the West Bank has long been a bastion of armed struggle against Israel's occupation.\n\nSince the war in Gaza began, over 500 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli fire according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, some in gun battles with Israeli forces, and others shot dead for posing no apparent threat.\n\nFIVE KEY ARAB NATIONS VOICE SUPPORT FOR TALKS ON GAZA CEASE-FIRE AND HOSTAGE RELEASE DEAL\n\nAMMAN, Jordan -- Five key Arab nations say they support efforts to negotiate a permanent cease-fire between Israel and Hamas that would lead to freeing hostages and detainees as well as bringing enough humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates held a virtual meeting Monday. In a statement from Jordan, they emphasized \"dealing seriously and positively\" with U.S. President Joe Biden's proposal. The deal offers the possibility of ending Israel's war against Hamas, returning scores of hostages held by the Islamic militant group, quieting the northern border with Lebanon and potentially advancing a historic agreement for Israel to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe minsters called for the complete withdrawal of Israel's military from the Gaza Strip and starting reconstruction in war-ravaged Gaza, with a framework for reaching a two-state solution \"with specific timings and binding guarantees.\"\n\nQatar and Egypt, along with the U.S., have been mediating the cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\n\n2 MEMBERS OF LEBANON'S HEZBOLLAH GROUP APPARENTLY KILLED IN AN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE\n\nBEIRUT -- The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said Monday that two of its members were killed, announcing the names a few hours after a deadly Israeli drone strike on a car in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Israeli military said its air force targeted an official with Hezbollah's air defense units identifying him as Ali Hussein Sabra. Hezbollah identified one of the two killed with the same name without giving any details about his work within the group.\n\nThe strike came two days after Hezbollah shot down an Israeli Hermes 900 Kochav, a medium-altitude and long-endurance drone that can carry four anti-tank guided missiles.\n\nCross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified in recent weeks, after Israel launched its offensive into the key southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\nIsraeli drone strikes have killed dozens of Hezbollah members since exchanges of fire began on Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began.\n\nSince then, more than 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah members. The dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, at least 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed.\n\nMAN DETAINED IN ROMANIA AFTER ALLEGEDLY ATTACKING THE ISRAELI EMBASSY WITH A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL\n\nBUCHAREST, Romania -- A foreign citizen has been detained in Romania's capital after allegedly attacking the entrance of the Israeli Embassy with a Molotov cocktail. The attack caused a small fire but no casualties, local media and police reported.\n\nA 34-year-old man was apprehended by antiterrorism officers from the Romanian Intelligence Service before police arrived at the scene, police in Bucharest said, adding that the suspect allegedly also tried to set himself on fire.\n\nA police spokesperson told local news channel Digi24 that the incident was motivated by personal grievances and not by the international context of Israel's ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. Police said that investigations are underway to establish the circumstances of the incident.\n\nNETANYAHU REPORTEDLY SAYS A CEASE-FIRE PROPOSAL WOULD MEET GOAL OF ELIMINATING HAMAS\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has not backed down from his goal of destroying Hamas and told his hard-line governing partners that a cease-fire proposal pushed by U.S. President Joe Biden would meet that goal, or else Israel would return to war, according to local media.\n\nNetanyahu has faced a backlash from ultranationalists in his coalition who have threatened to bring down his government if he agrees to a deal that would end the war in Gaza without eliminating Hamas.\n\nBiden last week announced what he called an Israeli offer that includes an \"enduring cease-fire\" and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages it is holding. The outline released by the Biden administration does not explicitly talk of removing Hamas from governing Gaza or eliminating it. But in a speech Friday, Biden said Israel's 8-month-old offensive had degraded the militants to a point where they could no longer carry out an Oct. 7 attack.\n\nNetanyahu told the parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that there are certain \"gaps\" in Biden's announcement. \"Biden spoke about the outline but not all of the details,\" he said during the closed-door session, according to Israeli media. He said that in the Biden plan, there are built-in measures to ensure all sides are upholding the deal before it progresses to the next stage.\n\n\"We reserve the right to return to war,\" Netanyahu told the committee, according to the media reports.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Security Council support for the deal's acceptance and implementation.\n\nA draft U.S. resolution seen by VOA calls on Hamas to fully accept and implement the cease-fire proposal \"without delay and without condition.\"\n\nThe draft says, \"swift implementation of this deal would enable a ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas in Gaza, the release of hostages, a surge in humanitarian assistance, restoration of basic services, and the return of Palestinian civilians to northern Gaza.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday that Hamas, which received the cease-fire proposal Thursday, had yet to respond. He said the major elements of the proposal \"are nearly identical to the major elements of the proposal that Hamas submitted several weeks ago.\"\n\nThe basic outline of the deal includes a six-week halt in fighting, the release of some hostages from Gaza, daily deliveries of 600 trucks of aid for Palestinians and further negotiations aimed at securing a permanent end to the conflict.\n\nU.S. officials reiterated Monday that the cease-fire proposal, though presented publicly by U.S. President Joe Biden last week, is an Israeli proposal.\n\nA Palestinian child pulls water containers, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, in southern Gaza City, June 3, 2024.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that making public negotiations that officials have declined to reveal in the past for fear of disrupting the negotiation process was not about putting pressure on Israeli officials, but rather, if anything, publicly pressuring Hamas and its leaders to accept the deal.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here, catalyze a different outcome,\" Kirby said.\n\nKirby said in earlier comments to reporters that if Hamas were to accept the proposal, Israel would as well.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a parliament committee Monday that \"claims that we have agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met are incorrect,\" according to a statement from his office.\n\nAn Israeli government spokesperson said 'the war will be stopped for the purpose of returning the hostages' after which discussions would follow on how to achieve Israel's goal of eliminating Hamas\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations issued a joint statement Monday fully endorsing the cease-fire proposal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the statement said.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates said after a virtual meeting Monday that they support efforts to negotiate a permanent cease-fire, while also emphasizing \"dealing seriously and positively\" with the proposal outlined by Biden.\n\nThe ministers called for Israel's full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the return of displaced Palestinians to areas they fled, the launch of reconstruction efforts in Gaza, and the implementation of a two-state solution, according to a statement release by Jordan's foreign ministry.\n\nA Palestinian man holds the hand of a little boy as they walk past the rubble of destroyed buildings in the Jabalia refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip on June 3, 2024.\n\nHumanitarian challenges\n\nU.N. humanitarian officials say the fighting in Gaza, particularly in northern and southern Gaza, is making it increasingly difficult to deliver badly needed assistance to the Palestinians.\n\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in its latest update Monday that the situation in Rafah is particularly difficult, with World Food Program workers only able to reach 27,000 people with hot meals and humanitarian workers unable to provide services amid intensified hostilities and evacuation orders.\n\nThe agency said the fighting in Rafah has forced the displacement of about one million people. Many of those who were in Rafah had gone there after fleeing other parts of Gaza in search of safety.\n\nHamas launched a terror attack Oct. 7 on Israel, killing about 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies and taking roughly 250 hostages. About 120 of the hostages remain in Gaza, including 37 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardments and ground offensive have killed at least 36,400 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The death toll includes both civilians and combatants.\n\nSome information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.", "source": {"uri":

A resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the U.S., France, Britain, China or Russia to pass.\n\nThe draft calls on Hamas to accept the deal and \"fully implement its terms without delay and without condition.\" It also \"stresses the importance of the parties adhering to the terms of the deal once agreed, with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities.\"\n\nThe U.S. proposal comes a week after Algeria proposed a draft Security Council resolution demanding a Gaza ceasefire, release of all hostages held by Hamas and essentially ordering Israel to \"immediately halt its military offensive\" in Rafah.\n\nAt home and abroad, Israel is facing growing pressure to accept the deal, with Israeli protesters urging the government to secure the return of hostages while the international community growing ever more concerned about the rising civilian deaths in Gaza.\n\nColombia, which broke its diplomatic ties with Israel last month, said on Monday the Israeli ambassador to Colombia needs to leave the country before June 30.\n\nAlso on Monday, over 20 UN experts and special rapporteurs called on all countries to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nThe UN now has more than 140 member states that recognize Palestine as a state.

Qatari mediators passed the four-and-a-half-page document on to Hamas on Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not explicitly backed the main points in the cease-fire proposal Biden laid out, although his office said in a statement Friday evening that the phased proposal would meet Israel's objectives, including the return of the hostages and \"the neutralization of Hamas' military and governance capabilities.\"\n\nOn Saturday, however, the prime minister's office released another statement saying that its conditions for ending the war are unchanged.\n\n\"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter,\" the statement said.\n\nA top aide of the Israeli prime minister on Sunday said Netanyahu's office has agreed to its framework, but said it was \"not a good deal.\" Israeli media reported that its terms were approved by the war cabinet.\n\nThe White House denied that Biden's move was an effort to force Netanyahu's hand after months of stalled negotiations facilitated by Qatar and Egypt.\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister and the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal.\"\n\nAsked about the Israeli reaction, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday that the administration is \"completely confident\" that Israel will go along with what is \"ultimately an Israeli proposal.\"\n\n\"This is a proposal that's in the long-term security interest of Israel,\" Miller said, adding that the deal would help restore calm along the northern border with Lebanon and bolster Israel's regional integration.\n\nThe apparent differences between the United States and Israel on end-state objectives in Gaza was compounded by lingering questions as to who would govern the enclave in the wake of the proposed Israeli military withdrawal -- a key sticking point not addressed by the latest cease-fire proposal.\n\n\"It does not mean just because it's not in that proposal, that we're not still working those objectives,\" Kirby told reporters Monday.\n\nNetanyahu faces domestic pressure from the families of Israeli hostages to accept the proposal outlined by Biden. On Saturday, more than 100,000 Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv to demonstrate in favor of the deal.\n\nBut he also is under pressure from far-right ministers with the power to bring down his government. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, have threatened to quit Netanyahu's fragile governing coalition if the deal moves forward before Hamas is decisively defeated.\n\nThe three-phase plan starts with the two sides observing a \"full and complete cease-fire\" for six weeks, Israel withdrawing its forces from populated areas of Gaza and Hamas releasing women, elderly and wounded hostages in return for hundreds of Palestinians jailed in Israel.\n\nBiden described phase two as a \"permanent end to hostilities,\" with Israel fully withdrawing from Gaza and Hamas releasing all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers.\n\nA major reconstruction plan for Gaza would begin in phase three, and the militant group would return the remains of the hostages who died in captivity.\n\nDavid Makovsky, an adviser for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Obama administration who is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the \"irreconcilable differences\" between Israel and Hamas will make phases two and three difficult to implement.\n\nHamas' demand for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza has long been a snag in cease-fire negotiations. After Biden's speech Friday, the militant group said in a statement it was ready \"to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent cease-fire.\"\n\n\"Israel is not going to leave unless it knows Hamas cannot reconstitute itself, and Hamas is not going to go for a deal that means it can't reconstitute itself,\" Makovsky said. \"And that's the catch-22 here.\"\n\nMiller said Monday that the negotiators had yet to receive an answer from Hamas on the deal, which a senior administration official on Friday described as \"nearly identical\" to a previous version accepted by the group, \"with some very minor adjustments.\"\n\nIn a phone call Monday with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Biden \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas,\" according to a White House readout. Biden urged the emir \"to use all appropriate measures to secure Hamas' acceptance of the deal.\"\n\nSecretary State Antony Blinken also pushed for the deal in separate calls with Israeli war cabinet members on Sunday, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and opposition politician Benny Gantz.\n\nThe latest US push for a cease-fire comes as Israeli forces move deeper into Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza where more than one million Palestinians have fled since Israel began its offensive there nearly a month ago. The Palestinian death toll on Monday surpassed 36,000, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.\n\nPentagon officials say the Israeli military's ground incursion into Rafah remains limited but that they are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure its remains in line with parameters laid out the Biden administration. Privately, administration officials are betting that Israel's military leadership is unwilling to incur the costs of continuing the campaign at full strength.\n\n\"Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory ... will only bog down Israel in Gaza, draining [its] economic, military and human resources and furthering Israel's isolation in the world,\" Biden said in his speech on Friday.\n\nWhile Biden has vowed never to cut off defensive weapons to Israel, such as US-made Iron Dome interceptor missiles, his administration has placed under review planned transfers of certain offensive weapons which the Israeli military could use should it launch \"a major ground operation\" in Rafah.\n\nWithholding limited arms transfers alone is not likely to prevent the Israeli military's ability to launch a devastating attack on Rafah, Al-Monitor previously reported. But it could potentially limit the military's offensive capabilities should war break out with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe warning underscored Washington's pressure on Israeli leaders to rely less on blunt military force and more on special operations combined with US-backed diplomacy in order to achieve Israeli strategic objectives against its Iran-backed adversaries. But critics of the Biden administration's approach have argued that any alleviation of Israeli military pressure on Hamas only reduces the group's political will to compromise in negotiations.",

He added that Biden had not revealed all the details of a possible deal.\n\nWhen asked in the interview whether Netanyahu was prolonging the war against Hamas to remain in power, Biden replied: \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nHe added: \"Bibi [Netanyahu] is under enormous pressure on the hostages and so he's prepared to do about anything to get the hostages back.\"\n\nBiden also described the Israeli proposal as \"very generous\", and said White House officials have laid out a five-year reconstruction plan for the devastated enclave if the war ends.\n\nOn Monday the leaders of the G7 issued a statement backing the plan, while the US circulated a draft resolution at the UN Security Council seeking its backing so as to push Hamas to accept the deal.\n\nWashington's diplomatic efforts coupled with Biden's criticism of the Israeli leader have increased the pressure on Netanyahu to reject demands by his far-right coalition allies to reject any deal that is contingent on a lasting ceasefire.\n\nThe efforts to secure a release of the hostages held by Hamas became even more urgent after Israel's military confirmed on Monday that four had been killed in Gaza. Israel estimates that almost a third of the 124 people that were still being held are now dead.\n\nBiden has also spoken to Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, urging him \"to use all appropriate measures to secure Hamas's acceptance of the deal\".\n\nThe White House has also sought to get Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who backs Hamas's political goals, to declare his support the deal.\n\nUS officials acknowledged that it was unusual for the president to publicly back a proposal to end the conflict after others have failed.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energise the process here, catalyse a different outcome,\" said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.\n\nThe current deal, while more ambitious than the last hostage-for-prisoner swap, envisions a first six-week phase where Israeli civilians and female soldiers held by Hamas are traded for Palestinian prisoners, before moving to a second phase where male soldiers are freed for a longer-term ceasefire.\n\nIt would then move to an effort to seek security arrangements and reconstruction for the Gaza Strip, but Biden acknowledged in the interview that he and Netanyahu remained far apart on the details.\n\n\"My major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after, what happens after Gaza's over? What does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work,\" he said.\n\nHamas has signalled its \"readiness to deal positively\" with the proposal, tying its posture to the ceasefire, followed by reconstruction for the devastated enclave dangled by Biden.\n\nHamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan told journalists in Beirut on Tuesday that the group was concerned Israel would resume the war after the first batch of hostages was released, and was seeking assurances over the terms of the ceasefire and subsequent withdrawal of Israeli troops before proceeding with the talks.\n\n\"That's what can open the door wider to an agreement -- as long as this position is not clear, we will not agree to any deal,\" he said. \"We now wait for the clear Israeli position on this question.\"\n\nHamas killed at least 1,200 people, including civilians and soldiers, in Israel on October 7, and took some 240 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli officials.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory war in the blockaded Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,470 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to local officials.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com",

The scenes of destruction & suffering of people are heart-wrenching\".\n\n\"There is a serious proposal on the table - outlined by President Biden - and I urge all parties to reach an agreement immediately to achieve a ceasefire and return the hostages. There is no alternative - and any delay, every day simply costs more lives,\" he posted on social media platform X.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer earlier quoted Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying that the outline Biden presented was only \"partial\", and that under the plan fighting would only stop temporarily \"for the purpose of returning the hostages\".\n\nNetanyahu, a hawkish veteran leading a fragile hard-right coalition government, is under intense domestic pressure from multiple sides.\n\nRelatives and supporters of hostages have staged mass protests demanding a truce deal - but his far-right coalition allies are threatening to bring down the government if he agrees to that.\n\nOngoing strikes\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli strikes continued early Tuesday, particularly in Bureij in central Gaza where local hospital sources reported several deaths.\n\nIn northern Israel, firefighters and troops were battling forest blazes after rocket fire from neighbouring Lebanon, with the border area the scene of near-daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli army and the Hezbollah militant group, an ally of Hamas, since the start of the war in Gaza nearly eight months ago.\n\nIsrael's military on Monday announced the deaths in Gaza of four hostages seized during the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel, naming them as Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Israeli-British citizen Nadav Popplewell.\n\nTheir bodies were still in the hands of Hamas, it added.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title":

The move diverged from the U.S. administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal -- which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNETANYAHU FACING PRESSURE FROM FAR-RIGHT\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nOPTIMISM DESPITE HEADWINDS\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the U.S. Global Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nEVEN GETTING TO PHASE ONE IS A CHALLENGE\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one -- and the six-week pause in fighting -- would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.", "source": {"uri":

He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability on June 3 when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Mr. Biden laid out the proposal. The Prime Minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nMr. Kirby played down differences between Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Mr. Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Mr. Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Mr. Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Mr. Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nMr. Smotrich said on June 3 that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nMr. Biden last week expressed concern about those in the Israeli government who \"want to keep fighting for years\" and don't see freeing the hostages as a \"priority.\" Administration officials on June 3 warned Israeli officials that getting bogged down in Gaza could be detrimental to Israel's national security.\n\n\"Endless conflict in Gaza in pursuit of some idea of total victory is not going to make Israel safer,\" said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.\n\nMr. Netanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants in the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Mr. Sullivan said in an appearance at the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Mr. Biden on June 3 spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nAmbassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, said the U.S. circulated a draft resolution seeking support for the proposal from the 14 other members of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nMr. Sullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on June 3 also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nMr. Biden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one -- and the six-week pause in fighting -- would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Mr. Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.\n\nRead Comments",

He said the major elements of the proposal \"are nearly identical to the major elements of the proposal that Hamas submitted several weeks ago.\"\n\nThe basic outline of the deal includes a six-week halt in fighting, the release of some hostages from Gaza, daily deliveries of 600 trucks of aid for Palestinians and further negotiations aimed at securing a permanent end to the conflict.\n\nU.S. officials reiterated Monday that the cease-fire proposal, though presented publicly by U.S. President Joe Biden last week, is an Israeli proposal.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that making public negotiations that officials have declined to reveal in the past for fear of disrupting the negotiation process was not about putting pressure on Israeli officials, but rather, if anything, publicly pressuring Hamas and its leaders to accept the deal.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here, catalyze a different outcome,\" Kirby said.\n\nKirby said in earlier comments to reporters that if Hamas were to accept the proposal, Israel would as well.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a parliament committee Monday that \"claims that we have agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met are incorrect,\" according to a statement from his office.\n\nAn Israeli government spokesperson said \"the war will be stopped for the purpose of returning the hostages\" after which discussions would follow on how to achieve Israel's goal of eliminating Hamas\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations issued a joint statement Monday fully endorsing the cease-fire proposal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the statement said.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates said after a virtual meeting Monday that they support efforts to negotiate a permanent cease-fire, while also emphasizing \"dealing seriously and positively\" with the proposal outlined by Biden.\n\nThe ministers called for Israel's full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the return of displaced Palestinians to areas they fled, the launch of reconstruction efforts in Gaza, and the implementation of a two-state solution, according to a statement release by Jordan's foreign ministry.\n\nHumanitarian challenges\n\nU.N. humanitarian officials say the fighting in Gaza, particularly in northern and southern Gaza, is making it increasingly difficult to deliver badly needed assistance to the Palestinians.\n\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in its latest update Monday that the situation in Rafah is particularly difficult, with World Food Program workers only able to reach 27,000 people with hot meals and humanitarian workers unable to provide services amid intensified hostilities and evacuation orders.\n\nThe agency said the fighting in Rafah has forced the displacement of about one million people. Many of those who were in Rafah had gone there after fleeing other parts of Gaza in search of safety.\n\nHamas launched a terror attack Oct. 7 on Israel, killing about 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies and taking roughly 250 hostages. About 120 of the hostages remain in Gaza, including 37 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardments and ground offensive have killed at least 36,400 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The death toll includes both civilians and combatants.\n\nSome information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com",

The move diverged from the US administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energise the process here and catalyse a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal -- which includes a ceasefire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNETANYAHU FACING PRESSURE FROM FAR-RIGHT\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war\".\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one.\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a ceasefire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender.\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants in the October 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nOPTIMISM DESPITE HEADWINDS\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security advisor Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the US Global Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement\", the White House said.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\nEVEN GETTING TO PHASE ONE IS A CHALLENGE\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a ceasefire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security advisor Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the US now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

Civilians would be allowed to move across Gaza, including the north, with 600 trucks carrying humanitarian aid into the enclave daily.\n\nIn the second phase, Hamas and Israel would negotiate terms for a permanent end to hostilities, although Biden said that the ceasefire would continue for \"as long as negotiations continue\".\n\nThe third phase of the plan would include a permanent ceasefire, which would allow for the reconstruction of the enclave, and an ultimate final end to a devastating war in which Israel has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.\n\nNot exactly.\n\nWhile Biden framed the proposal as an Israeli peace plan, the reaction from Israel's leadership has not been clear. It appears as though the country's coalition government is bitterly - and possibly permanently - divided.\n\nThe cabinet's two far-right members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have rejected the proposal outright, and have threatened to bring down the government.\n\nIt doesn't seem so, and Ben-Gvir said that Netanyahu's office had not produced a deal for him to read despite promising to do so.\n\nNetanyahu himself has been attempting to disassociate himself from the project, despite the US repeatedly stating that the plan came from the Israeli side.\n\nOn Saturday, a day after Biden publicly announced the deal, Netanyahu interrupted the Jewish holy day, the Sabbath, to declare any permanent ceasefire a \"non-starter\".\n\n\"Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: The destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel,\" Netanyahu said, reiterating a position that seems to contradict the peace proposal.\n\nNetanyahu and Israel's right wing appear especially troubled by the second phase of the plan, which has their negotiators still dealing with Hamas, a group the US claims has been so depleted that it is no longer capable of carrying out a repeat of its October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nLeaving aside the question of whether Netanyahu himself has any desire to end this war, the prime minister will struggle to keep his coalition together if he agrees to any plan without approval from all of his government.\n\nWar cabinet member - and potential Netanyahu replacement - Benny Gantz has not opposed the proposal, and ultra-Orthodox politicians from the Shas and United Torah Judaism parties, both members of the governing coalition, have also backed the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to lend Netanyahu the votes he needs to get this issue through the Israeli parliament, or Knesset.\n\nHowever, that would only give Netanyahu the seats he needs to get the ceasefire proposals through and not the support he needs to maintain his place at the head of government.\n\nFor that, he still needs Smotrich and Ben-Gvir.\n\nThere's also a lingering suspicion among many that Netanyahu wants to continue the war in order to avoid corruption charges he faces.\n\nIn fact, when asked whether Netanyahu wanted to carry on the war so that he could continue in power, Biden responded by saying that there was \"every reason for people to draw that conclusion\".\n\nIn a nutshell, to colonise Gaza and force its population to \"voluntarily emigrate\".\n\nTaking to social media, Smotrich said he had \"made it clear\" to Netanyahu that he was not ready to \"be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the hostages\".\n\nBen-Gvir wasn't happy, either. \"If the prime minister implements the reckless deal under the conditions published today, which mean the end of the war and the giving up on the elimination of Hamas, Jewish Power [his far-right party] will dissolve the government,\" the national security minister wrote.\n\nAllies - including the US - are becoming more and more open in their criticism of Israel.\n\nAside from his jab at Netanyahu's priorities, Biden and other senior US officials have increasingly issued public statements that diverge from the Israeli line.\n\nBut there's a limit, and the Biden administration is still adamant that Hamas is to blame for the lack of progress on the peace deal, despite the Palestinian group responding positively in its public statements, and the similarities between the plan announced by Biden and the plan Hamas said it had accepted in early May.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Biden \"affirmed that Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\". The United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary David Cameron adopted a similar tone, saying \"The first thing that needs to happen is that Hamas need[s] to accept this deal\". Germany, meanwhile, couched the deal as a glimpse of hope to free the captives being held by Hamas and to halt Palestinian deaths in Gaza.\n\nInquiries from Al Jazeera to the US Department of State asking about the source of these latest proposals have gone unanswered. Likewise, requests to view the plan have also elicited no response.\n\nAccording to reports, the plan was proposed by Israel's three-man war cabinet in the middle of last week, with Netanyahu's initial objections being overcome by the arguments of officials and the cabinet's other two members.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Qatar's foreign ministry said that it had received an Israeli proposal for a deal for the release of captives held in Gaza that reflected the principles laid out by Biden.\n\nHamas now says it views the offer \"positively\", with a senior official saying that \"it will go for this deal\" if Israel does. Hamas official Osama Hamdan said on Tuesday that any deal would have to include a permanent ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza - which are both stipulated as part of the third phase of the proposal referred to by Biden.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_speakman_cordall@aljazeera.com", "name": "Simon

The ultranationalists have threatened to bring down his government if Netanyahu agrees to a deal that doesn't eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu told parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that Biden gave an outline of the deal but not all the details, and he said there are \"gaps.\"\n\nBiden said the first phase of the proposed deal would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza and the release of some hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAmerican hostages would be released at this stage, and remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families. There would be a surge in humanitarian assistance, with 600 trucks a day entering Gaza.\n\nIn the second phase, all the rest of the living hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Biden said if Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become a \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nAbout 250 people, mainly Israeli civilians, were abducted on Oct. 7, then more than 100 were freed in a short truce in late November and early December. Israel says about 80 hostages are believed to still be captive, alongside the remains of about 43 others.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled, have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe third phase of the plan announced by Biden calls for the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which faces decades of rebuilding from devastation caused by the war.\n\nThe draft resolution stresses the importance of Israel and Hamas adhering to the deal once it is agreed to, \"with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities, and calls upon all member states and the United Nations to support its implementation.\"\n\nThe draft would also reiterate the council's \"unwavering commitment\" to a two-state solution, and stress the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador, said Security Council members \"have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"\n\n\"Council members should not let this opportunity pass by,\" she said. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, the foreign ministers of five key Arab nations -- Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt -- urged Israel and Hamas to consider Biden's proposal \"seriously and positively.\"\n\nThe group of seven major industrialized nations -- the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy -- also backed the cease-fire plan.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@stltoday.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "edith_m_lederer@stltoday.com", "name": "Edith M.

The next stage, which would be negotiated during the six-week cease-fire, would include a \"permanent end to hostilities\" and the release of all remaining hostages, which includes male soldiers. The last step is the movement toward a \"major reconstruction\" plan for Gaza that would include the return of the remains of dead hostages to their families.\n\nBiden emphasized it was up to Hamas to accept the deal.\n\nBut Israel's stance on it all became murky in the following hours and over the weekend as Netanyahu insisted Israel remains steadfast on destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities as a condition for ending the war. During his remarks on Friday, Biden declared that Hamas is \"no longer capable\" of carrying out another Oct. 7, the day in which Hamas attacked Israel, leaving about 1,200 people dead and sparking the war.\n\nTwo members of Netanyahu's government have since threatened to leave if the prime minister endorsed the proposal that Biden said Israel already sent Hamas, appearing to complicate matters for the Israeli leader and add to the confusion.\n\nKirby on Monday insisted that while \"diplomatic efforts\" by the U.S. played a role, the potential deal announced by Biden was Israel's own proposal.\n\n\"It's the result of our own diplomatic efforts with Israel but it is their proposal that they have, again, publicly acknowledged is in fact, their proposal,\" he said, adding that the U.S. did inform Israel that Biden was going to give remarks on the plan on Friday.\n\nWhile Biden said the third phase of the potential deal would focus on the movement toward a \"major reconstruction\" plan for Gaza, there was no talk on Friday of a two-state solution - something Biden has said is the only answer for the future and Netanyahu has pushed back on.\n\nAsked about the lack of mention of a Palestinian state during Biden's remarks, Kirby said the proposal \"is primarily designed to do three things: get hostages out, again in a phased approach, get more humanitarian aid in, again, in a phased approach, hopefully up to 600 trucks a day, and then get a ceasefire in place.\"\n\n\"It doesn't talk about a two state solution or what the day after governance could look like because that's not what it's about, it's really about getting the hostages home,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_Biden_Trump_Verdict_053124", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2302, "textEnd": 2308}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The move diverged from the US administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energise the process here and catalyse a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlso Read | Mexico Presidential Election Result 2024: Claudia Sheinbaum Wins by Record-Breaking Mandate, Becomes First Woman To Hold the Job.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal -- which includes a ceasefire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNETANYAHU FACING PRESSURE FROM FAR-RIGHT\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war\".\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one.\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a ceasefire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender.\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants in the October 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nOPTIMISM DESPITE HEADWINDS\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security advisor Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the US Global Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement\", the White House said.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\nEVEN GETTING TO PHASE ONE IS A CHALLENGE Biden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a ceasefire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security advisor Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the US now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.

If Hamas abided by the agreement's terms, the president said, it would ultimately lead to the \"cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\n\"It's time to end this war,\" Biden said\n\nTwo-far-right members of Netanyahu's governing coalition, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, said on Monday that they could not accept any deal that stops short of completely eliminating Hamas.\n\nAs Biden described it Friday, the Israeli military's attacks in Gaza had already eliminated Hamas as a major threat, and that \"at this point, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another Oct. 7.\"\n\nBut in the views of Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, whose parties make up a small but critical piece of Netanyahu's majority, the proposal does not go far enough to guarantee Hamas' destruction. The men on Monday threatened to pull out of the coalition, taking down the government with them, should the prime minister accept a deal that stops short of destroying Hamas.\n\n\"If the government, God forbid, decides to adopt this proposal of surrender, we will no longer be a part of it and we will take action to replace the failing leadership with a new leadership that knows how to defeat Hamas and win the war,\" Smotrich said.\n\nBen-Gvir said that what Biden presented would mean \"the surrender of Israel\" and \"the end of the war without achieving its main goal, the destruction of Hamas.\"\n\nWithout Ben-Gvir's party, which holds six parliamentary seats, and Smotrich's party, which holds seven, Netanyahu would likely struggle to remain in office.\n\nNetanyahu told the legislators Monday that he would not agree to completely end the war without Hamas' defeat or surrender, said the person in the meeting. The prime minister's office reiterated that point in a statement, saying, \"The claims that we have agreed to a cease-fire without our conditions being met are incorrect.\"\n\nNetanyahu's comments underscored how he has struggled to navigate competing pressures from Israel's allies and the international community, which are demanding a stop to the fighting, and his right-wing coalition partners who want Israel to forge ahead in Gaza until Hamas is eliminated.\n\nShira Efron, a senior director of policy research at the Israel Policy Forum, said that although Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were part of a \"once-in-a-lifetime coalition,\" they were willing to topple Netanyahu's government and lose their powerful ministerial posts in the process.\n\n\"They're true ideologues,\" she said in an interview.\n\nBiden had anticipated that the plan would be unacceptable to some members of the Israeli government, Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesperson, said Monday.\n\n\"And of course, we've seen some members of the Israeli government already come out and oppose it,\" Miller said. But he said that the proposal was \"in the long-term security interests of Israel. It's obviously in the long-term interests of the Palestinian people, as well.\"\n\nMiller said that since Biden announced the plan Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had spoken to the foreign ministers of Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. He had also spoken to Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war Cabinet, and to Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant.\n\n\"We're completely confident,\" that Israel supports the cease-fire plan, Miller said, adding that it was submitted last week to Hamas, which has yet to formally respond.\n\nHamas has said it \"positively views\" the proposal as described by Biden on Friday. It has not said whether it would accept the deal. On Sunday, Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, told an Egyptian news outlet that \"the ball\" was now \"in the Israeli court.\"\n\nNetanyahu has insisted that the cease-fire proposal would enable Israel to continue fighting Hamas until all its war aims are achieved, including destroying the military and governing capabilities of the group, which led the deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nTwo Israeli officials confirmed that the offer shared by Biden generally aligned with the most recent cease-fire proposal that Israel had presented in talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt.\n\nAs much as the world's focus has been trained on the spiraling death toll and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in Israel the focus is on the safety and release of the hostages, many of them civilians, captured Oct. 7 and taken to Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military said Monday that it had confirmed that four of the hostages -- Haim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popplewell -- were dead. It said the circumstances of their deaths were under investigation and their bodies were still being held by Hamas.\n\n\"We estimate the four were killed together in the area of Khan Younis several months ago, while held by Hamas terrorists, while the Israel Defense Forces were operating in Khan Younis,\" said an Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.\n\nResponding to the military's announcement, the Hostages Families Forum, a group that represents relatives of the hostages, said it was even more critical for the government to secure a deal to free the remaining hostages.\n\n\"The Israeli government must send out a negotiating delegation this evening and return all 124 hostages, both living and murdered, to their homes,\" the group said, adding: \"We reiterate our demand to the Israeli government: approve the Netanyahu deal immediately!\"\n\nAdding to the political pressures on Netanyahu, Gantz, a centrist, has threatened to leave the emergency wartime government unless the prime minister agrees by June 8 -- this Saturday -- to a plan that brings home the hostages, addresses the future governance of Gaza, returns displaced Israelis to their homes and advances normalization with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"If you choose the path of zealots, dragging the country into the abyss, we will be forced to leave the government,\" Gantz said in a televised news conference last month. \"We will turn to the people and build a government that will earn the people's trust.\"\n\nAlso on Monday, Israeli drones hit areas deep inside Lebanon, killing one person and wounding another, in retaliation for launches by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement from southern Lebanon into northern Israel.\n\nIsraeli drones targeted a car in the town of Kawthariyat al-Rez in Sidon district and a motorbike in al-Naqoura.\n\nThe state-run National News Agency said one person was killed and another was injured in the Naqoura strike.\n\nThe Israeli army confirmed the strikes and said its warplanes struck the area of Tyre in southern Lebanon and \"eliminated the terrorist Ali Hussein Sabra.\"\n\nThe army said Sabra was involved in efforts to equip and enhance Hezbollah's Aerial Defense Unit, in reference to the drone launches by the movement.\n\nIt added that they also struck Hezbollah's infrastructure and several military compounds used by the Hezbollah aerial defense in the area of Qotrani in southern Lebanon.\n\nA Lebanese security source described the situation in southern Lebanon Monday as \"real war grounds.\"\n\nHezbollah in a statement said in support of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and \"in response to the assassination carried out by the Israeli enemy this afternoon ... the Islamic Resistance [Hezbollah] launched an air attack with a squadron of assault drones on the new [Israeli] leadership headquarters\" in northern Israel.\n\nThe pro-Iranian movement claimed direct hits.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's heavy shelling caused several fires in fields in the Western Bekaa region and southern Lebanon.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami

And then got started on his speech to save Hamas.\n\nThere was nothing accidental about the timing of the speech on Friday afternoon at a time when much of America's political establishment was heading out for the weekend while Israeli Jews were celebrating the Sabbath and many of them were not even using electronic devices.\n\nAfter celebrating former President Trump's conviction, Biden announced a new deal under which Hamas would rule Gaza, get billions in U.S. aid and dozens of its terrorists would be released from prison in exchange for every hostage. Or every hostage's dead body.\n\nUnder the terms of Biden's proposal, Hamas wins and Israel gets back survivors and corpses.\n\nFinally, American taxpayers will be on the hook for an \"extensive three- to five-year reconstruction program for Gaza that's fully backed by us\" that will cost endless billions.\n\nThe deal that Biden laid out gives Hamas everything it wanted including staying in power. An end to Israeli attempts to eliminate the terror group. And all the money it could possibly need. Rather than an Israeli proposal, this is almost the exact same 'ceasefire' deal that Hamas, Qatar and Egypt had assembled and that Hamas then made a show of accepting a few weeks ago.\n\nAll Biden did was brush off the Hamas proposal and then declare that it was the Israeli proposal.\n\nIndeed, a follow-up call with a senior White House official had him admit that, \"it's nearly identical to Hamas's own proposals of only a few weeks ago\" and that \"what is now in front of everybody is basically the terms by which Hamas was prepared to move forward.\"\n\nAgain, he repeated, \"Hamas has said they'd be prepared to do deal X, and what is now on the table is basically that with some very minor adjustments.\"\n\nBiden described the Hamas proposal as the \"Israeli proposal\" and urged Israel to accept it. In reality, he had taken an Israeli counter-proposal, changed crucial elements so that it matched Hamas demands at a time when the Israeli government would not be able to respond and unveiled it to the world while daring Israelis to call him a liar. All to save Islamic terrorists.\n\nNetanyahu poured cold water on the proposal, stating that, \"Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: The destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place. The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.\"\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that the country would \"not accept Hamas rule\" and was fighting to destroy Hamas and liberate the hostages.\n\nBenny Gantz, the third member of the 'war cabinet' whom the Biden administration had been relying on to force acceptance of the deal, made no initial statement at all. An anonymous White House official expressed \"disappointment\" that he hadn't endorsed the proposal. When he did issue a statement, it was a confusing word salad that praised Biden but stated \"the State of Israel stands united in our wish to return the hostages, it is a superior moral obligation that does not diminish our commitment to achieve the war's objectives\".\n\nSo much for the \"Israeli proposal\".\n\nNot a single member of the Israeli government had explicitly gotten behind Biden's proposal to leave Hamas in power (or with a fig leaf \"technocratic\" government to handle the foreign aid.) Neither did they explicitly take on the Biden administration by disavowing it. And the Biden administration is doubling down on forcing Israelis to accept the proposal and save Hamas.\n\nHad this really been an Israeli proposal, it would not have been announced on the Sabbath, and would have been featured at a press conference in Israel. Instead, it was met with uncomfortable silence and awkward statements in Jerusalem. The pressure campaign out of D.C. on specific Israeli government officials made it all too clear whose \"proposal\" this really was.\n\nThis is a proposal by Hamas and its allies, Egypt and Qatar, along with Hamas allies in the Biden administration who are fighting to keep it alive, that Biden is imposing on Israel.\n\nIt's a proposal to allow Hamas to cash out hostages and their bodies in exchange for victory.\n\nWhile the Biden administration demanded that the Israeli government endorse his proposal, there were no such expectations of Hamas.\n\nThe White House on a follow-up call claimed that Hamas \"just got this last night\" and that he was \"not going to respond to public statements made by some Hamas officials here and there. They know what's in the deal. They know it's nearly identical to what they put on the table.\"\n\nHamas, the administration, claimed \"know what's in the deal\" but also \"just got this\" and what Hamas leaders say does not matter because they keep saying that they intend to go on attacking Israel until it is destroyed and that flies in the face of a \"permanent ceasefire.\"\n\nThe White House official announced that the administration will ignore Hamas promises to go on waging terror as part of a cover-up to push the Hamas proposal to save the terror group.\n\nHe also explicitly rejected the Israeli expectation Hamas would be destroyed.\n\nIntroducing his proposal, Biden claimed that it \"would bring about a better 'day after' in Gaza without Hamas in power\" and then laid out a deal with Hamas that would keep the Islamic terror group in power. Having begun his speech with a lie, he kept on lying all through the rest of it.\n\nBut Biden assured Israelis that they don't have to worry. \"The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they've devastated Hamas form- -- forces over the past eight months. At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7th.\".\n\nGetting to that \"point\" took 8 months of fighting and over 600 Israeli soldiers killed in action.\n\nHow long will it take Hamas to rearm and rebuild especially once Biden's proposed \"major reconstruction plan for Gaza\" moves billions of dollars into the terror zone? Months? Years?\n\nAnd how many people will die in the next terror attack enabled and financed by Biden?\n\nThe Biden administration had assured Israel that it had nothing to worry about from Hamas in the weeks before Oct 7 when a deal was reached. The assurances are just as worthless now.\n\nBut Biden promised Israelis that \"Egypt and Qatar have assured me and they are continuing to work to ensure that Hamas doesn't do that.\" Qatar is a state sponsor of Hamas and other Islamic terrorist groups while Egypt was caught red-handed propping up the Egyptian origin terror group which had begun as part of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and began carrying out terrorist attacks under Egyptian sponsorship while Gaza was under Egyptian occupation.\n\nThe state sponsors of terrorism will police the terrorists. And Biden will police Israel.\n\nBiden's deal is \"nearly identical to Hamas's own proposals\", it saves the Islamic terrorist group just as it's on the brink of destruction, and commits America to financing its reconstruction.\n\nIt's not a deal to end a war, but to save and finance Hamas so it can begin the next war.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press -

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nWhite House officials on Monday said Biden's decision to make public what it describes as an Israeli proposal -- just one day after it was delivered to Hamas -- was driven by a desire to put Hamas on the spot. The move diverged from the U.S. administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal -- which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNETANYAHU FACING PRESSURE FROM FAR-RIGHT\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nOPTIMISM DESPITE HEADWINDS\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the U.S. Global Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nEVEN GETTING TO PHASE ONE IS A CHALLENGE\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one -- and the six-week pause in fighting -- would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding

Netanyahu of 'maneuvering under the US cover' just hours after Joe Biden told them 'this deal must get done'.\n\nPresident Joe Biden urged both Israel and Hamas to back his ceasefire roadmap, which he presented on Friday, and called for 'all appropriate measures' to be used to secure the agreement.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian militant group frowns upon Washington and the West's calls for it to accept Biden's proposal on Gaza 'as if it is Hamas who is hampering the deal'.\n\nIn comments reported by Hamas media, Abu Zuhri said Israel is not serious about reaching a deal in Gaza and is still maneuvering under the US' cover.\n\nBiden last night revealed on his POTUS X, formerly Twitter, account that he is working on the ceasefire and hostage deal that will allow the US and its allies to begin working on rebuilding 'homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza to help repair communities destroyed in the chaos of war.\n\n'This deal must get done,' he emphasized.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for both Israel and Hamas to back his Gaza ceasefire roadmap that he presented on Friday\n\nSenior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said the militant group believe Israel is not serious about reaching a ceasefire deal\n\nIn a following post, Biden revealed he had been in conversation with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar to discuss how the ceasefire and hostage deal 'offers a concrete roadmap for ending the crisis in Gaza'.\n\nRead More Father of US Hamas hostage warns Israeli-Gaza conflict has hit 'critical times' as

their tireless efforts to secure the release of all hostages held in Gaza,' he said.\n\n'The United States, together with Egypt and Qatar, will work to ensure the full implementation of this agreement'.\n\nQatar, which has been mediating on the Gaza conflict, has also called for both Israel and Hamas to accept President Joe Biden's ceasefire deal.\n\nQatar said Tuesday it was waiting for a 'clear position' from Israel on a proposed Gaza ceasefire add hostage release deal.\n\n'We are waiting for a clear Israeli position that represents the entire government in response to the US's Gaza proposal,' said Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari.\n\n'The ceasefire deal should immediately end the long suffering of all people in Gaza and the hostages and their families and provide a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the crisis.\n\n'We have read and seen the contradictory statements coming in from Israeli ministers, which doesn't give us much confidence of there being a unified position in Israel over this current proposal on the table.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister's Netanyahu's biggest coalition partner, Shas, said it would also lend 'full support' for a prospective deal to free hostages from Hamas captivity\n\nPalestinians inspect a vehicle hit in an Israeli strike, amid Israel-Hamas conflict, in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza

sides on proposals on the table'.\n\nQatar said that it is still waiting to reach language that is agreed by both parties.\n\nRead More Far-right Israeli ministers threaten to COLLAPSE Netanyahu's

of Israeli government to bolt the coalition if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approves a hostage and truce deal presented by Biden.\n\n'I told the representatives of the kidnapped families today that our position is that there is nothing greater than the value of life and the mitzvah of ransoming captives, because there is a real and tangible danger to their lives,' United Torah Judaism chairman Yitzhak Goldknopf posted on X, alongside a photo of himself meeting relatives of hostages.\n\n'Therefore, we will support any proposal that will lead to the release of the abductees,' added Goldknopf.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Netanyahu's biggest coalition partner said it would also lend 'full support' for a prospective deal to free hostages from Hamas captivity even if that would entails 'far-reaching steps' in Gaza war strategy.\n\nThe statement by Shas, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish party followed open opposition to such a deal by two far-right coalition partners.\n\nIt comes just three days after Netanyahu dismissed the permanent ceasefire proposal as 'a non-starter' despite Biden revealing the plan had originated in Israel.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu (L) speaks with his new Minister of Health and Interior, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party Aryeh Deri, as the new government is sworn in, in Jerusalem on December 29, 2022\n\nThe political leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party Eli Yishai (L) talks to the group's spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (C) during a meeting of the Shas' ruling Council of Torah Sages in Jerusalem 07 July 2000\n\nNetanyahu wrote on X, 'Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: the destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\n\n'Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place.\n\nThe notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.'\n\nBiden on Friday laid out a three-phase ceasefire proposal from Israel to Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to end the war in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe offer calls for a ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nThe US has also urged the UN Security Council to support Biden's three-phase plan.\n\nUS Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 14 other council members to back the proposal for ending the conflict.\n\nRead More San Diego man's father held hostage in Gaza is confirmed dead, as Israel announces four more Hamas victims\n\n'Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,' she said in a statement.\n\nThe brief draft resolution would welcome the May 31 deal announced by Biden and call on Hamas 'to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.' Hamas has said it views the proposal 'positively'.\n\nIt makes no mention of Israeli acceptance of the deal.\n\nWhen Biden made the announcement he called it an Israeli offer that includes an 'enduring ceasefire' and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages it is holding.\n\nIt comes after four more hostages held in Gaza since the deadly October 7 massacre in southern Israel were confirmed dead on Monday.\n\nNadav Popplewell, 51, Yoram Metzger, 80, Amiram Cooper, 84, and Chaim Peri, 79, all died several months ago while being held by Hamas in the Khan Younis area, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nIsrael's military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the four men died together when the Israel Defense Forces were operating in Khan Younis earlier this year, though he didn't offer a definitive cause of death.\n\nAmiram Cooper, left, and Chaim Peri, right, were part of the same kibbutz just a mile outside of Gaza before they were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7. They were confirmed dead on Monday\n\nYoram Metzger, 80, and Nadav Popplewell, 51, were also confirmed dead after being held captive in Khan Younis by Hamas since October 7. Israel's military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari didn't confirm how the men died\n\nWe are checking all of the options,' Hagari said. 'There are a lot of questions.'\n\nQatar, with the US and Egypt, has been engaged in months of back-and-forth negotiations over details for a ceasefire and exchange of hostages and prisoners by both sides.\n\nBut with the exception of a seven-day break in the fighting beginning in November that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, a series of in-person mediation efforts have not stopped the fighting.\n\nRead More Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu dismisses President Biden's Gaza ceasefire drive as 'a non-starter'\n\nIn an effort to reinvigorate talks, US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Israel was offering a new three-stage roadmap towards a full ceasefire, including the release of hostages held by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAccording to the US president, Israel's three-stage offer would begin with a six-week phase that would see Israeli forces withdraw from all populated areas of Gaza and an initial hostage-prisoner exchange.\n\nThe parties would then negotiate for a lasting ceasefire, with the truce to continue as long as talks are ongoing.\n\nIn its final phase, the plan would lead to the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory without Hamas in power, Biden said.\n\n'There is momentum internationally, driven by the US... but we need to be very cautious,' Ansari said.\n\n'We are using our leverage as a mediator...to make sure that both sides understand the gravity of the situation and the need to reach an agreement.'\n\nNegotiations ground to a halt in early May as Israel began ground operations in Rafah in southern Gaza.\n\nPrevious frameworks presented by mediators have run aground over Hamas's demand that any truce lead to a permanent ceasefire, while Israel has said it must be allowed to pursue its war aim of destroying the Palestinian militant group.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A proposal presented by President Joe Biden on Friday for a permanent cease-fire was only part of the package and there were details he didn't make public, Netanyahu said, without being more specific.\n\nIsrael is working on \"countless ways\" to bring back hostages held by Hamas since the start of the near eight-month war, the prime minister said in a separate statement. Ensuring their safe passage back from Gaza would be possible while also eliminating the Iran-backed group, he said.\n\nHis comments raise further questions about the three-phase peace plan laid out by Biden, which he said had been put forward by Israel.

Doubts Grow Over Gaza Truce Plan", "body": "Biden on Friday presented what he labelled an Israeli three-phase plan that would end the bloody conflict, free all hostages and lead to the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory without Hamas in power.\n\nIsrael's military announced the deaths in Gaza of four hostages seized on October 7.\n\nJerusalem:\n\nIsrael on Monday announced the deaths of four captives held in Gaza amid growing doubts and international pressure over a plan for a ceasefire and hostage release deal outlined by US President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden on Friday presented what he labelled an Israeli three-phase plan that would end the bloody conflict, free all hostages and lead to the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory without Hamas in power.\n\nHowever, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stressed that the war sparked by the October 7 attack would continue until all of Israel's \"goals are achieved\", including the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities.\n\nAnd on Monday, the White House said Biden told the emir of mediator Qatar that he saw Hamas as \"the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\" in Gaza, and urged him to press the group to accept it.\n\nThe G7 group of developed countries said in a statement its leaders \"fully endorse\" the deal pushed by Biden, and called on Hamas to accept it.\n\nIsrael's military announced the deaths in Gaza of four hostages seized on October 7, naming them as Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popplewell.\n\nBritish foreign minister David Cameron said he was \"greatly saddened to hear about the death\" of Israeli-British Popplewell, adding: \"we reiterate our demand for Hamas to send all hostages home\".\n\nAll but Popplewell were seen alive in a video released by Hamas in December.\n\nSeparately, Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said: \"We assess that the four of them were killed while together in the area of Khan Yunis during our operation there against Hamas.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, the army said it had located in Israel the body of paramedic Dolev Yehud, who had been thought to be a hostage but was killed on October 7.\n\nIsraeli media have questioned to what extent Biden's ceasefire speech and some crucial details were coordinated with Netanyahu's team, including how long any truce would hold and how many captives would be freed and when.\n\nHamas on Friday said it viewed Biden's outline \"positively\", but has since made no official comment on the stalled negotiations, while mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have not announced any new talks.\n\n- 'End to suffering' -\n\nForeign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Egypt issued a statement on Monday backing the latest diplomatic effort.\n\nThey \"emphasised the importance of dealing seriously and positively with the US president's proposal\", which could produce \"a permanent ceasefire... and an end to the suffering of the people of the Gaza Strip\", the joint statement said.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer quoted Netanyahu as saying that the outline Biden presented was only \"partial\", and that under the plan fighting would only stop temporarily \"for the purpose of returning the hostages\".\n\nHowever, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Monday said the White House has \"seen again over the weekend from Israel a willingness to step forward and do a deal\".\n\nAnd State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the proposal was \"nearly identical\" to one submitted several weeks ago by Hamas and called on its leader, Yahya Sinwar, not to \"move the goalposts\".\n\nThe fighting showed no sign of easing, with the war that has devastated the coastal territory of 2.4 million people soon to enter its ninth month.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military said its forces had struck \"over 50 targets\" over the past day, and Gaza hospitals reported at least 19 fatalities in overnight strikes.\n\n- Heavy fighting -\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,470 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of all structures in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\nHeavy fighting has raged especially in Gaza's far-southern Rafah area near the Egyptian border, where UN agencies say most civilians have now been displaced once more.\n\nIsrael's military said troops were carrying out \"targeted operations in the Rafah area\", and witnesses reported air strikes and shelling.\n\nGaza's European hospital said 10 people were killed in an air strike on a house near the main southern city of Khan Yunis, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital reported six dead in a strike on a home in the central Bureij refugee camp.\n\nUN and other aid agencies have warned for months of the looming risk of famine in the besieged territory amid a spiralling humanitarian crisis.\n\n- Political pressure -\n\nNetanyahu, a hawkish veteran leading a fragile hard-right coalition government, is under intense domestic pressure from multiple sides.\n\nRelatives and supporters of hostages have staged mass protests demanding a truce deal -- but his far-right coalition allies are threatening to bring down the government if he agrees to that.\n\nIn a video message on Monday, Netanyahu insisted Israel would achieve \"both tasks\" in its war: \"the elimination of Hamas\" and the return of the captives.\n\nAccording to Biden, Israel's three-stage offer would begin with a six-week phase that would see Israeli forces withdraw from all populated areas of Gaza and an initial hostage-prisoner exchange.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nBoth sides would then negotiate for a lasting ceasefire, with the truce to continue as long as talks are ongoing, Biden said.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"},

hostages confirmed dead inside war-torn Gaza as Western and Middle East powers threw their support behind a truce deal outlined by US President Joe Biden.\n\nWashington said it would seek a UN Security Council resolution to back the three-phase plan which was welcomed by the Group of Seven developed countries and by leading regional governments.\n\nUnder the proposal which Biden presented last Friday as Israel's plan, fighting would stop for an initial six weeks and hostages would be swapped for Palestinian prisoners, ahead of the start of the rebuilding of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has however stressed since that fighting would only have to cease temporarily to free the captives, and that one of Israel's key war aims remains the destruction of Hamas.\n\nThe White House insisted Monday that the plan was Israel's own and not drafted by Washington to put pressure on its key ally.\n\n\"It is an Israeli proposal,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. \"It's one that we, and they, worked on through some intense diplomacy.\"\n\nALSO READ: Man accused of attacking KZN family over Palestine support to undergo mental

comment.\n\nThe group has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza in months of intermittent talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nFor now, the Gaza war raged on unabated, with the Israeli military reporting more air and artillery strikes and ground combat against Hamas, and Palestinians bemoaning more civilian deaths.\n\nOvernight bombardment hit targets in Gaza City and the southern Rafah area, said AFP reporters and witnesses.\n\nFour bodies were retrieved from a bombed house in the Bureij camp in central Gaza, and three more from the rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City, Gaza's civil defence agency said.\n\nThe Israeli military had on Monday confirmed another four deaths among the more than 250 captives taken by Hamas during their unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nALSO READ: Palestinian authorities seek to join South Africa case at top UN court\n\nIt named them as Nadav Popplewell, 51, and three men in their 80s, Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger and Amiram Cooper, and said their bodies were still in the hands of Hamas.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said it was believed the four \"were killed while together in the area of Khan Yunis during our operation there against Hamas\".\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum group, which has joined a series of mass protests demanding a truce deal, said the men \"should have returned alive to their country and their families\".\n\nProtesters in Tel Aviv on Saturday waved US flags and declared that -- as the Gaza war is soon to enter its ninth month -- \"Biden is our only hope\".\n\n'No alternative'\n\nWashington unveiled a draft UN Security Council resolution on Monday that \"welcomes the new deal...

the region, have endorsed this plan\".\n\nALSO READ: Chile joins SA against Israel at UN court\n\nBiden told Qatar's emir that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\" and \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward\" with the terms he set out last week.\n\nThe truce plan also drew the full endorsement of the other leaders of the G7 which also includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\nThey said it would also bring \"a significant and sustained increase in humanitarian assistance for distribution throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel's security interests and Gazan civilian safety assured\".\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 statement added.\n\nThe effort was also supported by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Egypt, said a joint statement by their foreign ministers.\n\nUN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland also urged both sides to back the deal, writing on X that \"there is no alternative -- and any delay, every day simply costs more lives\".\n\nALSO READ: Rafah battles intensify as Israel takes over Gaza-Egypt border strip\n\nBlazing wildfires\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the

dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,550 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, 294 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza military campaign since the start of the ground offensive on October 27.\n\nSome 55 percent of Gaza's structures have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\nAmid the Gaza war, tensions have also spiralled elsewhere in the region between Israel and its allies on the one hand, and Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen on the other.\n\nALSO READ: WATCH: South Africa condemns Israeli attack on Rafah camp\n\nThe

'Now. Hamas needs to accept it.'\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that a three-phase deal proposed by Israel to Hamas on a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip is the \"best chance\" to stop hostilities in the Palestinian enclave.\n\n\"This deal, what's on the table right now, is the best chance to get all the hostages out and to get a path to permanent cessation of hostilities,\" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters.\n\n\"Coming out of phase two, Hamas will accept the deal. And as you get that, then you can talk about really advancing a vision for post-war Gaza and what that needs to look like,\" he said. \"And if you can get that, then you can really start to get some momentum towards other goals we have in the region like normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia and of course, all of that can help build to an eventual two-state solution which the president believes, unlike some people, he believes that it still is best achieved through direct negotiations between the parties.\"\n\nThe spokesperson reiterated that the US will continue to support Israel in its efforts to eliminate the threat by Hamas.\n\n\"We're going to continue to work with the prime minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) and the War Cabinet to try to get this over the finish line. A proposal, I would add that was an Israeli proposal that they crafted after some diplomatic conversations with us, and which they've acknowledged is their proposal,\" he added.\n\nKirby said. \"It was a big effort by Israel to put this proposal on the table. We're grateful for that good faith effort. Now, Hamas needs to accept it.\"\n\nThe proposal, as laid out by Biden last Friday, envisions a three-phase agreement that would culminate with a multi-year process to rebuild the badly damaged coastal enclave and the return of all hostages, living and dead, held in Gaza.\n\nThe first phase would start with a six-week cease-fire, during which a first round of hostages held in Gaza would be released, including women, the elderly and the injured, in exchange for the release of what Biden said would be \"hundreds\" of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would also withdraw from what a senior Biden administration official called \"densely populated areas.\"\n\nThe remains of some hostages who have died would also be returned, and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes and neighborhoods throughout Gaza, including the north, where Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions. Humanitarian aid deliveries would also scale up dramatically to reach 600 trucks per day, according to Biden.\n\nNegotiators would seek to address outstanding issues during the six-week first phase, including the ratio of Palestinian prisoners that would be freed in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages. The proposal includes language allowing the cease-fire to be extended before the second phase begins, as long as talks continue.\n\nThe prisoner swap ratio is a critical issue because in the second phase, all living hostages would be freed, including all male Israeli military personnel. Israel's forces would also fully withdraw from Gaza.\n\nThe final phase includes the commencement of Gaza's reconstruction, which is estimated to take up to five years, and the return of any additional remains of hostages held in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has continued its brutal offensive on Gaza following a cross-border attack on Oct. 7 by the Palestinian resistance group, Hamas, despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nMore than 36,400 Palestinians have since been killed in the enclave, the vast majority being women and children, and over 82,600 others injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nNearly eight months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael is accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in its latest ruling ordered it to immediately halt its operation in the southern city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [],

In fact, the two combatants are as far apart from an armistice as ever. There has been an uptick in political pressure for a settlement -- possibly significant, certainly intriguing, but nothing that signals the war in Gaza is nearly over.\n\nHopes were raised on Friday when Biden gave a speech revealing that Israel had drafted -- and submitted to the peace talks in Cairo -- \"a comprehensive new proposal ... a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages.\"\n\nThe remarkable thing was that Biden not only publicly disclosed the proposal but endorsed it, thus sharing the stakes and risks of its success or failure. He delivered the speech after sunset and thus the start of the Sabbath in Israel, ensuring that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wouldn't respond immediately. Soon enough, though, Netanyahu pushed back against Biden's speech, saying the American president had mischaracterized his proposal -- that Israel's war aims, and its determination to keep fighting until Hamas' political and military capabilities were destroyed, hadn't changed.\n\nBiden described the proposal as having three phrases. Phase 1 would entail a complete cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli troops from all populated areas in Gaza, the return of Gazan citizens to their homes, the rollout of much more humanitarian aid, and the release of a number of hostages -- including women, the elderly, and the wounded -- in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nIn Phase 2, all remaining hostages would be released, and as long as Hamas lived up to its commitments, the temporary cease-fire would become, in the words of the proposal, \"the cessation of hostilities permanently.\" In Phase 3, the reconstruction of Gaza would commence.\n\nTwo things were striking about Biden's summary. First, it didn't seem new; variations on this three-phase plan -- cease-fire, hostage exchange, reconstruction, and settlement of the ancient Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- have been on the table for quite a while now. Second, though some commentators have presented the proposal as if all the blanks were filled and all that's left is the handshaking ceremony, Biden himself said nothing of the sort.\n\nIn fact, after describing Phase 1, Biden said, \"Now I'll be straight with you. There are a number of details to negotiate to move from Phase 1 to Phase 2. Israel will want to make sure its interests are protected.\" As for Phase 3 (the reconstruction), no details are yet set.\n\nIn his response, Netanyahu emphasized that, as far as he is concerned, neither Phase 2 nor Phase 3 will happen until \"the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities\" -- even if this meant Israel kept having to fight the war. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made the same point to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. But the fact is, Biden never said the proposal suggests otherwise; this is one of the issues that still needs to be worked out.\n\nIt's hardly a minor detail. Hamas' position is that it won't release all the hostages until after Israel has withdrawn all its troops and a permanent cease-fire is in place. In this sense -- in the ultimate sense -- Israel and Hamas are at loggerheads; their positions, which stem from what they see as their interests, seem irreconcilable.\n\nThe peace talks (which diplomats from the U.S., Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia have sincerely been trying to advance) are stalled. The war is increasingly ruinous (to Gaza, the Palestinian people, Israel's international reputation, and Biden's reelection prospects). Netanyahu's war aim -- \"total victory\" over Hamas -- is, as a practical matter, unachievable (according to U.S. intelligence and several Israeli officers). Israel did put a new proposal on the table, even if the contents weren't so new.\n\nAs David Horovitz, columnist for the Times of Israel put it on Monday, Biden's \"game plan\" might simply be \"let's get phase one moving,\" with a vague \"hope that the start of the process could itself yield further benefits.\" This may be \"a long shot,\" but \"maybe that's all the American administration feels it has right now.\"\n\nBiden did put forth one new rhetorical gambit. \"Total victory,\" as Netanyahu has prescribed, may be not only unachievable but unnecessary. \"The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security,\" Biden said, \"because they've devastated Hamas forces over the past eight months. At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7\" -- and that has been \"Israel's main objective in this war and, quite frankly, a righteous one.\"\n\nHe added, \"We can't lose this moment. Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of 'total victory' will only bog down Israel in Gaza, draining the economic, military, and human resources and furthering Israel's isolation in the world.\" It \"will not bring hostages home\" or \"bring an enduring defeat of Hamas\" or \"bring Israel lasting security.\"\n\nTake a chance, he was urging Israel's leaders and its people. If things go south, America will still be with you, will continue providing for your defense; and if Hamas doesn't pull its end of the bargain, then the whole deal is off anyway. Biden made this final point very clear, putting the onus on Hamas, which started this war with its surprise invasion, killing 1,200 Israelis, most of them civilians. \"Israel has made their proposal,\" Biden stated. \"Hamas says it wants a cease-fire; this deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it. Hamas needs to take the deal.\"\n\nOn Monday, Biden called the emir of Qatar -- who has long been an intermediary between Hamas and the rest of the world -- urging him to pressure Hamas to take this deal, saying that Israel is prepared to commence Phase 1 immediately if Hamas says yes.\n\nOf course, Biden knows the onus is also on Israel, certainly for any steps beyond Phase 1, and the speech is already having some effects on Israeli politics. Netanyahu's leading far-right coalition partner, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to quit the government if some reports about Israel's proposal -- especially those saying it calls for a permanent cease-fire without first destroying Hamas -- proved true. In a speech to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Ben-Gvir said he'd asked to see the written draft of Israel's proposal but Netanyahu wouldn't show it to him, leading him to wonder if the prime minister was engaged in a \"whitewash\" of his true intentions.\n\nIf Ben-Gvir and his far-right colleagues did quit, Netanyahu's governing coalition would lose its majority in the Knesset -- a fact that would trigger new elections, which Netanyahu would likely lose. Netanyahu issued a particularly forceful response to Biden's speech, in part to rein in Ben-Gvir's loyalty.\n\nYair Lapid, the leader of Israel's opposition movement, said he would buoy up Netanyahu's position, providing him a \"political safety net,\" if he supported a permanent cease-fire and lost Ben-Gvir's faction as a result. But it is doubtful that Netanyahu would believe the promise or want to lead a government that had Lapid as a pivotal member. Nor is it clear -- and this is the question -- whether Netanyahu himself supports anything like the three-phase solution, with or without his far-right partners.\n\nMeanwhile, there are some reports (of who knows what reliability) that Qatar is stepping up pressure on Hamas to take a deal. As the war rages on, tensions have resurfaced between Israel and Egypt, including brief fighting along the Gazan border, threatening the survival of their half-century-old peace treaty -- which both countries have a vital interest in protecting. Saudi Arabia very much wants to resume its \"normalization\" with Israel -- for its economic benefits, for its potent alliance against the common enemy of Iran, and for security guarantees that the United States has held out as a side benefit -- and it is very much in Israel's interest to get those talks on track as well. It can't happen, though, until the war is over. Everyone involved in this war has a choice to make. Netanyahu's is particularly huge: whether he values his career over his country's security, and whether he can see a way to redefine his career -- reset his political coalition -- in the interests of national security.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_kaplan@slate.com", "name": "Fred Kaplan", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nWhite House officials on Monday said Biden's decision to make public what it describes as an Israeli proposal -- just one day after it was delivered to Hamas -- was driven by a desire to put Hamas on the spot. The move diverged from the U.S. administration's position throughout the conflict to allow the Israelis to speak for themselves about hostage negotiations.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The president felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here and catalyze a different outcome,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nAlmost immediately after Biden detailed the proposal -- which includes a cease-fire and phased Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all hostages -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it would continue its war until Hamas was destroyed.\n\nNETANYAHU FACING PRESSURE FROM FAR-RIGHT\n\nNetanyahu's political survival depends on a far-right coalition that is adamant about eradicating Hamas. He sowed further doubt about proposal's viability Monday when he told an Israeli parliament committee that there are certain \"gaps\" in how Biden laid out the proposal. The prime minister said Israelis \"reserve the right to return to war.\"\n\nKirby played down differences between Biden and Netanyahu and underscored that the proposal was an Israeli one. He added that Biden agrees with Israelis that Hamas should not govern postwar Gaza nor does he \"expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister, the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal. It shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut even if Hamas agreed to terms, it would require Netanyahu to make some difficult political calculations. Two leading members of his far-right coalition -- National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- have threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he signs off on the proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nNetanyahu has also faced pressure from families of hostages -- officials say about 80 people captured by militants i n the Oct. 7 attack are still alive and Hamas is holding the bodies of 43 others -- to reach an agreement to free their loved ones. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, vowed over the weekend to provide a political safety net to Netanyahu, ensuring his government would not fall over the deal.\n\nOPTIMISM DESPITE HEADWINDS\n\nEven as the proposal faces stiff headwinds, the Biden administration said it was cautiously optimistic that a deal could be reached.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"They need to train their eyes on Hamas this week and say it's time to come to the table to do this deal,\" Sullivan said in an appearance at the U.S. Global Leadership Conference in Washington.\n\nTo that end, Biden on Monday spoke with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, a key Hamas interlocutor, and said it was \"the best possible opportunity for an agreement,\" the White House said.\n\nSullivan, meanwhile, spoke to his Turkish counterpart, Akif Cagatay Kilic, about Turkey using its influence with Hamas to get them to accept the proposal. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas and hosted the group's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for talks in April.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders on Monday also endorsed the deal.\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 leaders said in a statement.\n\nEVEN GETTING TO PHASE ONE IS A CHALLENGE\n\nBiden acknowledged last week that getting beyond the first phase of the proposal would be difficult.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe first phase would last for six weeks and would include a cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza and the release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Israelis, under the proposal, would also allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza each day during the first phase. The second phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nHamas is likely to make enormous demands about which Palestinian prisoners will be released and call on Israel to assure that it won't continue to target top Hamas leaders.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East peace negotiator, said even getting to phase one -- and the six-week pause in fighting -- would bring about a \"downshift in the escalation of the military campaign, fewer people dying.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure they can expect much more,\" said Miller, now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Negotiations work in the end only if the parties feel sufficient pain accompanied by the prospects of gain, and that generates urgency. The only party that is in a hurry here is the Biden administration.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIndeed, Israeli officials view the conflict on a far longer timeline.\n\nJust last week, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said he expected the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nBut with Election Day in the U.S. now just over five months away, Biden faces tightening pressure to more quickly resolve the Mideast conflict that's left him bleeding support.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

The State Department admitted Monday that its plan was \"virtually identical\" to Hamas's own proposals, and deliberately so, in order to entice Hamas to accept the deal.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disputed the claim that the proposal reflected Israel's position. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer reiterated to reporters on Tuesday: \"We will not leave Hamas in power so that they can repeat their rocket fire and the October 7th massacre.\"\n\nStill, the U.S. claims Israel is on board with the deal. And on Monday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced a new U.S. resolution:\n\nToday, the United States circulated a new U.S. draft Security Council Resolution supporting the proposal now on the table to end the fighting in Gaza through a ceasefire and hostage deal. Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions.\n\nSwift implementation of this deal would enable\u202fan immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas in its first phase, an immediate surge in humanitarian assistance and restoration of basic services, the return of\u202fPalestinian civilians to northern Gaza, together with a roadmap for ending the crisis altogether and a multi-year internationally backed reconstruction plan.\n\nUltimately, it would lead to an end of the war in a manner that ensures Israel's security and brings immediate relief to the civilians of Gaza.\n\nThe Security Council must insist that Hamas accept the deal. Members of the Council have consistently called for the steps outlined in this deal: bringing the hostages home, ensuring a complete ceasefire, enabling a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and in the refurbishment of essential services, and setting the stage for a long-term reconstruction plan for Gaza. Council Members should not let this opportunity to pass by. We must speak with one voice in support of this deal.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that the resolution could receive a vote as soon as this week, though it is not clear how a United Nations Security Council resolution would pressure Hamas, which ignores international pressure already. The resolution would likely be non-binding and merely advisory in nature. It is unclear whether the resolution wil pass.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel faces growing threats on its northern border, with Iran-backed Hezbollah in southern Lebanon firing rockets at Israel that have caused major fires across the north. \"No one should doubt Israel's ability to fight the threats against us,\" Mencer said, hinting at future action against Hezbollah, calling the war a \"seven-fronted war.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

It freed 105 during a week-long truce last November.\n\nIsrael's indiscriminate war on Gaza which began on October 7 has devastated the territory and killed at least 36,550 Palestinians, mostly women and children.\n\nThe dead hostages were identified by the Israeli military as Chaim Peri, 79, Amiram Cooper, 84, Yoram Metzger, 80, and Nadav Popplewell, 51.\n\n\"Haim, Yoram, Amiram and Nadav were kidnapped alive, some of them were with other hostages who returned in the previous deal, and they should have come home alive to their country and their families,\" the statement said.\n\nIt pointed out that the four hostages were seen alive in Hamas videos after October 7 and called on the Israeli government to immediately accept a deal proposed by US President Joe Biden on Friday which would see remaining Israeli captives released and Israeli troops withdraw from the Gaza Strip.\n\nContinued disputes over deal\n\nWhile Biden initially said that the deal was proposed by Israel, the Netanyahu government has not endorsed it with extreme-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich threatening to bring down the government if the deal goes through.\n\nThe two extremist leaders have said that the deal would end the war in Gaza without achieving Israel's proclaimed war aim of |\"destroying Hamas\".\n\nSince Biden announced the deal, Netanyahu has said that there would be \"no permanent ceasefire\" in Gaza before the destruction of Hamas.\n\nWhile Hamas has already said that it viewed Biden's proposal \"positively\", US officials claim that it has not yet accepted the deal.\n\nQatari mediation continues\n\nOn Monday, Biden spoke with Qatar Emir Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani, whose government has been involved in mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas and urged him to secure Hamas's acceptance of the deal.\n\nA White House statement said that Biden had \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas,\" Reuters reported.\n\nQatar on Tuesday stressed that there should be a clear position from both parties to reach a ceasefire deal.\n\n\"We are waiting for a clear Israeli position that represents the entire government in response to the US's Gaza proposal,\" Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari said.\n\n\"The ceasefire deal should immediately end the long-suffering of all people in Gaza and the hostages and their families and provide a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the crisis\", Al-Ansari added.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Biden's version was \"incomplete\" and \"incorrect\" in its characterization of Israeli's conditions, Netanyahu reportedly said.\n\nBut White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the two countries have the same position on the proposal. ''I know of no gaps to speak of,\" he said.\n\n\"We're confident that it accurately reflects that proposal -- a proposal that we worked with the Israelis on.\"\n\nThe disagreement appears to stem from Israel's insistence that its war with Hamas can not end until it has fully destroyed Hamas' military and civil governance capabilities and Biden's assertion that the Israeli military has already devastated Hamas.\n\n\"At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7th, which -- one of the Israelis' main objective in this war and, quite frankly, a righteous one,\" Biden said Friday.\n\nRelated: Israelis ask if world has forgotten their hostages six months after the trauma of Oct. 7\n\nBiden described a three-stage proposal that includes a six-week ceasefire that could become permanent, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, the release by Hamas of an unspecified number of Israeli hostages and the release of Palestinian prisoners in the first phase. American hostages would also be released at that point, Biden said, as would the remains of some hostages who were killed.\n\nThat would allow Palestinian civilians to return to their homes and humanitarian aid to surge, he said.\n\n\"There are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two. Israel will want to make sure its interests are protected,\" Biden said. \"But the proposal says if the negotiations take longer than six weeks for phase one, the ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue.\"\n\nKirby said Monday that the U.S informed Israel that Biden planned to make the remarks before he did. \"The president felt that it was important to lay it out there publicly,\" Kirby said of the proposal.\n\nBiden gave the speech so the \"whole world\" could see what was in the plan, he added. The speech was a departure for the U.S., which has in the past declined to comment on the specific details of cease-fire proposals. Biden took this approach, Kirby said, because of how long the hostages have been held and because Hamas has reneged in the past on proposals.\n\nThe timing of Biden's remarks were related to the fact that the night before it had been given to Hamas, which the U.S. says Hamas has not officially responded to the proposal.\n\nKirby stressed that the U.S. does not want to see an attack like the one that Hamas carried out on Oct. 7 and does not want to see the militant group control Gaza after the war.\n\n\"We don't have all the answers to all that right now,\" he said. \"Whatever it looks like, it cannot look like it did on the 6th of October.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran hostage crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/L5MH8HcN_nWJlO_sLIZ5hA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/89a9d1e56992bd237e2cc6e848835703", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-06", "textStart": 3266, "textEnd": 3280}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1166, "textEnd": 1177, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

"Israel mourns dead hostages as major powers urge Gaza truce", "body": "Israel on Tuesday mourned four hostages confirmed dead inside war-torn Gaza as Western and Middle East powers threw their support behind a truce deal outlined by US President Joe Biden.\n\nWashington said it would seek a UN Security Council resolution to back the three-phase plan which was welcomed by the Group of Seven developed countries and by leading regional governments.\n\nUnder the proposal which Biden presented last Friday as Israel's plan, fighting would stop for an initial six weeks and hostages would be swapped for Palestinian prisoners, ahead of the start of the rebuilding of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has however stressed since that fighting would only have to cease temporarily to free the captives, and that one of Israel's key war aims remains the destruction of Hamas.\n\nThe White House insisted Monday that the plan was Israel's own and not drafted by Washington to put pressure on its key ally.\n\n\"It is an Israeli proposal,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. \"It's one that we, and they, worked on through some intense diplomacy.\"\n\nHamas, the Islamist group that has long ruled the Palestinian territory of 2.4 million people, said Friday it viewed Biden's outline \"positively\" but has since made no official comment.\n\nThe group has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza in months of intermittent talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nFor now, the Gaza war raged on unabated, with the Israeli military reporting more air and artillery strikes and ground combat against Hamas, and Palestinians bemoaning more civilian deaths.\n\nOvernight bombardment hit targets in Gaza City and the southern Rafah area, said AFP reporters and witnesses.\n\nFour bodies were retrieved from a bombed house in the Bureij camp in central Gaza, and three more from the rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City, Gaza's civil defence agency said.\n\nThe Israeli military had on Monday confirmed another four deaths among the more than 250 captives taken by Hamas during their unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nIt named them as Nadav Popplewell, 51, and three men in their 80s, Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger and Amiram Cooper, and said their bodies were still in the hands of Hamas.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said it was believed the four \"were killed while together in the area of Khan Yunis during our operation there against Hamas\".\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum group, which has joined a series of mass protests demanding a truce deal, said the men \"should have returned alive to their country and their families\".\n\nProtesters in Tel Aviv on Saturday waved US flags and declared that -- as the Gaza war is soon to enter its ninth month -- \"Biden is our only hope\".\n\n- 'No alternative' -\n\nWashington unveiled a draft UN Security Council resolution on Monday that \"welcomes the new deal... and calls upon Hamas to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition\".\n\nMore from this section Sad-looking rejected dog is now unrecognizable The Oilers' long road to the Stanley Cup final Senior figures in Reform 'BLINDSIDED' by Nigel Farage's shock announcement\n\nUS ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said \"numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan\".\n\nBiden told Qatar's emir that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\" and \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward\" with the terms he set out last week.\n\nThe truce plan also drew the full endorsement of the other leaders of the G7 which also includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\nThey said it would also bring \"a significant and sustained increase in humanitarian assistance for distribution throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel's security interests and Gazan civilian safety assured\".\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 statement added.\n\nThe effort was also supported by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Egypt, said a joint statement by their foreign ministers.\n\nUN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland also urged both sides to back the deal, writing on X that \"there is no alternative -- and any delay, every day simply costs more lives\".\n\n- Blazing wildfires -\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,550 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, 294 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza military campaign since the start of the ground offensive on October 27.\n\nSome 55 percent of Gaza's structures have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\nAmid the Gaza war, tensions have also spiralled elsewhere in the region between Israel and its allies on the one hand, and Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen on the other.\n\nThe Israeli army and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement have traded near daily cross-border fire, causing deaths and forcing mass evacuations on both sides.\n\nAs temperatures have soared, rocket strikes from Lebanon have ignited fires that have swept across scrub and farm land and forced the partial evacuation of the northeastern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona.\n\nburs-jd/fz/kir", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Militants also took some 250 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. At least 36,479 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, have been killed in Gaza in Israeli bombardments and ground offensive since October 7, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory.\n\nThe United States on Monday announced a draft Security Council resolution supporting the Israel-Hamas ceasefire plan outlined by Joe Biden last week, urging Hamas to accept it.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan,\" said US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\n\nThe draft text, seen by AFP, \"welcomes the new deal announced on May 31, and calls upon Hamas to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\"\n\nBiden outlined on Friday what he called an Israeli plan that in three phases would end the bloody conflict, free all hostages and lead to the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory without Hamas in power.\n\nHowever fissures between the two allies emerged when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stressed that the ongoing war in Gaza would continue until all of Israel's \"goals are achieved,\" including the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities.\n\nIsraeli media have questioned to what extent Biden's ceasefire speech and some crucial details were coordinated with Netanyahu's team, including how long any truce would hold and how many captives would be freed and when.\n\nEarlier Monday, the White House said Biden told the emir of mediator Qatar that he saw Hamas as \"the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\" in Gaza, and urged him to press the group to accept it.\n\nHamas last week said it viewed Biden's outline \"positively,\" but has since made no official comment on the stalled negotiations, while mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have not announced any new talks.\n\nBefore Biden had made his Friday announcement, Algeria had last week circulated a draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and a halt of the Israeli offensive on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, citing the recent order to that effect from the International Court of Justice.\n\nWashington at the time had said that the text wouldn't be helpful, saying instead direct, on-the-ground negotiations were necessary for a truce.\n\nNo vote is scheduled for either draft resolution.\n\nThe council has struggled to find a unified voice since the war broke out with the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, followed by Israel's retaliatory campaign.\n\nAfter passing two resolutions centered on the need for humanitarian aid to people in Gaza, in March the council passed a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire -- an appeal that had been blocked several times before by the United States.", "source": {"uri": "seychellesnewsagency.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Seychelles News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org",

Egypt's foreign minister urged Israel and Hamas on Monday to accept the cease-fire plan, telling reporters: \"Hamas's initial statements indicate that it received the deal proposal positively, and we are waiting for the Israeli response,\" Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said.\n\nThe proposal, which the White House has called an Israeli proposal, has divided public opinion in Israel, where more than 100,000 people filled the streets of Tel Aviv this past weekend in support of the deal, demanding that the Israeli government accept it to hasten the release of hostages held in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu said in a separate statement Monday that he was \"working in countless ways to return our hostages,\" adding, \"I think about them constantly, about their families and about their suffering.\" But he underscored that the \"elimination of Hamas,\" remained a primary focus.\n\nThe Israeli military on Monday confirmed that four more hostages were killed several months ago in Hamas custody. The four were \"killed while together in the area of Khan Younis during our operation there against Hamas,\" Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a Monday briefing. The IDF notified the families Monday.\n\nThe news increases the pressure on Netanyahu to seek a deal that will bring the remaining hostages back home.\n\n\"Chaim (Peri, 80), Yoram (Metzger, 80), Amiram (Cooper, 84), and Nadav (Popplewell, 51) were kidnapped alive, some of them were with other hostages who returned in the previous deal -- and they should have returned alive to their country and their families!\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.\n\nThe cease-fire proposal has already divided his fragile war cabinet after far-right members of the coalition threatened to quit and bring down the government if the deal is accepted.\n\nUltranationalist minister Bezalel Smotrich called the proposal \"dangerous\" on Monday and said it would \"humiliate the State of Israel.\" He reiterated that he and others would stand down and \"work to replace the failed leadership with a new one,\" should it be accepted.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid, however, has said that he would provide backing to Netanyahu's government to keep it from collapsing if it accepts the deal.\n\n\"The Israeli government must agree to the Netanyahu proposal and send a delegation to Cairo today to finalize the details,\" he said. \"I am repeating my offer to give Netanyahu a political safety net to carry out the deal.\"\n\nNetanyahu has also accused the United States of presenting only a \"partial\" view of the cease-fire plan.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday there were no \"gaps,\" in the proposal. \"We're confident that [Biden's speech] accurately reflects that proposal -- a proposal that we worked with the Israelis on, so I know of no gaps to speak of,\" he added.\n\nThe White House has described the proposal as including a six-week halt in fighting, during which hostages taken from Israel during Hamas's blitz on Oct. 7 would be released in phases in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. There would also be a significant increase in aid shipments allowed into the Gaza Strip, where aid organizations have warned that a humanitarian crisis is underway.\n\nThe main point of contention for this and past proposals, however, remains how and when the war will officially end. Israel insists on the complete destruction of Hamas. Hamas says it wants a permanent cease-fire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a Netanyahu rival within his own party, spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday night and said Israel envisions creating an alternative to Hamas to run Gaza. \"Putting a governmental alternative to Hamas will help to bring them home,\" Gallant said in a statement issued by the Defense Ministry.\n\nHe told Blinken the security establishment is promoting measures to dismantle Hamas's role as the governing and military authority in Gaza and enable the establishment of an alternative power that would overthrow Hamas rule and exert pressure to return hostages.\n\nThe U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which aids Palestinian refugees, said Monday that more than 1 million Palestinians have fled from Rafah since Israeli ground operations started last month and that most are sheltering in the ruins of the city of Khan Younis. \"Conditions are unspeakable,\" the agency said on X. The United Nations also said Monday that more than half of the total buildings in Gaza -- about 137,297 structures -- had been destroyed or damaged by the war so far.\n\n- A group of U.N. experts are calling on more nations to formally recognize the state of Palestine. \"This recognition is an important acknowledgment of the rights of the Palestinian people and their struggles and suffering toward freedom and independence,\" the experts said in a joint statement Monday. Among the signatories is Francesca Albanese, U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in occupied Palestinian territories. The letter follows the recognition from Spain, Ireland and Norway in recent weeks.\n\n- The Israeli military and fire and rescue services are fighting fires started in northern Israel by rocket fire from Lebanon. The fires have spread amid a heat wave in the region. The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that \"no human life is at risk\" as a result of the blaze. Some Israeli politicians, including opposition leader Yair Lapid, said the fires were evidence that the current government was mismanaging national affairs.\n\n- The Maldives will impose a ban on Israeli passport holders entering the country, the president's office announced following a recommendation from the cabinet. The president will appoint a special envoy \"to assess Palestinian needs\" and set up a fundraising campaign to \"assist our brothers and sisters in Palestine\" with the help of UNRWA.\n\n- The IDF said it identified the body of Dolev Yehud, 35, a paramedic who left his house on Oct. 7 \"in an attempt to save lives.\" His body was found in Kibbutz Nir Oz, and his family was notified after it was identified by medical officials. Hagari confirmed his death along with the four hostages he announced had been killed several months ago in the Khan Younis area. The prime minister's office said the number of hostages still being held in Gaza has been updated to 124, of which at least 39 have been declared dead. These figures include four Israelis held for a decade: two of them soldiers confirmed dead and the two other civilians whose fates are unknown.\n\n- At least 20 people were killed in three overnight strikes that hit central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, Gaza's civil defense spokesman said. The IDF said Monday it is continuing operations in Rafah and the central Gaza Strip.\n\n- At least 36,479 people have been killed and 82,777 injured in Gaza since the war started, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 293 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operations in Gaza.\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Without this, we cannot engage in further discussions,\" the official was quoted as saying-\n\nThe Hamas officially reportedly emphasized that Hamas refuses to restart negotiations from the beginning, having already agreed to the previous terms.\n\nIsrael, according to the official, insists on refusing the release of about 200 prisoners with life sentences except under its conditions.\n\nThe leader also expressed surprise at the US administration's insistence on an agreement without Israeli consent, stating, \"We will not consider any proposal unless Israel approves it first.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began efforts to persuade ministers and lawmakers from his Likud Party who oppose the ceasefiRe proposal announced by US President Joe Biden on Friday, Anadolu news agency reported, citing the Israeli public broadcaster KAN.\n\nThe Israeli broadcaster reportedly stated that Netanyahu's actions are in response to threats from National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to bring down the government if he agrees to Biden's proposal.\n\n'A Non-Starter' - Netanyahu Says No Gaza Ceasefire until Hamas 'Destroyed'\n\nKAN highlighted that Netanyahu's discussions with party members reveal concerns about the stability of the ruling coalition with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, leader of the United Torah Judaism Party, along with some Likud ministers, expressed support for the ceasefire proposal. Goldknopf stated he supports any proposal that leads to the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also urged Netanyahu to accept Biden's cease-fire proposal, offering Netanyahu a political safety net to reach the agreement.\n\nIsraeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has accused Netanyahu on Monday of concealing the full details of the latest hostage deal proposal.\n\nAddressing reporters at the Israeli parliament (Knesset), Ben-Gvir said that Netanyahu confirmed that the actual proposal is different from the version presented by Biden and that \"there will be no reckless deal and an end to the war without the collapse of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu, however, reportedly refused to fully disclose the contents of the outline announced by Biden.\n\n'Not Ready' - Netanyahu Says War May Be Paused, Not Stopped\n\n\"I asked him if I could look at the draft of the agreement, and he agreed and said that I could come to his office so that I could see the draft with my own eyes,\" Ben Gvir said, adding that when he arrived on Sunday, the prime minister's assistants told him that \"there is no draft.\"\n\n\"This morning I also went to the Prime Minister's Office, and there, once again, they refused to present the draft agreement to me,\" he said.\n\n\"If the deal is not reckless and does not include a commitment to end the war for Hamas's collapse, why do you refuse to present it to me?\" Ben-Gvir wondered, accusing Netanyahu of \"whitewashing\" the outline.\n\n\"If you sign a reckless deal that will bring an end to the war without the collapse of Hamas, Otzma Yehudit will dissolve the government,\" he stated.\n\nBiden said on Friday that Israel proposed a deal including an initial six-week truce with partial Israeli military withdrawal and the release of some captives while both sides negotiated a \"permanent end to hostilities.\"\n\nHowever, Netanyahu's statement on Saturday dismissed any notion that Israel would agree to a permanent ceasefire before \"the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities,\" calling it \"a non-starter.\"\n\nIsrael's Far-Right Ultimatum - Government Faces Collapse over Gaza Ceasefire\n\nIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid urged Netanyahu to agree to a prisoner exchange deal, pledging his party's support even if right-wing factions in the coalition rebelled, suggesting a deal would likely pass in parliament.\n\n\"The government of Israel cannot ignore President Biden's consequential speech. There is a deal on the table and it should be made,\" Lapid said in a social media post on Saturday.\n\nOn May 6, Hamas politburo chief, Ismail Haniyeh informed the negotiators that Hamas had announced its acceptance of a ceasefire proposal for the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\nHamas later said that the necessary measures \"to ensure the implementation of the agreement were also reviewed after the movement made its decision out of concern for our people and their supreme interests.\"\n\n\"It is now on the occupation to seize the moment and agree to the proposal presented,\" the statement added.\n\nHowever, Israel rejected the deal and decided instead to go ahead with the invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\nCurrently on trial before the International Court of Justice for genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 7.\n\nAccording to Gaza's Ministry of Health, 36,550 Palestinians have been killed, and 82,959 wounded in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7.\n\nMoreover, at least 7,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\nPalestinian and

Blinken tells Israel onus is on Hamas to accept cease-fire deal\n\nThe president's latest engagement builds on calls Secretary of State Antony Blinken held over the weekend with half a dozen foreign ministers of Middle Eastern countries that regularly communicate with Hamas leaders and can exert considerable sway over the group.\n\nHamas leaders issued a statement reacting positively to Biden's address covering the proposal on Friday but have yet to issue any response on the proposal itself, which was transmitted to the group days ago.\n\nWhile the State Department has urged Hamas to take the deal outright, spokesperson Matthew Miller also suggested on Monday that there was still room for compromise.\n\n\"We think this is a serious enough proposal that Hamas should just accept it, but if there need to be further negotiations, we think those all imminently bridgeable -- if, and this is the if -- if Hamas wants a deal,\" he said.\n\nBut across Washington, officials were peppered with questions about Israel's willingness to lay down arms in exchange for the release of scores of hostages held inside Gaza.\n\nMORE: Kirby: US expects Israel to agree to proposal if Hamas does\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby denied that Biden's decision to convey information about the proposed deal was a play to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would abide by the country's commitments.\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister or the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal, how it shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nNetanyahu's conviction was called into question when his office reaffirmed Israel's commitment to ensuring the \"destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel\" before the war ends.\n\n\"Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place,\" an Israeli statement reads. \"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.\"\n\nU.S. officials and the president himself have admitted that the proposed deal contains significant gray areas, particularly in the second and third phases of the agreement which call for \"a permanent end to hostilities\" and \"the major reconstruction of Gaza\" without imposing strict timetables.\n\nMORE: Biden-backed Israel-Hamas cease-fire proposal faces strong headwinds: ANALYSIS\n\nAnalysts say the ambiguity is intentional and that the framework designed to allow both sides to interpret the terms as favorable enough to implement the agreement and gradually ease tension.\n\nHowever, Hamas has spurned any offer that doesn't ensure the group's longtime survival inside Gaza -- and Netanyahu's comments are unlikely to persuade the militants that this proposal is any different.\n\nBrian Katulis, a senior fellow on U.S. foreign policy at the Middle East Institute, argues that this latest chapter of negotiations reflects a change in approach rather than substance.\n\n\"The goal appears to be to spotlight stonewalling by Hamas and right-wing members of the current Israeli government as key roadblocks to a diplomatic settlement,\" Katulis told ABC News.\n\nWhether the strategy ultimately succeeds, he says, will depend on the Biden administration's ability to apply significant, consistent pressure to both sides.\n\n\"For this Biden plan to work will require the U.S. to double down on diplomatic and political efforts in the Middle East, even more so than it already has in the past few months,\" Kautilis said. \"it is not enough to make one-time public statements and expect results.\"\n\nABC News' Fritz Farrow contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

"Israel mourns dead hostages as major powers urge Gaza truce", "body": "Israel on Tuesday mourned four hostages confirmed dead inside war-torn Gaza as Western and Middle East powers threw their support behind a truce deal outlined by US President Joe Biden.\n\nWashington said it would seek a UN Security Council resolution to back the three-phase plan which was welcomed by the Group of Seven developed countries and by leading regional governments.\n\nUnder the proposal which Biden presented last Friday as Israel's plan, fighting would stop for an initial six weeks and hostages would be swapped for Palestinian prisoners, ahead of the start of the rebuilding of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has however stressed since that fighting would only have to cease temporarily to free the captives, and that one of Israel's key war aims remains the destruction of Hamas.\n\nThe White House insisted Monday that the plan was Israel's own and not drafted by Washington to put pressure on its key ally.\n\n\"It is an Israeli proposal,\" said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. \"It's one that we, and they, worked on through some intense diplomacy.\"\n\nHamas, the Islamist group that has long ruled the Palestinian territory of 2.4 million people, said Friday it viewed Biden's outline \"positively\" but has since made no official comment.\n\nThe group has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza in months of intermittent talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nFor now, the Gaza war raged on unabated, with the Israeli military reporting more air and artillery strikes and ground combat against Hamas, and Palestinians bemoaning more civilian deaths.\n\nOvernight bombardment hit targets in Gaza City and the southern Rafah area, said AFP reporters and witnesses.\n\nFour bodies were retrieved from a bombed house in the Bureij camp in central Gaza, and three more from the rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza City, Gaza's civil defence agency said.\n\nThe Israeli military had on Monday confirmed another four deaths among the more than 250 captives taken by Hamas during their unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nIt named them as Nadav Popplewell, 51, and three men in their 80s, Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger and Amiram Cooper, and said their bodies were still in the hands of Hamas.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said it was believed the four \"were killed while together in the area of Khan Yunis during our operation there against Hamas\".\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum group, which has joined a series of mass protests demanding a truce deal, said the men \"should have returned alive to their country and their families\".\n\nProtesters in Tel Aviv on Saturday waved US flags and declared that -- as the Gaza war is soon to enter its ninth month -- \"Biden is our only hope\".\n\n- 'No alternative' -\n\nWashington unveiled a draft UN Security Council resolution on Monday that \"welcomes the new deal... and calls upon Hamas to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition\".\n\nUS ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said \"numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan\".\n\nBiden told Qatar's emir that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\" and \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward\" with the terms he set out last week.\n\nThe truce plan also drew the full endorsement of the other leaders of the G7 which also includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\nThey said it would also bring \"a significant and sustained increase in humanitarian assistance for distribution throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel's security interests and Gazan civilian safety assured\".\n\n\"We call on Hamas to accept this deal, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and we urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so,\" the G7 statement added.\n\nThe effort was also supported by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Egypt, said a joint statement by their foreign ministers.\n\nUN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland also urged both sides to back the deal, writing on X that \"there is no alternative -- and any delay, every day simply costs more lives\".\n\n- Blazing wildfires -\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,550 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, 294 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza military campaign since the start of the ground offensive on October 27.\n\nSome 55 percent of Gaza's structures have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\nAmid the Gaza war, tensions have also spiralled elsewhere in the region between Israel and its allies on the one hand, and Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen on the other.\n\nThe Israeli army and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement have traded near daily cross-border fire, causing deaths and forcing mass evacuations on both sides.\n\nAs temperatures have soared, rocket strikes from Lebanon have ignited fires that have swept across scrub and farm land and forced the partial evacuation of the northeastern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona.\n\nburs-jd/fz/kir\n\nMore from this section\n\nFive Dynamic Divas Building Digital Dynasties Bring the Drama in New Reality Series 'First Ladies of

a ceasefire in the ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza and secures the release of all hostages held by the terrorist group, CNN reported.\n\nEarlier today, the US President held a conversation with the Emir of Qatar and urged him to use all appropriate measures to secure Hamas' acceptance of the deal.\n\nUS President Joe Biden held a conversation with the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to discuss how the ceasefire and hostage deal offer a concrete roadmap for ending the crisis in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Biden, the proposal, transmitted by Qatar to Hamas, outlines a \"roadmap\" towards a ceasefire.\n\nThe initial phase, spanning six weeks, involves a \"full and complete ceasefire with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza\" and \"release of a number of hostages including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\"\n\nThis announcement follows Israel's presentation of new ideas regarding hostage and ceasefire negotiations earlier in the week, a diplomatic source familiar with the negotiations told CNN on Tuesday without divulging details regarding these new ideas.\n\nThis report is

And so it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence. And whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\"\n\nNetanyahu, as Biden referenced, is facing a difficult crossroads at home in which ultranationalist members of his governing coalition are threatening to collapse the government if the current ceasefire proposal, which would secure the release of the hostages over time and phases, is agreed upon and enacted.\n\nBiden's remarks to Time came days before his public announcement of the latest ceasefire proposal, which the United States is optimistic will bring a halt to the war and allow for planning for the complete cessation of the war.\n\nThe three-phase plan would begin with a six-week ceasefire and the return of women, children, and other vulnerable hostages Hamas is holding, the release of \"hundreds\" of Palestinian prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas of Gaza, and the surging of humanitarian aid into the strip for civilians.\n\nThe U.S. and several other countries and international aid workers could more easily and safely get aid to Palestinians during a cessation of fighting. About 200 humanitarian workers have been killed during the conflict, while all of Gaza's 2.2 million residents are facing acute food insecurity.\n\nThe proposal does not include exact details for what the second phase would include, but the plan is that many of these details will be negotiated during the first phase. Though it would include the release of all remaining living Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza \"as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments,\" the president said last week.\n\nBiden's characterization of the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza prompted questions of whether Netanyahu had agreed to a deal that would end the war before they achieved their war objectives.\n\n\"The claims that we have agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met are incorrect,\" Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, according to his office.\n\nOn Monday, Biden spoke with Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani of Qatar, and the president \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas.\" He urged al Thani \"to use all appropriate measures to secure Hamas' acceptance of the deal and affirmed that Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe U.S. is also working on a historic normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, though they view it as a long-term pathway to peace in the region.

At the time, the Biden administration committed to the objective, giving Israel considerable stocks of weaponry and voicing its support.\n\nNearly eight months into the war, however, cracks have emerged between the close allies over what defeating Hamas actually looks like. Last week, US President Joe Biden said the militant group was no longer capable of launching an attack on Israel like the October 7 attack that triggered the war and that it was time for the fighting to end. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right ministers disagree.\n\nWhere the US seeks a quick end to the fighting, Israel's leadership appears determined to push onward.\n\nHere is how the leaders define the destruction of Hamas.\n\nBiden: No ability to pose a threat\n\nBiden on Friday said it was time to end the Israel-Hamas war, signaling that the objective of destroying Hamas had already been met because the militant group was \"no longer capable\" of carrying out a large-scale attack on Israel like the one on October 7.\n\nThat day, Hamas militants astonished Israel with a large-scale assault, killing some 1,200 people and dragging about 250 hostages back to Gaza as rocket fire targeted Israeli cities and towns.\n\nIn the nearly eight months since then, Israel says its air and ground offensive has significantly depleted Hamas' military capabilities. It claims to have killed 15,000 militants, half of Hamas' fighting force, and wounded thousands of others. It also says it has destroyed a significant portion of Gaza's labyrinthine tunnel network, command and control centers and rocket launchers.\n\nBiden appeared Friday to believe this was enough to satisfy Israel's objective. He urged Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement to release about 85 remaining hostages, along with the bodies of around 40 more, for an extended cease-fire.\n\nNetanyahu: Eliminate remaining military and governing ability\n\nIn response to Biden's suggestion that Hamas was significantly depleted, Netanyahu said Israel would not agree to a permanent cease-fire until \"the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\nThe Israeli army says the eradication of Hamas is still incomplete, with battalions of militants remaining in the southernmost city of Rafah and fighting still raging in Gaza's north. Hamas has continued to launch rockets into Israel, although with far lower intensity than in the first months of war. The extent of the group's governance across the strip remains unclear, though no alternative has emerged.\n\nStill, Netanyahu admits it may be impossible to fully stamp out the ideology of Hamas, which seized control of Gaza in 2007, a year after winning legislative elections against the rival Fatah party. Hamas has managed to survive despite a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt, and four previous wars against Israel.\n\n\"Hamas has to be eliminated, not as an idea,\" Netanyahu said in late March. \"Nazism was not destroyed as an idea in World World II, but Nazis don't govern Germany.\"\n\nIsrael's far right: eradicate Hamas and resettle Gaza\n\nThe far-right firebrands within Israel's ultranationalist government have staunchly rejected Biden's cease-fire proposal, saying Israel must continue its war in Gaza until the militant group is completely stamped out.\n\nIsrael's minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have both threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he endorsed Biden's proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nBen-Gvir has called for the \"voluntary\" emigration of Palestinians from Gaza and for a return of Israeli settlements. Israel unilaterally pulled out of more than 20 Jewish settlements in Gaza in 2005, ending a 38-year presence.\n\nSpeaking at a resettlement conference in May, Ben-Gvir said that the only way to make sure \"the problem won't come back\" was to \"return to Gaza now.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Israel's military declares four more hostages dead\n\nAsked if he believed the Israeli premier was dragging out the war for political self-preservation, Biden said: \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nBiden also said that he and Netanyahu -- who have had tense relations as the Gaza death toll has soared -- were at odds over the need to create a Palestinian state.\n\n\"My major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after... Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" asked the US president.\n\n\"The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday told Netanyahu in a phone call that the Palestinian Authority of president Mahmud Abbas that rules parts of the occupied West Bank should \"ensure the governance\" of the Gaza Strip after the war.\n\nMacron said the proposed truce deal \"should reopen a credible perspective for the implementation of a two-state solution, the only one able to provide Israel with the necessary security guarantees and to respond to the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians\".\n\n- 'Beyond catastrophic' -\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nThe Israeli military on Monday confirmed the latest deaths of captives, naming them as Nadav Popplewell, 51, and three men in their 80s, Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger and Amiram Cooper.\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum group, which has joined a series of mass protests demanding a truce deal, said the men \"should have returned alive to their country and their families\".\n\nIsrael's bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,550 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of Gaza's structures have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\", according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\nAid group Oxfam said displaced Gazans are living in \"appalling\" conditions, with children sometimes going for a whole day without food and thousands sharing the same toilet.\n\n\"Despite Israeli assurances that full support would be provided for people fleeing, most of Gaza has been deprived of humanitarian aid, as famine inches closer,\" the aid agency said.\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk also threw his support behind the truce plan, saying of the war that \"we don't even know how to describe it anymore\".\n\n\"It is beyond precarious.

Although June 13 had been originally proposed for his appearance, according to a person familiar with the situation, that date conflicts with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and no final timing has been announced.\n\nUS officials on Monday, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, called on Hamas to accept the proposal, as did the Group of Seven.\n\nSullivan, speaking at an event in Washington, said Israel had shown \"a willingness to step forward and do a deal,\" and Hamas must now \"come to the table.\" The group, designated a terrorist organization by the US and European Union, has said it's ready \"to deal positively and constructively with any proposal\" based on an indefinite stop to the conflict.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavuot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shavuot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/412413515.jpg?w=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1770, "textEnd": 1776}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 2308, "textEnd": 2315}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The U.S. leader claimed he wants a future \"without Hamas in power,\" but described a series of steps that did not include the terrorist group's elimination or surrender.\n\nWhile Biden administration officials have repeatedly described the deal as an \"Israeli proposal,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that the White House's portrayal of Jerusalem's terms has not been accurate.\n\n\"I am not willing to stop the war. I will not describe the details of the deal, but what the president of the United States described is not accurate,\" Netanyahu said during a closed-door session, according to Kan News.\n\n\"We can stop the fighting for 42 days in order to return hostages, but we will not give up on total victory,\" he was said to have told lawmakers. The premier also said that Biden omitted \"other details\" in his address.\n\nA senior adviser to Netanyahu was quoted on Saturday as saying that while Jerusalem wasn't happy with the proposed terms, it was not flat-out rejecting them. \"It's not a good deal, but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them,\" said Ophir Falk, according to the British Sunday Times.\n\n\"It's a deal we agreed to,\" he stated, adding however that \"there are a lot of details to be worked out,\" including Israel's demand that there be no permanent ceasefire declared \"until all our objectives are met.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News' s \"This Week\" on Sunday, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the Biden administration expects Israel to agree to the deal if Hamas greenlights it.\n\n\"We have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal -- as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal -- that Israel would say 'Yes,'\" Kirby said.\n\nA spokesperson for Qatar's Foreign Ministry stressed on Tuesday afternoon that while Biden's suggested framework brought \"the demands of all parties closer together,\" negotiators in Doha had yet to receive \"clear positions\" from Hamas and Israel in response.

Israeli forces would also withdraw from what a senior Biden administration official called \"densely populated areas.\"\n\nThe remains of some of the hostages who have died would also be returned, and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes and neighborhoods throughout Gaza, including in the north, where Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions. Humanitarian aid deliveries would also scale up dramatically to reach 600 trucks per day, according to Biden.\n\nNegotiators would seek to address outstanding issues during the six-week first phase, including the ratio of Palestinian prisoners that would be freed in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages. The proposal includes language allowing the cease-fire to be extended before the second phase begins, as long as talks continue.\n\nThe prisoner swap ratio is a critical issue because in the second phase, all living hostages would be freed, including all male Israeli military personnel. Israel's forces would also fully withdraw from Gaza.\n\nThe final phase includes the commencement of Gaza's reconstruction, which is estimated to take up to five years, and the return of any additional hostage remains still held in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has continued its brutal offensive on Gaza following a cross-border attack on Oct. 7 last year by the Palestinian group Hamas, despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nMore than 36,400 Palestinians have since been killed in the enclave, the vast majority being women and children, and over 82,600 others injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nNearly eight months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in its latest ruling ordered it to immediately halt its operation in the southern city of Rafah, where

of cease-fire, but questions about Israel remain - WEIS | Local & Area News, Sports, & Weather", "body": "(WASHINGTON) -- Since President Joe Biden's extraordinary move to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding sensitive negotiations aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza -- by detailing the terms of the deal on the table -- U.S. officials have launched into a flurry of diplomatic activity to maximize pressure on Hamas to accept the deal and to ensure Israel would stand by it.\n\nDespite the hard sell from the administration and Biden's appeal to all sides, the many open questions about the long-term provisions of the proposal may jeopardize its future.\n\nOn Monday, Biden spoke by phone with the Emir of Qatar -- another critical mediator in the negotiations -- in order to confirm \"Israel's readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas,\" according to the White House.\n\nDuring their conversation, Biden affirmed that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza,\" a readout of the call said.\n\nThe president's latest engagement builds on calls Secretary of State Antony Blinken held over the weekend with half a dozen foreign ministers of Middle Eastern countries that regularly communicate with Hamas leaders and can exert considerable sway over the group.\n\nHamas leaders issued a statement reacting positively to Biden's address covering the proposal on Friday but have yet to issue any response on the proposal itself, which was transmitted to the group days ago.\n\nWhile the State Department has urged Hamas to take the deal outright, spokesperson Matthew Miller also suggested on Monday that there was still room for compromise.\n\n\"We think this is a serious enough proposal that Hamas should just accept it, but if there need to be further negotiations, we think those all imminently bridgeable -- if, and this is the if -- if Hamas wants a deal,\" he said.\n\nBut across Washington, officials were peppered with questions about Israel's willingness to lay down arms in exchange for the release of scores of hostages held inside Gaza.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby denied that Biden's decision to convey information about the proposed deal was a play to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would abide by the country's commitments.\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister or the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal, how it shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nNetanyahu's conviction was called into question when his office reaffirmed Israel's commitment to ensuring the \"destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel\" before the war ends.\n\n\"Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place,\" an Israeli statement reads. \"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.\"\n\nU.S. officials and the president himself have admitted that the proposed deal contains significant gray areas, particularly in the second and third phases of the agreement which call for \"a permanent end to hostilities\" and \"the major reconstruction of Gaza\" without imposing strict timetables.\n\nAnalysts say the ambiguity is intentional and that the framework is designed to allow both sides to interpret the terms as favorable enough to implement the agreement and gradually ease tension.\n\nHowever, Hamas has spurned any offer that doesn't ensure the group's longtime survival inside Gaza -- and Netanyahu's comments are unlikely to persuade the militants that this proposal is any different.\n\nBrian Katulis, a senior fellow on U.S. foreign policy at the Middle East Institute, argues that this latest chapter of negotiations reflects a change in approach rather than substance.\n\n\"The goal appears to be to spotlight stonewalling by Hamas and right-wing members of the current Israeli government as key roadblocks to a diplomatic settlement,\" Katulis told ABC News.\n\nWhether the strategy ultimately succeeds, he says, will depend on the Biden administration's ability to apply significant, consistent pressure to both sides.\n\n\"For this Biden plan to work will require the U.S. to double down on diplomatic and political efforts in the Middle East, even more so than it already has in the past few months,\" Kautilis said. \"It is not enough to make one-time public statements and expect results.\"", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" asked the US president.\n\n\"The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday told Netanyahu in a phone call that the Palestinian Authority of president Mahmud Abbas that rules parts of the occupied West Bank should \"ensure the governance\" of the Gaza Strip after the war.\n\nMacron said the proposed truce deal \"should reopen a credible perspective for the implementation of a two-state solution, the only one able to provide Israel with the necessary security guarantees and to respond to the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians\".\n\n- 'Beyond catastrophic' -\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nThe Israeli military on Monday confirmed the latest deaths of captives, naming them as Nadav Popplewell, 51, and three men in their 80s, Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger and Amiram Cooper.\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum group, which has joined a series of mass protests demanding a truce deal, said the men \"should have returned alive to their country and their families\".\n\nIsrael's bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,550 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of Gaza's structures have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\", according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\nAid group Oxfam said displaced Gazans are living in \"appalling\" conditions, with children sometimes going for a whole day without food and thousands sharing the same toilet.\n\n\"Despite Israeli assurances that full support would be provided for people fleeing, most of Gaza has been deprived of humanitarian aid, as famine inches closer,\" the aid agency said.\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk also threw his support behind the truce plan, saying of the war that \"we don't even know how to describe it anymore\".\n\n\"It is beyond precarious.

The draft resolution needs nine votes and no vetoes from permanent members. Regional leaders and G7 democracies back the proposal.\n\nThe U.S. said on Monday it wants the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution backing the proposal outlined by President Joe Biden to end fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It circulated a one-page draft text, seen by Reuters, to the 15-member council. A resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the U.S., France, Britain, China or Russia to pass.\n\nThe draft calls on Hamas to accept the deal and \"fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\" It also \"stresses the importance of the parties adhering to the terms of the deal once agreed, with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities.\" The U.S. proposal comes a week after\n\nAlgeria proposed a draft Security Council resolution demanding a Gaza ceasefire, release of all hostages held by Hamas and essentially ordering Israel to \"immediately halt its military offensive\" in Rafah.\n\nBiden on Friday laid out what he described as a three-phase Israeli proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza in return for the release of Israeli hostages, saying \"it's time for this war to end\" and winning a positive initial reaction from Hamas. \"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal,\" said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield in a statement.\n\nShe urged council members to adopt the resolution. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal,\" she said. Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies said in a statement that they \"fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive\" ceasefire and hostage release deal. The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt said it was important to \"deal seriously and positively.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Thomas-Greenfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linda Thomas-Greenfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/03_06_2024_21_09_23_1244668.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

cease-fire, but questions about Israel remain", "body": "The U.S. is pushing both sides to implement an Israeli-authored deal.\n\nSince President Joe Biden's extraordinary move to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding sensitive negotiations aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza -- by detailing the terms of the deal on the table -- U.S. officials have launched into a flurry of diplomatic activity to maximize pressure on Hamas to accept the deal and to ensure Israel would stand by it.\n\nDespite the hard sell from the administration and Biden's appeal to all sides, the many open questions about the long-term provisions of the proposal may jeopardize its future.\n\nOn Monday, Biden spoke by phone with the Emir of Qatar -- another critical mediator in the negotiations -- in order to confirm \"Israel's readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas,\" according to the White House.\n\nDuring their conversation, Biden affirmed that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza,\" a readout of the call said.\n\nThe president's latest engagement builds on calls Secretary of State Antony Blinken held over the weekend with half a dozen foreign ministers of Middle Eastern countries that regularly communicate with Hamas leaders and can exert considerable sway over the group.\n\nHamas leaders issued a statement reacting positively to Biden's address covering the proposal on Friday but have yet to issue any response on the proposal itself, which was transmitted to the group days ago.\n\nWhile the State Department has urged Hamas to take the deal outright, spokesperson Matthew Miller also suggested on Monday that there was still room for compromise.\n\n\"We think this is a serious enough proposal that Hamas should just accept it, but if there need to be further negotiations, we think those all imminently bridgeable -- if, and this is the if -- if Hamas wants a deal,\" he said.\n\nBut across Washington, officials were peppered with questions about Israel's willingness to lay down arms in exchange for the release of scores of hostages held inside Gaza.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby denied that Biden's decision to convey information about the proposed deal was a play to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would abide by the country's commitments.\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister or the war cabinet,\" Kirby said. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal, how it shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nNetanyahu's conviction was called into question when his office reaffirmed Israel's commitment to ensuring the \"destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel\" before the war ends.\n\n\"Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place,\" an Israeli statement reads. \"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.\"\n\nU.S. officials and the president himself have admitted that the proposed deal contains significant gray areas, particularly in the second and third phases of the agreement which call for \"a permanent end to hostilities\" and \"the major reconstruction of Gaza\" without imposing strict timetables.\n\nAnalysts say the ambiguity is intentional and that the framework designed to allow both sides to interpret the terms as favorable enough to implement the agreement and gradually ease tension.\n\nHowever, Hamas has spurned any offer that doesn't ensure the group's longtime survival inside Gaza -- and Netanyahu's comments are unlikely to persuade the militants that this proposal is any different.\n\nBrian Katulis, a senior fellow on U.S. foreign policy at the Middle East Institute, argues that this latest chapter of negotiations reflects a change in approach rather than substance.\n\n\"The goal appears to be to spotlight stonewalling by Hamas and right-wing members of the current Israeli government as key roadblocks to a diplomatic settlement,\" Katulis told ABC News.\n\nWhether the strategy ultimately succeeds, he says, will depend on the Biden administration's ability to apply significant, consistent pressure to both sides.\n\n\"For this Biden plan to work will require the U.S. to double down on diplomatic and political efforts in the Middle East, even more so than it already has in the past few months,\" Kautilis said. \"it is not enough to make one-time public statements and expect results.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5,

So what we hope would happen is they would agree to start phase one as soon as possible, and phase one would allow for some hostages, the elderly, sick women, hostages, to get out over a period of six weeks.\"\n\nThe ceasefire proposal has three phases, according to Biden.

The second would exchange the remaining hostages and have the withdrawal of all Israeli soldiers in Gaza.

But he also understands that he cannot leave it until the next Israeli election in 2026.\"\n\n\"If he can say, 'We exiled Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, they're not living in Gaza' - and if the people living close to Gaza and the northern border can go back - I think he can keep his government together. But it's a lot of 'ifs'.\"\n\nHamas is very unlikely to agree to the exile or surrender of its top figures. But there are clear splits emerging between Hamas leaders inside and outside Gaza.\n\nFormer Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, who has also served as defence minister, told Israeli radio on Monday that President Biden had announced the deal \"after seeing that Netanyahu only moves ahead when he's certain that Sinwar will refuse\".\n\n\"How do you think Sinwar will react when he tends to agree and then he's told: but be quick, because we still have to kill you after you return all the hostages,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, tens of thousands of Israelis displaced after the Hamas attacks on 7 October are watching their prime minister's next move.\n\nAmong them is Yarin Sultan, a 31-year-old mother of three who ran from her home in Sderot on Gaza's border the morning after the Hamas attacks. She says she won't go home until Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif are no longer free.\n\n\"This ceasefire will kill us,\" she told the BBC. \"We will free the hostages, but a few years from now you will be the next hostages, you will be the next people who get murdered, the women that are raped - all this will happen again.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ehud Barak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sderot", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sderot"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sderot"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/7a3982f61f2d0229e257d2ce8c2b6280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 5095, "textEnd": 5104}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

We assess that the four of them were killed while together in the area of Khan Younis during our operation there against Hamas.\"\n\nThree of the men from Kibbutz Nir Oz were seen alive in an earlier Hamas propaganda video.\n\n\"Hamas is holding women, children, the sick, and the elderly hostage in Gaza.,\" Hagari stated. \"We will keep on doing everything we need for their freedom, to bring them home. This is what any other decent country in the world would do.\"\n\nThe Biden administration claims the remaining hostages could be freed and the war would end if Israel and Hamas would accept a ceasefire backed by the White House.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thompson is urging the U.N. Security Council to support the three-phase plan announced by President Biden to end the war.\n\nIsraeli columnist and commentator Caroline Glick told CBN News the latest White House tactic is bad for Israel.\n\n\"So, this is a way of going around the Israeli government, going around the Israeli people, going around the American people to try to compel Israel to capitulate through the United Nations - and did the same thing in 2006 with the nuclear deal that President Obama finalized with Iran that gave Iran an open path to a nuclear arsenal.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the part of the plan that would end the war before Israel destroys Hamas' ability to govern Gaza and strike the Jewish nation.\n\nBiden and his State Department assert the IDF has already weakened Hamas to such an extent that the terrorist group can no longer launch deadly attacks like it did on October 7th. So, in their view, Israel should accept an end to the war now.\n\nState Department Spokesman Matthew Miller insisted, \"Endless conflict in Gaza in pursuit of some idea of total victory is not going to make Israel safer.\"\n\nIsrael counters that the pitched battles and Hamas rocket launches still ongoing in Gaza prove Hamas is far from defeated.\n\nNetanyahu's foreign and domestic opponents claim he won't agree to a ceasefire now because extreme elements in his coalition are pressuring him.\n\nBut the prime minister claims he's being consistent with the War Cabinet's firm goal from the start: no peace until Hamas has been eliminated and all of the hostages are freed.\n\n\"We insist that we complete both this and that,\" Netanyahu stated. \"It's part of the outline, it's not something I'm adding now, it's not something I'm adding because I was pressured in the coalition, it's something we unanimously agreed on in the war cabinet with one voice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there seems to be confusion over when Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress in Washington. Media reports suggest the address has been set for June 13, but the Prime Minister's Office says no date has yet been set.\n\nIn northern Israel, IDF troops and fire and rescue services have gained

At the time, the Biden administration committed to the objective, giving Israel considerable stocks of weaponry and voicing its support.\n\nNearly eight months into the war, however, cracks have emerged between the close allies over what defeating Hamas actually looks like. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden said the militant group was no longer capable of launching an attack on Israel like the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war and that it was time for the fighting to end. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right ministers disagree.\n\nWhere the U.S. seeks a quick end to the fighting, Israel's leadership appears determined to push onward.\n\nBiden on Friday said it was time to end the Israel-Hamas war, signaling that the objective of destroying Hamas had already been met because the militant group was \"no longer capable\" of carrying out a large-scale attack on Israel like the one on Oct. 7.\n\nThat day, Hamas militants astonished Israel with a large-scale assault, killing some 1,200 people and dragging about 250 hostages back to Gaza as rocket fire targeted Israeli cities and towns.\n\nIn the nearly eight months since then, Israel says its air and ground offensive has significantly depleted Hamas' military capabilities. It claims to have killed 15,000 militants, half of Hamas' fighting force, and wounded thousands of others. It also says it has destroyed a significant portion of Gaza's labyrinthine tunnel network, command and control centers and rocket launchers.\n\nBiden appeared Friday to believe this was enough to satisfy Israel's objective. He urged Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement to release about 85 remaining hostages, along with the bodies of around 40 more, for an extended cease-fire.\n\nIn response to Biden's suggestion that Hamas was significantly depleted, Netanyahu said Israel would not agree to a permanent cease-fire until \"the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\nThe Israeli army says the eradication of Hamas is still incomplete, with battalions of militants remaining in the southernmost city of Rafah and fighting still raging in Gaza's north. Hamas has continued to launch rockets into Israel, although with far lower intensity than in the first months of war. The extent of the group's governance across the strip remains unclear, though no alternative has emerged.\n\nStill, Netanyahu admits it may be impossible to fully stamp out the ideology of Hamas, which seized control of Gaza in 2007, a year after winning legislative elections against the rival Fatah party. Hamas has managed to survive despite a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt, and four previous wars against Israel.\n\n\"Hamas has to be eliminated, not as an idea,\" Netanyahu said in late March. \"Nazism was not destroyed as an idea in World World II, but Nazis don't govern Germany.\"\n\nThe far-right firebrands within Israel's ultranationalist government have staunchly rejected Biden's cease-fire proposal, saying Israel must continue its war in Gaza until the militant group is completely stamped out.\n\nIsrael's minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have both threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he endorsed Biden's proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nBen-Gvir has called for the \"voluntary\" emigration of Palestinians from Gaza and for a return of Israeli settlements.

Israel leaders disagree, casting doubts over cease-fire", "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- At the start of its devastating offensive on the Gaza Strip, Israel set an ambitious goal: destroy Hamas. At the time, the Biden administration committed to the objective, giving Israel considerable stocks of weaponry and voicing its support.\n\nBlack smoke rises from an Israeli airstrike on Kafar Hamam, a Lebanese border village with Israel in south Lebanon, on May 17, 2024. President Joe Biden has called for a quick ceasefire and end to the fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, saying the militant group is no longer capable of launching an attack on Israel like the one on Oct. 7. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right ministers disagree, saying that destroying Hamas will require continued Israeli military operations in the strip. (AP Photo/Mohammed Zaatari, File)\n\nNearly eight months into the war, however, cracks have emerged between the close allies over what defeating Hamas actually looks like. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden said the militant group was no longer capable of launching an attack on Israel like the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war and that it was time for the fighting to end. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right ministers disagree.\n\nWhere the U.S. seeks a quick end to the fighting, Israel's leadership appears determined to push onward.\n\nHere is how the leaders define the destruction of Hamas.\n\nBIDEN: NO ABILITY TO POSE A THREAT\n\nBiden on Friday said it was time to end the Israel-Hamas war, signaling that the objective of destroying Hamas had already been met because the militant group was \"no longer capable\" of carrying out a large-scale attack on Israel like the one on Oct. 7.\n\nThat day, Hamas militants astonished Israel with a large-scale assault, killing some 1,200 people and dragging about 250 hostages back to Gaza as rocket fire targeted Israeli cities and towns.\n\nIn the nearly eight months since then, Israel says its air and ground offensive has significantly depleted Hamas' military capabilities. It claims to have killed 15,000 militants, half of Hamas' fighting force, and wounded thousands of others. It also says it has destroyed a significant portion of Gaza's labyrinthine tunnel network, command and control centers and rocket launchers.\n\nBiden appeared Friday to believe this was enough to satisfy Israel's objective. He urged Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement to release about 85 remaining hostages, along with the bodies of around 40 more, for an extended cease-fire.\n\nNETANYAHU: ELIMINATE REMAINING MILITARY AND GOVERNING ABILITY\n\nIn response to Biden's suggestion that Hamas was significantly depleted, Netanyahu said Israel would not agree to a permanent cease-fire until \"the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\nThe Israeli army says the eradication of Hamas is still incomplete, with battalions of militants remaining in the southernmost city of Rafah and fighting still raging in Gaza's north. Hamas has continued to launch rockets into Israel, although with far lower intensity than in the first months of war. The extent of the group's governance across the strip remains unclear, though no alternative has emerged.\n\nStill, Netanyahu admits it may be impossible to fully stamp out the ideology of Hamas, which seized control of Gaza in 2007, a year after winning legislative elections against the rival Fatah party. Hamas has managed to survive despite a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt, and four previous wars against Israel.\n\n\"Hamas has to be eliminated, not as an idea,\" Netanyahu said in late March. \"Nazism was not destroyed as an idea in World World II, but Nazis don't govern Germany.\"\n\nISRAEL'S FAR RIGHT: ERADICATE HAMAS AND RESETTLE GAZA\n\nThe far-right firebrands within Israel's ultranationalist government have staunchly rejected Biden's cease-fire proposal, saying Israel must continue its war in Gaza until the militant group is completely stamped out.\n\nIsrael's minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have both threatened to leave Netanyahu's government if he endorsed Biden's proposal. That would cause the coalition to collapse.\n\nSmotrich said Monday that agreeing to a cease-fire would amount to a humiliation of Israel and a surrender. Increased military pressure, he said, is \"the only language understood in the Middle East.\"\n\nBen-Gvir has called for the \"voluntary\" emigration of Palestinians from Gaza and for a return of Israeli settlements. Israel unilaterally pulled out of more than 20 Jewish settlements in Gaza in 2005, ending a 38-year presence.\n\nSpeaking at a resettlement conference in May, Ben-Gvir said that the only way to make sure \"the problem won't come back\" was to \"return to Gaza now.\"", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The plan includes a cease-fire, a hostage-prisoner exchange, and reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nThe two ministers reiterated support for efforts aimed at reaching a cease-fire in Gaza and urged Hamas and

operations in the strip, especially in Rafah, and opening all crossings between Israel and Gaza to allow the full entry of aid.\n\nThere was no official response yet from Israel or Hamas on Biden's

cease-fire.\n\nMore than 36,500 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, the vast majority being women and children, and nearly 83,000 others injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nNearly eight months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which in its latest ruling has ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its operation in the southern city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.\n\n*Writing by Mohammad Sio -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Friday, Biden presented what he claimed to be a new Israeli proposal for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, rather than a temporary one, as part of a three-phase plan to fully end the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Israel has offered a comprehensive new proposal,\" Biden told reporters on Friday. \"It's a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages.\"\n\nBut a permanent ceasefire at this stage of the war could allow Hamas, which has not been fully defeated and retains forces throughout Gaza, to regroup, return, and eventually stage an attack against Israel, similar to the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 people, experts told the DCNF.\n\n\"If this war ends now and Israeli forces withdraw, let's say within six weeks or two months, then the nucleus of Hamas' presence remains, and that is going to allow the group to rearm -- and they're not just rearming on their own,\" David Daoud, senior fellow on Middle Eastern affairs the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the DCNF. \"They have allies in the region, from Iran to Hezbollah, that are going to help them rearm and regroup. And what we're going to end up with is a situation where, you know, five, definitely, 10 years, Hamas might be ready to commit another Oct. 7.\"\n\n\"This only perpetuates the cycle of violence as Hamas regroups and attacks again,\" Victoria Coates, Heritage Foundation executive and former White House national security advisor, told the DCNF. \"The only way there could be an end to all military operations in Gaza right now is if Hamas lays down their arms.\"\n\nIt is difficult to determine the exact number of casualties Hamas has sustained since it started its war against Israel on Oct. 7. Hamas was estimated to have roughly 30,000 fighters located throughout Gaza before that date; eight months into fighting, the IDF has killed more than 14,000 fighters, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's most recent estimate.\n\nA bulk of the fighters are believed to be located in Rafah, the southernmost region of Gaza and the last large-scale theater for a conflict between the IDF and Hamas. Hamas and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled into Rafah after the IDF seized control of the northern and southern regions.\n\nThe Biden administration and the international community have pressured Israel not to launch a full ground assault in Rafah, citing the disproportional impact it could have on civilians. Additionally, the Biden administration believes that Israel has crippled Hamas enough to a point where massive military operations are no longer needed, a position Biden reiterated on Friday.\n\n\"At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7,\" Biden told reporters on Friday. \"I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some -- some are even in the government coalition... Well, I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes.\"\n\nEven with the damage Hamas has suffered, experts warned that too many fighters remain to ensure that the terrorist group could never stage another \"Oct. 7,\" in Biden's words. Aside from the Hamas battalions that remain in Rafah, fighters have resurged in northern and central Gaza and attacked IDF forces who took control of those regions.\n\n\"Biden is focused on this idea that Hamas doesn't have to be destroyed, that it needs to merely be degraded into that carried out another Oct. 7 style attack, and that's good enough. I think that's preposterous,\" Gabriel Noronha, executive director of Polaris National Security and former State Department official, told the DCNF. \" It's consistent with what policy, which is this obsession with preventing the destruction of our enemies. So that's what he's trying to do.\"\n\nNoronha compared Biden's proposed end to the war to his approach to Afghanistan, in which he claimed that \"al-Qaeda would not\" come back to the region after U.S. troops withdrew in 2021. Yet, Al-Qaida has since returned to Afghanistan and has established several military training camps and safe houses, maintaining a close relationship with the Taliban for protection.\n\n\"Just like in Afghanistan, Biden is trying to do a timeline, political-based end to the war, to sequester involvement in the war, and not a conditions-based end,\" Noronha told the DCNF. \"It's a copy-paste into a new battlefield and environment with the same principles.\"\n\nThere's also confusion over whether the plan Biden presented on Friday was fully an Israeli proposal, as he claimed it was. Netanyahu's office said on Friday and Saturday that the \"actual\" proposal that Israel had presented would allow for a permanent ceasefire only after the \"destruction\" of Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu said until that condition is met, a ceasefire is a \"non-starter.\"\n\n\"Biden should be releasing a plan that supports our ally Israel's objective of completely destroying Hamas, but his administration unmistakably has sought to undermine it,\" Michael Bars, former White House senior communications advisor and National Security Council official, told the DCNF. \"Israel has continually maintained that it won't let terrorists off the hook in Gaza, but the proposal appears to be yet another public pressure point to achieve an outcome closer to that.\"\n\nIt isn't clear why Biden's and Netanyahu's proposals differed, but some experts mused that Biden could have been interpreting the deal in a way that favored a permanent ceasefire, which a large portion of his voting bloc has demanded he call for.\n\nThe Biden reelection campaign has been working to shore up support from Muslim communities and groups who have become increasingly frustrated with his handling of the conflict, especially in battleground states like Michigan, which has a high Arab population. Only 26% of voters approve of Biden's performance in the Israel-Hamas war as of May, compared to 60% who disapproved, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll from May 10.\n\n\"Is this a good proposal, no. The kind of deal where Hamas accepts Israel's existence, commits to never violate its sovereignty again, and follows through with that? Anyone who thinks that's going to happen is living in a very alternate version of reality,\" Daoud said. \"Hamas is ideologically committed to Israel's destruction. There is no possibility that, as long as Hamas exists, a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Gaza will ever exist.\"\n\nThe White House National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

They have also all appeared alive in Hamas propaganda videos in recent months.\n\nFollowing the IDF spokesman's press conference, the Hostages' Families Forum issued a statement expressing its \"anguish\" at the news. 'It should shock every citizen of the State of Israel and provoke a profound examination of conscience in every leader,' the association said.\n\nLikewise, the families of the abductees have again demanded that the Israeli government accept the truce agreement recently presented by the United States. 'It is time to end this cycle of sacrifice and abandonment. Their murder in captivity is a disgrace and a sad reflection of the importance of delaying previous agreements,' the statement said.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Friday publicly announced a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza that would also include the gradual release of hostages. This plan has caused rifts within the Israeli government, with far-right members threatening to overthrow the coalition if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepts it.\n\nSince then, protests in Israel have intensified to pressure the government to accept the proposal, which would allow the release and return home of the more than 100 hostages held hostage, as well as the possibility of a dignified burial for the dead whose bodies are still in Gaza.\n\nWashington's three-phase plan would end the conflict in Gaza, free all hostages and allow for the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian enclave without Hamas in power.\n\nIn the words of US President Joe Biden, Israel is prepared to move forward with the proposal, as he conveyed to Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, whom he asked to press Hamas to accept the plan as well.\n\nAccording to the White House, Biden 'confirmed Israel's willingness to move forward with the terms now offered to Hamas' and 'urged [the emir] to use all appropriate measures to secure Hamas's acceptance of the agreement'.\n\nWashington is again pressing Doha, which is home to many Hamas leaders, to take a tougher stance against the terrorist group in order to secure the release of the hostages. Last April, Secretary of State Antony Blinken privately called on Qatari Prime Minister Mohamed Al-Thani to expel Hamas leaders if they continued to reject the agreements.\n\nFor their part, other countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have endorsed the US proposal, saying it is important to approach it in a 'serious and positive' way.\n\nThe Foreign Ministers of these countries and Qatar met virtually to discuss the proposal and mediation efforts by Washington, Doha and Cairo for an agreement to exchange Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners to allow a permanent ceasefire and more humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nThe ministers stressed the need to halt the Israeli military operation in Gaza, end the humanitarian crisis and allow displaced persons to return home. They also stressed the implementation of the two-state solution, which includes an independent and sovereign Palestinian state similar to that of 4 June 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nFor the plan to go ahead, however, it needs the approval of Hamas leaders, who are already awaiting a detailed proposal for the deal, Arab mediators told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe US newspaper says the terrorist group wants a deal that does not allow Israel to resume war after the hostages are released, something Jerusalem has repeatedly rejected.\n\nLikewise, Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, told Arab mediators that he is 'in no hurry to end the war', believing that the conflict is isolating Israel internationally and advancing the Palestinian cause.\n\nBy contrast, Hamas's political leaders in exile want an end to the war 'provided that an agreement guarantees the group's survival and grants it a continued role in Gaza's government'.\n\nIn recent days, the Islamic Republic of Iran-backed Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah has stepped up its attacks on northern Israel, setting fires in places such as Kiryat Shemona, a border town that has been largely uninhabited due to Hezbollah's constant attacks since October.\n\nAs a result of these actions, thousands of people in northern Israel have been forced to leave their homes, to which they have been unable to return for the past 8 months.\n\nThe few remaining residents and local authorities have demanded that the government take strong measures to restore security in the area while far-right ministers are calling for a direct war with Lebanon, something Jerusalem has tried to avoid in recent months due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n\nAccording to the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, the recent spate of rocket and drone attacks in recent days caused forest fires that consumed more than 2,470 hectares in open areas, including nature reserves, reports The Times of Israel.", "source": {"uri":

On Friday, Biden presented what he claimed to be a new Israeli proposal for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, rather than a temporary one, as part of a three-phase plan to fully end the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Israel has offered a comprehensive new proposal,\" Biden told reporters on Friday. \"It's a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages.\"\n\nBut a permanent ceasefire at this stage of the war could allow Hamas, which has not been fully defeated and retains forces throughout Gaza, to regroup, return and eventually stage an attack against Israel, similar to the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 people, experts told the DCNF.\n\n\"If this war ends now and Israeli forces withdraw, let's say within six weeks or two months, then the nucleus of Hamas' presence remains, and that is going to allow the group to rearm -- and they're not just rearming on their own,\" David Daoud, senior fellow on Middle Eastern affairs the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the DCNF. \"They have allies in the region, from Iran to Hezbollah, that are going to help them rearm and regroup. And what we're going to end up with is a situation where, you know, five, definitely, 10 years, Hamas might be ready to commit another Oct. 7.\"\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\n\"This only perpetuates the cycle of violence as Hamas regroups and attacks again,\" Victoria Coates, Heritage Foundation executive and former White House national security advisor, told the DCNF. \"The only way there could be an end to all military operations in Gaza right now is if Hamas lays down their arms.\"\n\nIt is difficult to determine the exact number of casualties Hamas has sustained since it started its war against Israel on Oct. 7. Hamas was estimated to have roughly 30,000 fighters located throughout Gaza before that date; eight months into fighting, the IDF has killed more than 14,000 fighters, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's most recent estimate.\n\nA bulk of the fighters are believed to be located in Rafah, the southernmost region of Gaza and the last large-scale theater for a conflict between the IDF and Hamas. Hamas and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled into Rafah after the IDF seized control of the northern and southern regions.\n\nThe Biden administration and the international community have pressured Israel not to launch a full ground assault in Rafah, citing the disproportional impact it could have on civilians. Additionally, the Biden administration believes that Israel has crippled Hamas enough to a point where massive military operations are no longer needed, a position Biden reiterated on Friday.\n\n\"At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7,\" Biden told reporters on Friday. \"I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some -- some are even in the government coalition... Well, I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes.\"\n\nEven with the damage Hamas has suffered, experts warned that too many fighters remain to ensure that the terrorist group could never stage another \"Oct. 7,\" in Biden's words. Aside from the Hamas battalions that remain in Rafah, fighters have resurged in northern and central Gaza and attacked IDF forces who took control of those regions.\n\n\"Biden is focused on this idea that Hamas doesn't have to be destroyed, that it needs to merely be degraded into that carried out another Oct. 7 style attack, and that's good enough. I think that's preposterous,\" Gabriel Noronha, executive director of Polaris National Security and former State Department official, told the DCNF. \" It's consistent with what policy, which is this obsession with preventing the destruction of our enemies. So that's what he's trying to do.\"\n\nNoronha compared Biden's proposed end to the war to his approach to Afghanistan, in which he claimed that \"al-Qaeda would not\" come back to the region after U.S. troops withdrew in 2021. Yet, Al-Qaida has since returned to Afghanistan and has established several military training camps and safe houses, maintaining a close relationship with the Taliban for protection.\n\n\"Just like in Afghanistan, Biden is trying to do a timeline, political-based end to the war, to sequester involvement in the war, and not a conditions-based end,\" Noronha told the DCNF. \"It's a copy-paste into a new battlefield and environment with the same principles.\"\n\nThere's also confusion over whether the plan Biden presented on Friday was fully an Israeli proposal, as he claimed it was. Netanyahu's office said on Friday and Saturday that the \"actual\" proposal that Israel had presented would allow for a permanent ceasefire only after the \"destruction\" of Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu said until that condition is met, a ceasefire is a \"non-starter.\"\n\n\"Biden should be releasing a plan that supports our ally Israel's objective of completely destroying Hamas, but his administration unmistakably has sought to undermine it,\" Michael Bars, former White House senior communications advisor and National Security Council official, told the DCNF. \"Israel has continually maintained that it won't let terrorists off the hook in Gaza, but the proposal appears to be yet another public pressure point to achieve an outcome closer to that.\"\n\nIt isn't clear why Biden's and Netanyahu's proposals differed, but some experts mused that Biden could have been interpreting the deal in a way that favored a permanent ceasefire, which a large portion of his voting bloc has demanded he call for.\n\nThe Biden reelection campaign has been working to shore up support from Muslim communities and groups who have become increasingly frustrated with his handling of the conflict, especially in battleground states like Michigan, which has a high Arab population. Only 26% of voters approve of Biden's performance in the Israel-Hamas war as of May, compared to 60% who disapproved, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll from May 10.\n\n\"Is this a good proposal, no. The kind of deal where Hamas accepts Israel's existence, and commits to never violate its sovereignty again, and follows through with that? Anyone who thinks that's going to happen is living in a very alternate version of reality,\" Daoud said. \"Hamas is ideologically committed to Israel's destruction. There is no possibility that, as long as Hamas exists, a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Gaza will ever exist.\"\n\nThe White House National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Leaders of these parties have expressed support for a forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and the reoccupation of the enclave, including reestablishing settlements.\n\nAfter briefly leaving office, Netanyahu returned to power in December 2022, leading a coalition of six right-wing parties.\n\nBefore 7 October 2023, his government was already at odds with Washington over its call to expand illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, increase protections for conservative Jews in public life and, most controversially, strengthen elected lawmakers' power over Israel's Supreme Court, which far-right and religious lawmakers view as a bastion of leftist and secular influence in Israel.\n\nBiden made a rare move in 2023 to wade directly into Israel's debate over Netanyahu's Supreme Court overhaul, suggesting it weakened Israel's democracy.\n\nThe overhaul has been overshadowed by Israel's war on Gaza and escalating regional tensions, but Biden revived the topic on Tuesday.\n\n\"And I would cite tha [sic] as - before the war began, the blowback he was getting from the Israeli military for wanting to change the constitu [sic] - change the court,\" Biden said, \"so it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence.\"\n\nOn Friday, Biden made the unprecedented decision of announcing from the White House podium what he described as an Israeli hostage exchange and ceasefire proposal to end the war in Gaza. Biden laid out in rare detail the specifics of the three-phase agreement, including a clause that calls for a \"permanent cessation of hostilities\" between Hamas and Israel.\n\nHamas responded \"positively\" to the proposal shortly after Biden's speech.\n\nNetanyahu's office also released a statement saying that Israel had authorised its negotiating team to present an offer to Hamas.\n\nThe statement didn't endorse or reject the proposal, which the White House attributed to Israel, but said the war would not end until the \"elimination\" of Hamas's capacity to govern Gaza and wage war. This language marked a departure from Israel's previous calls for a total elimination of Hamas, an objective that Biden said is unachievable.\n\nHowever, over the past two days, Israeli officials, both on and off the record, have distanced Israel from Biden's proposal. NBC News cited an Israeli official who said Biden's speech did not accurately represent the deal.\n\nNetanyahu also told lawmakers there were gaps between the proposal Biden described and the actual offer made to Hamas.\n\nAccording to reports of his meeting with Israeli lawmakers, Netanyahu appears to support the first phase of Biden's proposal but has said that Israel reserves the right to destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities in the later stages of the agreement.\n\nThis stance suggests that Israel is hedging to restart the fighting, especially because Hamas still has fighters in the field and its top military officials in Gaza have not been killed by Israel.\n\n\"The proposal allows Israel to preserve the right to renew fighting at any time Israel senses that the negotiations are futile,\" the WSJ reported, citing an Israeli official.\n\nThe Israeli comments come after two top far-right lawmakers in Netaynahu's government, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, threatened to leave the government if Netanyahu agrees to the deal outlined by Biden.\n\nAnalysts and Israeli commentators say Netanyahu could face an inquiry into his handling of the surprise Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 when the war ends.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Eye"}, "authors":

The Israeli leader claimed Biden presented the public with an \"incomplete\" version of the plan, maintaining there are \"gaps\" between it and what the American president laid out.\n\nBut State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller maintained that the Biden administration is \"completely confident\" that what Biden presented \"was an Israeli proposal.\"\n\n\"Obviously, it was a proposal that they developed in consultation with the United States and Qatar and Egypt, the three countries that have played the mediating role throughout this process, but this was ultimately an Israeli proposal in terms of where it stands,\" he said.\n\n\"The only thing standing in the way of an immediate ceasefire today is Hamas,\" he added.\n\nHamas, for its part, said it will \"respond positively to any proposal that includes a permanent cease-fire, a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction efforts, the return of the displaced, and the completion of a comprehensive hostage exchange deal.\"\n\nThe proposal, as laid out by Biden, envisions a three-phase agreement that would culminate with a multi-year process to rebuild the badly-damaged coastal enclave, and the return of all hostages, living and dead, held in Gaza.\n\nThe remains of some of the hostages who have died would also be returned, and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes and neighborhoods throughout Gaza, including in the north where Israel has implemented sweeping restrictions. Humanitarian aid deliveries would also scale up dramatically to reach 600 trucks per day, according to Biden.\n\nNegotiators would seek to address outstanding issues during the six-week first phase, including the ratio of Palestinian prisoners that would be freed in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages. The proposal includes language allowing the cease-fire to be extended before the second phase begins so long as talks continue.\n\nThe final phase includes the commencement of Gaza's reconstruction, which is estimated to take up to five years, and the return of any additional hostage remains still held in Gaza.\n\nMore than 36,400 Palestinians have since Israel began its war on Gaza eight months ago. The vast majority of the dead have been women and children, and over 82,600 others have been injured, according to local health authorities. The Hamas-led cross-border attack that precipitated the current war led to about 1,200 deaths.\n\nVast swathes of Gaza now lay in ruins amid a crippling Israeli blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in its latest ruling has ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its operation in the southern city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "authors": [{"uri": "piri_medya_a_s@yenisafak.com", "name": "Piri Medya A.\u015e.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli disengagement from Gaza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade of the Gaza Strip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://img.piri.net/piri/upload/3/2024/6/4/ba85bfc3-6ccitvzugfpv8iu6audp2o.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 3269, "textEnd": 3274}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

All times Eastern:\n\nJun 04, 12:36 PM\n\nHamas responds unfavorably to current cease-fire proposal\n\nHamas officials are not responding favorably to President Joe Biden's speech Friday and what they call the current proposal on the table.\n\nA Hamas leader said no Hamas delegation has gone to Cairo, and the group is not accepting the offer given to them by mediators, the leader told Al-Mayadeen, a Lebanese news channel.\n\n\"We do not want to start from scratch, and our basic condition now is official Israeli approval of the previous paper, otherwise there will be no rounds and discussions,\" the leader said to Al-Mayadeen.\n\nSeparately, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said the group frowns upon Washington and the West's calls for it to accept Biden's proposal on Gaza \"as if it is Hamas who is hampering the deal,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nIsrael is not serious about reaching a deal in Gaza and is still maneuvering under the U.S.'s cover, Abu Zuhri said to Hamas media.\n\n-ABC News' Nasser Atta\n\nJun 04, 12:02 PM\n\nQatar says Israel and Hamas should have clear positions for Gaza cease-fire\n\nQatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it was \"too early\" to reach a cease-fire deal and that there should be a clear position from both sides on the U.S. truce proposal.\n\n\"We are waiting for a clear Israeli position that represent the entire Israeli government,\" Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari told reporters during a press briefing on Tuesday. \"Any talk of reaching a deal needs a clear position from both sides towards ideas put on the table.\"\n\nThe deal should offer a road map for a permanent cease-fire and an end to the war, he said.\n\n\"It is too early thus far. We do not have clear positions from both sides,\" he said, adding that mediators remain hopeful as they push ahead with efforts to reach a deal but are \"not always optimistic.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will deliver an address before the two houses of the U.S. Congress, his office confirmed Monday.\n\nA date has not been set yet, his office said.\n\nPlans for Netanyahu's address come after Congressional big four leaders invited Netanyahu in a joint letter sent Friday.\n\nJun 03, 4:10 PM\n\nFour hostages confirmed dead\n\nIsraeli forces confirmed the deaths of four more hostages: Haim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popplewell.\n\nIDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said the four hostages were \"killed together\" a \"few months ago\" while \"IDF forces were operating\" in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Hagari said Israeli forces are \"examining the circumstances\" of their deaths.\n\nCooper, 85, was an economist and a poet, and a father of four and grandfather of 11, according to Kibbutz Nir Oz. His wife, Nurit Cooper, was also kidnapped and later released, the kibbutz said.\n\nMetzger, 80, was a father of three and grandfather of seven. His wife, Tamar Metzger, was also abducted to Gaza and later released, the kibbutz said.\n\nPopplewell, 51, was kidnapped with his mother, who has been released, the Hostages Families Forum said.\n\nPeri, 80, was abducted while protecting his wife, the Hostages Families Forum said. He leaves behind his wife, five children and 13 grandchildren.\n\nPeri's family said he \"heroically survived in the Hamas tunnels, under inhumane conditions, for around 4 months,\" and he \"survived with the hope and faith that the state of Israel will fulfill its moral duty to bring him home.\"\n\n\"The government of Israel and its Prime Minister have no right to leave the hostages in captivity, dismantling Israel's foundational principle of mutual responsibility,\" Peri's family said. \"We call upon the government of Israel to strive for an immediate deal, save those still alive, and bring those who are not, to a proper burial.\"\n\n\"The heartbreak that comes with this painful news should shake every citizen in the State of Israel and lead every leader to profound soul-searching,\" the Hostages Families Forum said in a statement Monday. \"The Israeli government must send out a negotiating delegation this evening and return all 124 hostages, both living and murdered. ... We reiterate our demand to the Israeli government: approve the Netanyahu deal immediately!\"\n\nJun 03, 4:05 PM\n\nBiden says Israel ready to 'move forward with the terms' of deal, Hamas is 'only obstacle'\n\nPresident Joe Biden told the emir of Qatar on Monday that Israel is ready to \"move forward with the terms\" of the hostage and cease-fire deal, according to the White House readout of the call.\n\nBiden said that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire,\" and the president \"urged [Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani] to use all appropriate measures to secure Hamas' acceptance of the deal,\" the White House said.\n\nJun 03, 3:20 PM\n\nState Department: Hamas only party blocking deal\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the current cease-fire proposal is \"nearly identical to what Hamas said it would accept just a few weeks ago,\" and said the U.S. and other mediators had not yet received an official response to the proposal from the militant group.\n\n\"The world should know, the Palestinian people should know, that the only thing standing in the way of an immediate cease-fire today is Hamas,\" Miller declared.\n\nMiller said there were some gaps between the proposal Hamas said it would agree to in the past, but added that the U.S., Qatar and Egypt all felt that they could be easily reconciled.\n\nJun 03, 2:56 PM\n\nEgypt, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE support cease-fire deal\n\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates released a joint statement Monday in support of the current cease-fire deal.\n\nThe ministers met virtually to discuss the proposal and mediation efforts to reach a deal and hostages-for-prisoners swap, as well as the sufficient entry of aid into Gaza, the statement said.\n\nThe G7 leaders also issued a statement in support of the current deal.\n\nJun 03, 1:27 PM\n\nWhite House: Biden outlined Israel's cease-fire offer accurately\n\nPresident Joe Biden outlined Israel's cease-fire proposal accurately in his Friday speech, the White House maintained Monday, pushing back on suggestions he miscommunicated the offer.\n\n\"The Israeli foreign minister himself acknowledged that this was the Israeli proposal ... and we're confident that it accurately reflects that proposal, a proposal that we worked with the Israelis on,\" White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told reporters.\n\nKirby also argued that Biden \"felt it was important\" to reveal details from ongoing cease-fire negotiations for the first time, saying it was meant to apply pressure on Hamas, not to corner Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"We don't typically go through the details of these kinds of proposals,\" Kirby said. \"But in this case, given where we are, given how much longer the hostages have now been held, given the fact that Hamas has reneged on several past occasions, on proposals that were sent to them, and given the fact that the Israelis really did work hard to come up with this proposal, and did so in good faith, the president felt it was important for the first time to publicly lay that out.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister or the war cabinet,\" Kirby added. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal, how it shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nKirby said Biden delivered the speech on Friday afternoon because the deal was presented to Hamas the night before.\n\n\"We're awaiting an official response by them now to take the deal,\" Kirby said. \"This gives them what they've been looking for, which is a cease-fire and over time, and through the phases, the potential withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\"\n\n-ABC News' Fritz Farrow\n\nJun 03, 12:35 PM\n\nNetanyahu: Israel must work to bring hostages home, dismantle Hamas at same time\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has released his first public statement since President Joe Biden's Friday speech endorsing the original Israeli cease-fire deal.\n\n\"We are working in countless ways to return our abductees,\" Netanyahu said in Hebrew on Monday. \"That's why we went a long way to bring them back, but in the process of this action we maintained the goals of the war, chief among them the elimination of Hamas.\"\n\n\"We insist that we complete both this and that. It's part of the outline, it's not something I'm adding now, it's not something I'm adding because I was pressured in the coalition, it's something we unanimously agreed on in the war cabinet,\" Netanyahu added.\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled Rafah in the weeks since Israel issued evacuation orders, the local U.N. agency said Monday.\n\n\"Thousands of families now shelter in damaged & destroyed facilities in Khan Younis, where UNRWA keeps providing essential services despite increasing challenges,\" the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said in a statement.\n\nSec. of State Anthony Blinken spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday about the proposal for a ceasefire-hostage deal.\n\nThe deal would secure the release of the hostages and ensure a surge in humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza.\n\n\"The Secretary commended Israel's readiness to conclude a deal and affirmed that the onus is on Hamas to accept,\" according to a readout of the call.\n\nDuring the call, Blinken also reaffirmed America's commitment to Israel's security.\n\nJun 01, 4:38 PM\n\nUS, Qatar and Egypt urge Israel and Hamas to accept deal\n\nIn a joint statement shared by the U.S. State Department on Saturday, mediators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar said they're working to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of the hostages, and urged Hamas and Israel \"to finalize the agreement\" that President Joe Biden outlined on Friday.\n\n\"These principles brought the demands of all parties together in a deal that serves multiple interests and will bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families,\" the statement said. \"This deal offers a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and ending the crisis.\"\n\nJun 01, 3:54 PM\n\nRight-wing Israeli ministers against deal\n\nRight-wing Israeli Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir spoke out on social media Saturday, both threatening to leave the government if the deal in its current form is accepted.\n\n\"I have now spoken with the Prime Minister and made it clear to him that I will not be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the abductees,\" Smotrich wrote.\n\nThis comes after the Hostage Families group released a statement urging Israel's parliament to embrace the deal.\n\nJun 01, 2:43 PM\n\nIsraeli government says it wasn't told Biden would mention permanent cease-fire\n\nAn Israeli government official said the Israeli Prime Minister's Office wasn't informed that President Joe Biden's Friday remarks would include a permanent end to the fighting.\n\n\"If you listen to what Biden said, you come to the impression that we agree to a permanent cease-fire without, or, without our conditions being met, and that's not the case,\" the official said.\n\nThe official said the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was informed 30 minutes before that Biden was giving a speech. The official said Netanyahu was told that the speech would focus on the hostages, with no mention of implementing a permanent cease-fire.\n\nBiden presented on Friday what he said was an Israeli proposal to draw the war in Gaza to a close.\n\nBiden said the deal had been transmitted to Israel and Hamas, through Qatar.\n\nThe president said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza [and] release of a number of hostages.\" Palestinians would also be able to return to their homes and 600 trucks of humanitarian aid would be delivered to Gaza every day.\n\nThe second phase would include a release of all remaining living hostages and the temporary cease-fire would become a permanent cease-fire with Israel withdrawing all forces from Gaza \"as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments,\" Biden said.\n\nIn phase three, there would be a major reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nEgyptian and Israeli officials will hold talks in Cairo on Sunday to discuss the reopening the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, an Egyptian security official confirmed to ABC News.\n\nThe crossing has been closed since Israeli forces took control of the Gaza side during their offensive toward Rafah in May. Egyptian officials have said they will not reopen the crossing as long as Israel controls the Gaza side.\n\nEgypt has, however, agreed to send aid trucks from its side of the border to be processed from the Israeli border checkpoint of Kerem Shalom.\n\nAlthough President Joe Biden on Friday outlined a multi-phase cease-fire proposal he said came from Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement Saturday that \"Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\n\"Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent cease-fire is put in place,\" the statement said. \"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent cease-fire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.\"\n\nBiden said Friday that Israelis should feel comfortable with a cease-fire because Hamas's capabilities have deteriorated and can no longer repeat the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks.\n\nHamas in a statement reiterated its requirements for a deal. Hamas said it \"affirms its position of readiness to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent cease-fire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction, the return of the displaced to all their places of residence, and the completion of a serious prisoner exchange deal.\"\n\nMay 31, 5:15 PM\n\nCongressional leaders formally invite Netanyahu to deliver joint address\n\nThe four leaders of the House of Representatives and Senate formally invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to deliver a joint address to Congress.\n\nThe letter sent on Friday by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did not provide a date with the address.\n\nThe congressional leaders asked Netanyahu to \"share the Israeli government's vision for defending democracy, combatting terror, and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.\"\n\n\"The existential challenges we face, including the growing partnership between Iran, Russia, and China, threaten the security, peace, and prosperity of our countries and of free people around the world,\" the letter read.\n\nNetanyahu last addressed Congress in 2015.\n\nMay 31, 4:03 PM\n\nIsrael 'united' in desire to return hostages, Netanyahu responds to Biden\n\nHours after President Joe Biden outlined a three-phase cease-fire deal to end the Israel-Hamas war and said it is time to bring the hostages home, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded, saying its government is \"united in the desire to return abductees.\"\n\n\"The Israeli government is united in the desire to return our abductees as soon as possible and is working to achieve this goal,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement Friday.\n\n\"The Prime Minister authorized the negotiating team to present an outline for achieving this goal, while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our abductees and the elimination of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities,\" Netanyahu's office added.\n\nMay 31, 2:07 PM\n\nBiden pitches three-phase cease-fire deal to end Israel-Hamas war\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave remarks from the White House on Friday, pitching a new plan to draw the war in Gaza to a close.\n\nBiden said the deal had been transmitted to Israel and Hamas, through Qatar.\n\nThe president said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza [and] release of a number of hostages.\" Palestinians would also be able to return to their homes and 600 trucks of humanitarian aid would be delivered to Gaza every day.\n\nThe second phase would include a release of all remaining living hostages and the temporary cease-fire would become a permanent cease-fire with Israel withdrawing all forces from Gaza \"as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments,\" Biden said.\n\nIn phase three, there would be a major reconstruction of Gaza.\n\n\"At this point Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7, which was one of the Israelis' main objectives in this war, and, quite frankly, a righteous one,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden continued, \"We can't lose this moment. Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory ... will only bog down Israel in Gaza -- draining the economic, military and human resources and furthering Israel's isolation in the world.

These types of SDB/GBU-39 weapons can carry a 37 pound warhead, consistent with statements from the IDF about what weapons were used in the strike, Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordinance disposal specialist, said.\n\n\"We used two small rockets, 17 kg warhead, that were fired from aircraft to hit, precisely. We've used this kind of ammunition before,\" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told ABC News when asked about what weapons were used in the strike.\n\nBall identified a series of numbers beginning with \"81873'' marked on one fragment seen in video reviewed by ABC News. This is the Commercial and Government Entity Code, or CAGE Code, assigned by the U.S. government to aerospace manufacturing company Woodward, based in Colorado, according to U.S. government records.\n\nA second former U.S. military explosive ordinance disposal specialist confirmed the fragments were consistent with the GBU-39, but asked to not be named by ABC News.\n\nAll sales of GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs to foreign entities require the State Department's approval, but a U.S. official says Israel may have also procured the munitions through direct commercial sales that don't meet the value threshold -- $25 million in Israel's case -- for congressional review and public notification.\n\nIn the days following the Oct. 7 attack, Israel rushed to back up its stockpiles, including its supply of the small diameter bombs by any available means, the official said. ABC News has not confirmed if the weapons Israel received after Oct. 7 were used in the May 26 Rafah strike.\n\nWhen asked if the bombs used in the strike were provided by the U.S., deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said reporters needed to ask the Israelis during a briefing on May 28.\n\n-ABC News' Chris Looft, Helena Skinner, Britt Clennett, Sohel Uddin, Luis Martinez, Matt Seyler, Shannon Crawford, Ellie Kaufman and Camilla Alcini\n\nMay 29, 3:50 PM\n\nWorld Central Kitchen suspends operations in Rafah over safety\n\nWorld Central Kitchen has suspended its humanitarian efforts in Rafah due to safety concerns.

Our view, in our opinion, is we gotta get this hostage deal now.

And to end as soon as practicable.\"\n\nKirby confirmed that there is a \"fresh\" proposal on the table that the Israels are \"fully supportive of,\" but it is too \"fresh\" to provide details on. He emphasized that the Biden administration still believes there is a path for a cease-fire deal that could \"lead to something more sustainable\" and a \"potential end of the conflict.\"\n\nKirby also said the fighting \"could end tomorrow if Mr. Sinwar did the right thing and agreed to this deal,\" referring to the Hamas leader.\n\n-ABC News' Cheyenne Haslett\n\nMay 29, 1:30 PM\n\nBlinken reacts to 'horrific' Rafah strike, questions whether Israeli gains are worth consequences\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke about the catastrophic strike over the weekend in Rafah -- becoming the first top-level U.S. official to publicly respond to the attack in detail.\n\n\"The incident a couple days ago was horrific,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone who has seen the images cannot be deeply affected by them, just on a basic human level.\"\n\nBlinken was also asked about reports indicating that the U.S. supplied the weapons used in the strike; he said he couldn't yet say where they came from, but if Israel's claims that it used small diameter munitions were true, the incident illustrated how even precision attacks could cause immense damage to civilians in Rafah.\n\n\"I think we also see that even limited, focused, targeted attacks, designed to deal with terrorists who've killed innocent civilians that are plotting to kill more -- even those kinds of operations can have terrible, horrific, unintended consequences,\" he said.\n\nBlinken then said it was \"very important in this moment after Israel has had real success in helping to destroy Hamas' capacity to repeat October 7th\" that Israel \"has to ask whether, and especially in the absence of a plan for the day after in Gaza, further incremental gains against Hamas, but gains that may not be durable in terms of Hamas' defeat in the absence of a plan-how that stacks up against some of the, again, unintended, but horrific consequences of military action in a place where the people you're going after are so closely embedded with civilians.\"\n\nA video showing Israeli hostage Alexsander Trufanov, who was captured by Hamas on Oct. 7, was publicly released by the Hostage Families Forum on Tuesday.\n\n\"The proof of life from Alexsander (Sasha) Trufanov is additional evidence that the Israeli government must give a significant mandate to the negotiating team, which will be able to lead to a deal for the return of all the hostages - the living to rehabilitation and the murdered to burial,\" the Hostage Families Forum said in the release with the video.\n\nIsrael submitted a new cease-fire proposal to negotiators in Egypt on Monday.

The scenes of destruction & suffering of people are heart-wrenching\".\n\n\"There is a serious proposal on the table -- outlined by President Biden -- and I urge all parties to reach an agreement immediately to achieve a ceasefire and return the hostages. There is no alternative -- and any delay, every day simply costs more lives,\" he posted on X.\n\nA Palestinian woman mourns a relative killed in an Israeli strike, at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on June 2, 2024\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer earlier quoted Netanyahu as saying that the outline Biden presented was only \"partial\", and that under the plan fighting would only stop temporarily \"for the purpose of returning the hostages\".\n\nThe fighting showed no sign of easing, with the war that has devastated the coastal territory of 2.4 million people soon to enter its ninth month.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military said its forces had struck \"over 50 targets\" over the past day, and Gaza hospitals reported at least 19 fatalities in overnight strikes.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,470 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of all structures in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\n- 'This is no life' -\n\nHeavy fighting has raged especially in Gaza's far-southern Rafah area near the Egyptian border, where UN agencies say most civilians have now been displaced once more.\n\nUN and other aid agencies have warned for months of the looming risk of famine in the besieged territory amid a spiralling humanitarian crisis.\n\nA Palestinian girl carries water containers in Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip on June 3, 2024\n\nAmong bombed out buildings in the southern city of Khan Yunis, displaced Gazans were trying to remove sewage from their tents on Monday after a pipeline burst, flooding them in dirty water.\n\n\"This is no life,\" said Abdullah Barbakh.\n\n\"The sewage has flooded over us. We can't eat or drink, and we're unable to sleep. We are sleeping in the streets,\" said resident Abdul Samad Barbakh.\n\nIn northern Israel, firefighters were battling intense forest fires that broke out shortly after rocket and drone strikes from neighbouring Lebanon, forcing the partial evacuation of Kiryat Shmona.\n\nAn AFP photographer in the northeastern town saw intense blazes engulfing parts of the area bordering Lebanon, the scene of near-daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli army and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group on the sidelines of the war in Gaza.\n\nburs/mtp/ser", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" asked the US president.\n\n\"The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday told Netanyahu in a phone call that the Palestinian Authority of president Mahmud Abbas that rules parts of the occupied West Bank should \"ensure the governance\" of the Gaza Strip after the war.\n\nMacron said the proposed truce deal \"should reopen a credible perspective for the implementation of a two-state solution, the only one able to provide Israel with the necessary security guarantees and to respond to the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians\".\n\n- 'Beyond catastrophic' -\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nThe Israeli military on Monday confirmed the latest deaths of captives, naming them as Nadav Popplewell, 51, and three men in their 80s, Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger and Amiram Cooper.\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum group, which has joined a series of mass protests demanding a truce deal, said the men \"should have returned alive to their country and their families\".\n\nIsrael's bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,550 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of Gaza's structures have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\", according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\nAid group Oxfam said displaced Gazans are living in \"appalling\" conditions, with children sometimes going for a whole day without food and thousands sharing the same toilet.\n\n\"Despite Israeli assurances that full support would be provided for people fleeing, most of Gaza has been deprived of humanitarian aid, as famine inches closer,\" the aid agency said.\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk also threw his support behind the truce plan, saying of the war that \"we don't even know how to describe it anymore\".\n\n\"It is beyond precarious.

Security Council resolution that would demand an end to the war against Hamas in Gaza and the release of all hostages held by the Palestinian terrorist group, according to a draft text obtained by the Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the draft resolution, which was circulated among the 15-member council, backs President Joe Biden's May 31 ceasefire proposal to Hamas.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal without delay and without further conditions,\" Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement.\n\nThe terms of the deal laid out by Biden on Friday include a \"permanent\" end to the fighting and an Israeli withdrawal of troops from Gaza. The U.S. leader claimed he wants a future \"without Hamas in power,\" but described a series of steps that did not include the terrorist group's elimination or surrender.\n\nWhile Biden administration officials have repeatedly described the deal as an \"Israeli proposal,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that the White House's portrayal of Jerusalem's terms has not been accurate.\n\n\"I am not willing to stop the war. I will not describe the details of the deal, but what the president of the United States described is not accurate,\" Netanyahu said during a closed-door session, according to Kan News.\n\n\"We can stop the fighting for 42 days in order to return hostages, but we will not give up on total victory,\" he was said to have told lawmakers. The premier also said that Biden omitted \"other details\" in his address.\n\nA senior adviser to Netanyahu was quoted on Saturday as saying that while Jerusalem wasn't happy with the proposed terms, it was not flat-out rejecting them. \"It's not a good deal, but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them,\" said Ophir Falk, according to the British Sunday Times.\n\n\"It's a deal we agreed to,\" he stated, adding however that \"there are a lot of details to be worked out,\" including Israel's demand that there be no permanent ceasefire declared \"until all our objectives are met.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News' s \"This Week\" on Sunday, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the Biden administration expects Israel to agree to the deal if Hamas greenlights it.\n\n\"We have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal -- as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal -- that Israel would say 'Yes,'\" Kirby said.\n\nA spokesperson for Qatar's Foreign Ministry stressed on Tuesday afternoon that while Biden's suggested framework brought \"the demands of all parties closer together,\" negotiators in Doha had yet to receive \"clear positions\" from Hamas and Israel in response.", "source": {"uri": "tjpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texas Jewish Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharon_wisch_ray@tjpnews.com",

over Biden's Gaza ceasefire proposal back on table this week, sources say", "body": "Palestinian and Israeli delegations are expected to return to Egypt this week to discuss details of a deal outlined by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza, sources told The National on Tuesday.\n\nThe talks will focus on plans for the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the technical details of the Israeli army's forces in the enclave, the names of Palestinian detainees to be released, and the future governance of Gaza.\n\nOn Monday, the US said it was seeking support from the UN Security Council for the proposed ceasefire.\n\nIt sent a draft resolution stressing \"the importance of the parties adhering to the terms of the deal once agreed, with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities,\" Reuters reported.\n\nThe three-phase plan announced by Mr Biden on May 31 would involve a \"complete ceasefire\" and an increase in aid to Gaza, with the release of some of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas in the first phase.\n\nThe second phase proposes a \"permanent end to hostilities\" and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, with the rest of the hostages released, while the final phase brings in the reconstruction of Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages to their families.\n\nIsrael believes that more than a third of the remaining Gaza hostages are dead, a government tally showed on Tuesday.\n\n\"A top Israeli delegation made up of the Mossad, its domestic security sister, and the army is expected in Cairo later this week,\" said one of the sources.\n\nThe delegation is expected to bring Israel's response to a joint plan by the Palestinian Authority and Egypt for the Rafah border crossing, currently under Israeli control, and the technical details of the redeployment of forces in the first phase before the full withdrawal.\n\nIn the meantime, a delegation representing Palestinian factions - Hamas, Fatah, Islamic Jihad, and Popular Front - \"is also expected in Egypt later this week to discuss the lists of names of prisoners they want Israel to release and the future governance of Gaza,\" said the source.\n\nThe implementation of the deal will be preceded by 48 hours during which the warring parties will stands down major combat operations.\n\nThe idea is for the two parties to be reassured of the other's readiness to commit to a ceasefire, the sources said.\n\n\"Egypt and the PA are already in contact to come up with a formula for running the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing that would be acceptable to Israel before it pulls out from the Gaza side of the facility,\" said one source, adding that Egypt wants this issue sorted out before the first phase of the plan begins.\n\nAccording to the sources, Mr Biden wants his plan \"to be enforced by next week\", but \"a great deal of distrust and suspicion\" between the warring sides is hindering the process.\n\nThe proposal, which Mr Biden described as an \"Israeli proposal\", has widened the rift among members of Israel's war cabinet as it waits for a Hamas response.\n\nCentrist politicians Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot have spent recent weeks amplifying calls for elections and threats to abandon the administration, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of not setting clear objectives for the war and abandoning Israeli hostages held in Gaza.\n\nFar-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have threatened to bring down the government if Mr Netanyahu pursues anything other than a full-throttle war effort in Gaza, despite mounting international concern over the humanitarian toll.\n\nThere is also growing uncertainty among the Israel public that total victory over Hamas is possible.", "source": {"uri":

Monday's announcement heightens pressure on the Israeli government to agree to a U.S. cease-fire proposal that could secure the return of the hostages still held in Gaza and end the eight-month war.\n\nAbout 80 hostages in Gaza are believed to be alive, alongside the remains of 43 others. In the days since President Joe Biden announced the cease-fire proposal Friday, Israel has seen some of its largest protests calling on the government to bring them home. Although Biden said the proposal was Israeli, the Israeli leadership has appeared to distance itself from the plan, vowing to keep conducting military operations against Hamas until the militant group is destroyed.\n\nNewsletters", "source": {"uri": "djournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@djournal.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "julia_frankel@djournal.com", "name": "Julia Frankel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/djournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/ff/9ff92114-4c6b-5fe0-b633-d56bd0d657c6/665e21dc77978.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 473, "textEnd": 479}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-", "textStart": 198, "textEnd": 204}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

On Friday, Biden presented what he claimed to be a new Israeli proposal for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, rather than a temporary one, as part of a three-phase plan to fully end the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. (RELATED: Iran's Supreme Leader Endorses American Campus Protests, Says Students Are Part Of 'Resistance Front')\n\n\"Israel has offered a comprehensive new proposal,\" Biden told reporters on Friday. \"It's a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages.\"\n\nBut a permanent ceasefire at this stage of the war could allow Hamas, which has not been fully defeated and retains forces throughout Gaza, to regroup, return and eventually stage an attack against Israel, similar to the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 people, experts told the DCNF.\n\n\"If this war ends now and Israeli forces withdraw, let's say within six weeks or two months, then the nucleus of Hamas' presence remains, and that is going to allow the group to rearm -- and they're not just rearming on their own,\" David Daoud, senior fellow on Middle Eastern affairs the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the DCNF. \"They have allies in the region, from Iran to Hezbollah, that are going to help them rearm and regroup. And what we're going to end up with is a situation where, you know, five, definitely, 10 years, Hamas might be ready to commit another Oct. 7.\"\n\n\"This only perpetuates the cycle of violence as Hamas regroups and attacks again,\" Victoria Coates, Heritage Foundation executive and former White House national security advisor, told the DCNF. \"The only way there could be an end to all military operations in Gaza right now is if Hamas lays down their arms.\"\n\nIt is difficult to determine the exact number of casualties Hamas has sustained since it started its war against Israel on Oct. 7. Hamas was estimated to have roughly 30,000 fighters located throughout Gaza before that date; eight months into fighting, the IDF has killed more than 14,000 fighters, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's most recent estimate. (RELATED: 'Amateur Hour': Biden Admin's Floating Gaza Pier Problems Go From Bad To Worse)\n\nA bulk of the fighters are believed to be located in Rafah, the southernmost region of Gaza and the last large-scale theater for a conflict between the IDF and Hamas. Hamas and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled into Rafah after the IDF seized control of the northern and southern regions.\n\nThe Biden administration and the international community have pressured Israel not to launch a full ground assault in Rafah, citing the disproportional impact it could have on civilians. Additionally, the Biden administration believes that Israel has crippled Hamas enough to a point where massive military operations are no longer needed, a position Biden reiterated on Friday.\n\n\"At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7,\" Biden told reporters on Friday. \"I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some -- some are even in the government coalition... Well, I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes.\"\n\nEven with the damage Hamas has suffered, experts warned that too many fighters remain to ensure that the terrorist group could never stage another \"Oct. 7,\" in Biden's words. Aside from the Hamas battalions that remain in Rafah, fighters have resurged in northern and central Gaza and attacked IDF forces who took control of those regions.\n\n\"Biden is focused on this idea that Hamas doesn't have to be destroyed, that it needs to merely be degraded into that carried out another Oct. 7 style attack, and that's good enough. I think that's preposterous,\" Gabriel Noronha, executive director of Polaris National Security and former State Department official, told the DCNF. \" It's consistent with what policy, which is this obsession with preventing the destruction of our enemies. So that's what he's trying to do.\"\n\nNoronha compared Biden's proposed end to the war to his approach to Afghanistan, in which he claimed that \"al-Qaeda would not\" come back to the region after U.S. troops withdrew in 2021. Yet, Al-Qaida has since returned to Afghanistan and has established several military training camps and safe houses, maintaining a close relationship with the Taliban for protection. (RELATED: 'Did You Fall On Your Head': Biden Doesn't Answer If He'll Finish Full 4-Year Term Or Give Power To Kamala)\n\n\"Just like in Afghanistan, Biden is trying to do a timeline, political-based end to the war, to sequester involvement in the war, and not a conditions-based end,\" Noronha told the DCNF. \"It's a copy-paste into a new battlefield and environment with the same principles.\"\n\nThere's also confusion over whether the plan Biden presented on Friday was fully an Israeli proposal, as he claimed it was. Netanyahu's office said on Friday and Saturday that the \"actual\" proposal that Israel had presented would allow for a permanent ceasefire only after the \"destruction\" of Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu said until that condition is met, a ceasefire is a \"non-starter.\"\n\n\"Biden should be releasing a plan that supports our ally Israel's objective of completely destroying Hamas, but his administration unmistakably has sought to undermine it,\" Michael Bars, former White House senior communications advisor and National Security Council official, told the DCNF. \"Israel has continually maintained that it won't let terrorists off the hook in Gaza, but the proposal appears to be yet another public pressure point to achieve an outcome closer to that.\"\n\nIt isn't clear why Biden's and Netanyahu's proposals differed, but some experts mused that Biden could have been interpreting the deal in a way that favored a permanent ceasefire, which a large portion of his voting bloc has demanded he call for.\n\nThe Biden reelection campaign has been working to shore up support from Muslim communities and groups who have become increasingly frustrated with his handling of the conflict, especially in battleground states like Michigan, which has a high Arab population. Only 26% of voters approve of Biden's performance in the Israel-Hamas war as of May, compared to 60% who disapproved, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll from May 10.\n\n\"Is this a good proposal, no. The kind of deal where Hamas accepts Israel's existence, and commits to never violate its sovereignty again, and follows through with that? Anyone who thinks that's going to happen is living in a very alternate version of reality,\" Daoud said. \"Hamas is ideologically committed to Israel's destruction. There is no possibility that, as long as Hamas exists, a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Gaza will ever exist.\"\n\nThe White House National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Agreeing to such a deal is not absolute victory -- but absolute defeat. We will not allow the end of the war without the complete elimination of Hamas,\" he wrote.\n\nAccording to the terms so far made public, the deal on the table means Israel ending the war without achieving its war aim of destroying Hamas, he continued.\n\n\"Should the prime minister implement this reckless deal under the conditions published today...Otzma Yehudit will dissolve the government,\" he concluded.\n\nThe Religious Zionism-Otzma Yehudit faction holds 14 seats in the Knesset, meaning it plays a pivotal role in maintaining Netanyahu's 64-member ruling coalition, elected in November 2022.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid Party with 24 seats, earlier on Saturday repeated his pledge to provide Netanyahu with a political safety net to go ahead with the agreement. He criticized Smotrich and Ben-Gvir for their threats to collapse the government.\n\n\"The threats of Ben-Gvir and Smotrich represent the neglect of national security, of the abductees and of the residents of the north and the south,\" tweeted Lapid. \"This is the worst and most reckless government in the country's history. For them, there will be a war here forever, zero responsibility, zero management, a complete failure,\" he added.\n\nLapid said in an interview with Channel 12 on Saturday that, \"The State of Israel should make the deal presented by Biden, because the abductees are dying there [in Gaza]. They don't have time.\"\n\nNational Unity Party head and War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz called for the War Cabinet to convene as soon as possible after Biden's speech to \"formulate steps for going forward.\" Gantz has threatened to leave the emergency wartime coalition by June 8 if Netanyahu does not take a series of steps Gantz has proposed regarding the war. National Unity holds eight seats, so Gantz cannot bring down the government.\n\nMeanwhile, senior Netanyahu adviser Ophir Falk was quoted by Britain's Sunday Times on Saturday as saying that Biden's address was \"a political speech for whatever reasons.\"\n\nFalk stressed that while Jerusalem wasn't happy with the proposal, it was not rejecting it.\n\n\"It's not a good deal but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them,\" he said, according to the report.\n\n\"It's a deal we agreed to,\" he stated, adding however that \"there are a lot of details to be worked out,\" including Israel's demand that there be no permanent cease-fire declared \"until all our objectives are met.\"\n\nThese objectives have not changed since Hamas started the war on Oct. 7, he said, and include \"the release of the hostages and the destruction of Hamas as a genocidal terrorist organization.\"\n\nFor his part, Lapid said that Falk's interview proved Jerusalem had already accepted the Biden proposal. For it to retract its support now \"is a death sentence for the abductees and a crisis of trust with the Americans and the mediating countries,\" he added.\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis participated in a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday night calling on the government to accept the Biden proposal and demanding Netanyahu's resignation. Clashes broke out between protesters and police, leading to arrests.\n\nIn a joint statement on Saturday, Egypt, Qatar, and the United States called on Israel and Hamas to accept the cease-fire outline.\n\n\"As mediators in the ongoing discussions to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages and detainees, Qatar, the United States, and Egypt, jointly call on both Hamas and Israel to finalize the agreement embodying the principles outline by President Biden on May 31, 2024,\" the statement read.\n\n\"These principles brought the demands of all parties together in a deal that serves multiple interests and will bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families. This deal offers a roadmap for a permanent cease-fire and ending the crisis.\"\n\nThe terms of the proposal laid out by Biden on Friday include a permanent end to hostilities and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.\n\nSpeaking in the State Dining Room at the White House, Biden said Israel had proposed a three-phase cease-fire deal to Hamas through Egyptian, Qatari and U.S. mediators.\n\n\"For the past several months, my negotiators, of the foreign policy, intelligence community and the like, have been relentlessly focused, not just on a cease-fire that would inevitably be fragile and temporary, but on a durable end of the war,\" said Biden. \"That's been the focus -- a durable end to this war.\"\n\nThe U.S. president said he wants a future \"without Hamas in power,\" but described a series of steps that did not include the elimination of the terror group or its surrender.\n\n\"The first phase would last for six weeks,\" he said. \"Here's what it would include: a full and complete cease-fire. The withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza. Release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\"\n\nThat phase, which would also include the return of some of the remains of dead hostages and the continued daily delivery of 600 trucks of aid to the Palestinians, would lead to an indefinite period of negotiations between Israel and Hamas to end the war, he said.\n\n\"During the six weeks of phase one, Israel and Hamas would negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities,\" the president added. \"The proposal says if the negotiations take longer than six weeks from phase one, the cease-fire will still continue as long as negotiations continue.\"\n\nThe United States, Egypt and Qatar \"would work to ensure negotiations keep going until all the agreements are reached and phase two is able to begin,\" Biden added.\n\nIn the second phase, \"Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza\" and release additional Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, the president said. Quoting the text of the proposal, he said that at that point, the cease-fire would become \"the cessation of hostilities permanently.\"\n\nThe third phase would include the reconstruction of Gaza and the return of any remaining dead hostages.\n\nDuring the third phase, Biden said that the United States, Arab nations, the international community, along with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, would ensure that Hamas is not allowed to rearm.\n\nThe second and third phases are open-ended, allowing for additional negotiation, but the senior U.S. official told reporters that each is envisioned to last about 42 days.\n\nRepublished with permission from Jewish News Syndicate.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This gives them what they've been looking for, which is a cease-fire, and over time, and through the phases, the potential withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. So they ought take this deal. It's it's very forward leaning. And it's good for the people of Gaza, good for the Israeli people. And they just need to move forward on it,\" he added.\n\nThe proposal, as laid out by Biden, envisions a three-phase agreement that would culminate with a multi-year process to rebuild the badly-damaged coastal enclave, and the return of all hostages, living and dead, held in Gaza.\n\nThe first phase would start with a six-week cease-fire during which a first round of hostages held in Gaza would be released, including women, the elderly and the injured, in exchange for the release of what Biden said would be \"hundreds\" of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would also withdraw from what a senior Biden administration official called \"densely populated areas.\"\n\nNegotiators would seek to address outstanding issues during the six-week first phase, including the ratio of Palestinian prisoners that would be freed in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages. The proposal includes language allowing the cease-fire to be extended before the second phase begins so long as talks continue.\n\nThe prisoner swap ratio is a critical issue because in the second phase all living hostages would be freed, including all male Israeli military personnel.

Reuters\n\nForeign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Egypt issued a statement on Monday backing the latest diplomatic effort.\n\n'Heart-wrenching'\n\nUN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland Tuesday urged all parties to reach an agreement after he visited Gaza and \"witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of the hostilities. The scenes of destruction & suffering of people are heart-wrenching\".\n\n\"There is a serious proposal on the table -- outlined by President Biden -- and I urge all parties to reach an agreement immediately to achieve a ceasefire and return the hostages. There is no alternative -- and any delay, every day simply costs more lives,\" he posted on X.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer earlier quoted Netanyahu as saying that the outline Biden presented was only \"partial\", and that under the plan fighting would only stop temporarily \"for the purpose of returning the hostages\".\n\nThe fighting showed no sign of easing, with the war that has devastated the coastal territory of 2.4 million people soon to enter its ninth month.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military said its forces had struck \"over 50 targets\" over the past day, and Gaza hospitals reported at least 19 fatalities in overnight strikes.\n\nThis combo shows the moments before and after an Israeli air strike in Bureij, Gaza, on Monday. The war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe Palestinian group Hamas also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,470 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of all structures in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\n'This is no life'\n\nHeavy fighting has raged especially in Gaza's far-southern Rafah area near the Egyptian border, where UN agencies say most civilians have now been displaced once more.\n\nUN and other aid agencies have warned for months of the looming risk of famine in the besieged territory amid a spiralling humanitarian crisis.\n\nA Palestinian man carries a sheet containing goods from under the rubble in the Jabalia refugee camp on Monday.

We can't eat or drink, and we're unable to sleep. We are sleeping in the streets,\" said resident Abdul Samad Barbakh.\n\nIn northern Israel, firefighters were battling intense forest fires that broke out shortly after rocket and drone strikes from neighbouring Lebanon, forcing the partial evacuation of Kiryat Shmona.\n\nAn AFP photographer in the northeastern town saw intense blazes engulfing parts of the area bordering Lebanon, the scene of

Plan B was to pull back, stage ambushes and cry genocide while making up fake casualties and staging atrocities until its Islamist and leftist allies managed to save it while using hostages and their bodies as negotiating leverage.\n\nBiden, who had announced back in December that he had bailed out on supporting Israel, now announced his proposed deal that consists of 3 (actually 4) phases.\n\nLet me break down it down.\n\nPhase 1. Hamas frees some surviving female hostages and returns the bodies of the others in return for Israel releasing hundreds of terrorists. Then Hamas retakes control over populated areas in Gaza.\n\nPhase 2. Endless negotiations for the possible return of the rest of the hostages as Hamas secures its grip on Gaza once again.\n\nPhase 3: US sends billions to Hamas to \"rebuild\" Gaza in exchange for some bodies of hostages.\n\nPhase 4: Hamas plots its next attack.\n\nThe plan, presented as Israel's proposal, is really Egypt and Qatar's proposal overlaid on Israel, and now put forward by Biden and endorsed by Obama, whose people are running foreign policy in this administration.\n\nHere's what Israel and Hamas get under this plan:\n\nThe deal does not require the surrender or elimination of Hamas or, as floated previously, the departure of Hamas leaders. All Hamas has to do is return some bodies and whatever living hostages are left.\n\nTo try and make this palatable, Biden claimed:\n\n\"The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they've devastated Hamas form- -- forces over the past eight months. At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7th, which -- one of the Israelis' main objective in this war and, quite frankly, a righteous one.\"\n\nAt this point. There's a whole lot that rests on those words.\n\nNo one in the Biden administration expected that Hamas was capable of carrying out October 7th the day before it happened. No one in Israel was expecting it, either. But the one thing that is undeniably true is that the likeliest path to another October 7 is to let Hamas regroup, retake Gaza and get billions in aid to play with.\n\nBiden's proposed deal gives Hamas everything it wants and puts it on track to execute another October 7. The only way to stop that from happening is to finish Hamas.\n\nNot even Biden proposed making deals with ISIS. Yet Biden insists that Israel make a deal that will leave Hamas intact and in power. Despite his rhetoric, he's not helping Israel, he's helping Hamas.\n\nWhat is all this deal conditioned on? Qatar and Egypt. Biden claimed:\n\n\"If Hamas fails to fulfill its commitments under the deal, Israel can resume military operations. But Egypt and Qatar have assured me and they are continuing to work to ensure that Hamas doesn't do that.\"\n\nThe Biden administration will decide if Israel gets to defend itself based on assurances from Qatar, a state sponsor of Hamas, and Egypt, which was caught red-handed with tunnels leading into Rafah to Hamas.\n\nThis isn't an Israeli deal or an American deal. It's a deal by Islamic terrorists for Islamic terrorists. And Obama and Biden, two men who have done more to empower Islamic terrorists than almost anyone in the White House except Jimmy Carter, have put their seal on it. It's a bad deal for America, for Israel and for civilization.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_greenfield@jewishpress.com", "name": "Daniel Greenfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israelites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BIDEN-WH.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1708, "textEnd": 1719, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The plan is comprised of three stages in which Israel and Hamas would negotiate an exchange of captives, an eventual permanent cessation of hostilities and rebuilding of homes and public facilities.\n\nHe called on Israel and Hamas to immediately accept the deal, and quickly move towards a full resolution of the conflict. He now seeks an immediate long-term ceasefire, and links his name and reputation to achieving it.\n\nWhat are we to make of this? For starters, Biden described the proposal as an Israeli offer to Hamas, but it may well be an American initiative crediting Israel, or even a refurbished Hamas proposal from months ago dressed in American clothing to make it palatable to warmongers.\n\nThe plan is intriguing because it includes all the key drivers of the conflict, and also of its resolution: end of fighting, release of all detainees, eviction of Israel from Gaza, removal of the underlying motivation for Hamas to attack Israel, and reconstruction of the strip.\n\nHamas almost immediately responded that it viewed the proposal positively. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government responded with its usual combination of bravado and ambiguity - saying it would stop its attacks and leave Gaza only after a total victory over Hamas, even if the captives are freed. Yet Biden said that Hamas's military power has been diminished to the point where it could not repeat its October 7 assault, suggesting that Israel has achieved its goal and can now leave Gaza.\n\nWhy have both Biden and Netanyahu, the brothers-in-genocide, who until recently scoffed at longer-term ceasefire proposals, suddenly changed their minds? I have no doubt it is their common desperation. Their reputations have been dragged through the mud, and their political incumbency is threatened. Desperation is a mighty driver of political innovation.\n\nBiden fears losing the November election, while Netanyahu fears being thrown into jail for corruption by an Israeli court or for overseeing a genocide by the International Criminal Court.\n\nBiden will try to claim credit for spurring peace-making. But it is impossible to reconcile any peace-making efforts with his eight months of nonstop funding, arming, and diplomatically shielding the Israeli genocide in Gaza - openly, gleefully, proudly, and at every opportunity. He revealed his true nature, and it earned him the nickname, \"Genocide Joe\".\n\nNetanyahu is caught in the grip of irreconcilable pressures of his own making, intended to keep him in power and out of the reach of the courts. Biden's proposal is totally incompatible with the war-making frenzy of the extreme right-wing Israelis in his government. Like all politicians, but especially genocidal apartheid practitioners, he has made contradictory pledges to different audiences whom he needs to remain in power. Biden's proposal has given him a soft exit from his dilemma.\n\nWhatever dance Biden and Netanyahu may be performing for the cameras, the pull of moving forward with a plan to \"end this war and for the day after to begin\" - as the US president put it - will quickly run into serious obstacles on the path to a permanent peace. Ending the Israel-Palestine conflict involves many players who must negotiate along multiple axes, involving forces in several countries - all driven by unpredictable motives and contradictory needs.\n\nThe tensions between the following main players have to be resolved: the US and Israeli governments; Biden and Netanyahu; Netanyahu and several far-right Jewish ultranationalists in his government; the Israeli government and Israeli citizens who reject its ideology from well before October 7; the Israeli government and many Israeli citizens who support the demands of captives' families to end the war and free them; Biden and a large swath of his Democratic Party base who demand that he reverse his support for the Israeli genocide in Gaza, or they will not vote for him in November; Biden and the many Democrats and Republicans who want to continue the Israeli genocide; the US leadership, and most of the world's people and governments who support equal rights for Palestinians and Israelis and oppose the US-backed genocide; the Israeli government and Hamas whose respective core goals are nearly, but not fully, met in the Biden proposal; and the US government and Hamas who now negotiate indirectly, but remain antagonistic on most issues related to Palestine-Israel and US hegemony in the region.\n\nIf the first of the plan's three stages happens, hard negotiations will then have to tackle the toughest issues, like what form of Palestinian governance ultimately takes charge in Gaza, what security guarantees regional and global powers give Israelis and Palestinians, and how they permanently resolve the most contentious underlying issues - like ending Palestinian refugeehood, containing Zionist settler-colonialism, and peacefully coexisting as separate sovereignties in one land or adjacent states.\n\nOn the issue of Palestinian governance, Biden made an intriguing point in his Friday speech when he said that \"at this point, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7th\", meaning Israel has achieved a key goal of seriously degrading Hamas and it could now stop the war and leave Gaza.\n\nIsrael may or may not agree, but the US president may be laying the groundwork for engaging a different Hamas in a post-war era, as he did with the Taliban and his predecessors did with the Viet Cong after decades of fighting them as \"terrorists\". When wars end, amazing things happen.\n\nHamas, or an entity that mirrors its nationalistic and militant determination to exercise self-determination in Palestine, will have to be part of the new governance system in Palestine, alongside the other Palestinian factions that agree to live peacefully alongside Israel. But that will happen only if - and this is the biggest if in this entire equation - Israel and its American backers explicitly, openly, and sincerely agree to full freedom and self-determination for Palestinians, and peaceful coexistence of equally sovereign Israelis and Palestinians in historical Palestine.\n\nNow that would be a really bold move for lasting peace - if an American president one day decides to walk down that path, powered by sincerity, which is hard to discern in the current offering.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"},

Netanyahu and Biden contradicted each other, and once again, it is happening to Gaza.", "body": "Denials came from both countries regarding the ceasefire proposal offered by US President Biden to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for Gaza. White House National Security Advisor John Kirby evaluated Netanyahu's statement that there were \"some gaps\" between the draft announced by Biden and his own proposals, saying, \"As the Israeli Foreign Minister also stated, this is Israel's proposal, and we are confident that (Biden) accurately conveyed this proposal that we have been working on with the Israelis.\"\n\nThe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not agree with the assessment that there are \"gaps\" between the three-stage ceasefire proposal announced by US President Joe Biden on Friday and the proposal put forward by Israel, stating that the proposal belongs to Israel and that they are waiting for Hamas' official response.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House National Security Communications Advisor, evaluated the possible ceasefire process in Gaza and the discussions between the parties in a press briefing held via teleconference. Kirby stated that the three-stage ceasefire draft in Gaza, which President Biden announced to the public on Friday, is an \"Israeli proposal,\" but it was announced by Biden in order to explain the process more effectively to the American public and emphasize the role of the US.\n\nKirby emphasized that they worked with Tel Aviv on the agreement draft announced by Biden on Friday and that the draft belongs to Israel, stating that there were some undisclosed additional headings. Kirby stated that Hamas has been pressured to the point where it cannot launch another attack on October 7 and that pressure has been exerted on Hamas leaders in Rafah, saying, \"But now, it is time to move on to the next stage. Let's move on to the first stage, which includes a 6-week ceasefire, release some prisoners, allow 600 trucks of aid to enter Gaza, and then we can move towards a permanent ceasefire, which is the second stage.\"\n\nCommenting on Netanyahu's statement that there are \"gaps\" between the draft announced by Biden and his own proposals, Kirby said, \"I don't know which gaps you are referring to. I have seen some different statements from Israel, but as the Israeli Foreign Minister also said, this is Israel's proposal, and we are confident that (Biden) accurately conveyed this proposal that we worked on with Israelis. Therefore, I don't think there is any gap to talk about.\"\n\nKirby stated that they have always recognized Israel's \"mission\" to destroy Hamas and that they share the same view on this matter, stating that Biden's priority now is for the agreement to be accepted by the parties for the first stage, which includes a 6-week ceasefire and the release of prisoners. Kirby reminded that the initial reactions of Hamas officials to the ceasefire proposal on Friday were positive and emphasized the importance of both Israel and Hamas reaching a consensus around this agreement and starting the temporary ceasefire process as soon as possible. Saying \"The ball is in Hamas' court now, the proposal was communicated to them in writing on Thursday. They should accept it. This proposal is positive for both the people of Gaza and the people of Israel, now they need to make progress,\" Kirby expressed hope that Hamas will accept the proposal and that negotiations between the parties can pave the way for a permanent ceasefire.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu opposed the ceasefire and prisoner exchange proposal announced by President Biden, stating that it would not stop the attacks on Gaza and would only provide a temporary ceasefire for the release of Israeli prisoners. Netanyahu expressed his opposition to the ceasefire and prisoner exchange proposal announced by President Biden in his speech at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Netanyahu claimed that there are \"gaps\" between the proposal put forward by Israel and the one announced by Biden.", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Performance_and_Capacity/CPU_Saturation_Models", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Performance and Capacity/CPU Saturation Models", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://foto.haberler.com/haber/2024/06/03/israil-basbakani-netanyahu-biden-in-gazze-17394390_2296_o.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1623, "textEnd": 1632}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

All times Eastern:\n\nJun 03, 6:15 PM\n\nNetanyahu to address joint session of Congress\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will deliver an address before the two houses of the U.S. Congress, his office confirmed Monday.\n\nA date has not been set yet, his office said.\n\nPlans for Netanyahu's address come after Congressional big four leaders invited Netanyahu in a joint letter sent Friday.\n\nJun 03, 4:10 PM\n\nFour hostages confirmed dead\n\nIsraeli forces confirmed the deaths of four more hostages: Haim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popplewell.\n\nIDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said the four hostages were \"killed together\" a \"few months ago\" while \"IDF forces were operating\" in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Hagari said Israeli forces are \"examining the circumstances\" of their deaths.\n\nCooper, 85, was an economist and a poet, and a father of four and grandfather of 11, according to Kibbutz Nir Oz. His wife, Nurit Cooper, was also kidnapped and later released, the kibbutz said.\n\nMetzger, 80, was a father of three and grandfather of seven. His wife, Tamar Metzger, was also abducted to Gaza and later released, the kibbutz said.\n\nPopplewell, 51, was kidnapped with his mother, who has been released, the Hostages Families Forum said.\n\nPeri, 80, was abducted while protecting his wife, the Hostages Families Forum said. He leaves behind his wife, five children and 13 grandchildren.\n\nPeri's family said he \"heroically survived in the Hamas tunnels, under inhumane conditions, for around 4 months,\" and he \"survived with the hope and faith that the state of Israel will fulfill its moral duty to bring him home.\"\n\n\"The government of Israel and its Prime Minister have no right to leave the hostages in captivity, dismantling Israel's foundational principle of mutual responsibility,\" Peri's family said. \"We call upon the government of Israel to strive for an immediate deal, save those still alive, and bring those who are not, to a proper burial.\"\n\n\"The heartbreak that comes with this painful news should shake every citizen in the State of Israel and lead every leader to profound soul-searching,\" the Hostages Families Forum said in a statement Monday. \"The Israeli government must send out a negotiating delegation this evening and return all 124 hostages, both living and murdered. ... We reiterate our demand to the Israeli government: approve the Netanyahu deal immediately!\"\n\nJun 03, 4:05 PM\n\nBiden says Israel ready to 'move forward with the terms' of deal, Hamas is 'only obstacle'\n\nPresident Joe Biden told the emir of Qatar on Monday that Israel is ready to \"move forward with the terms\" of the hostage and cease-fire deal, according to the White House readout of the call.\n\nBiden said that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire,\" and the president \"urged [Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani] to use all appropriate measures to secure Hamas' acceptance of the deal,\" the White House said.\n\nJun 03, 3:20 PM\n\nState Department: Hamas only party blocking deal\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the current cease-fire proposal is \"nearly identical to what Hamas said it would accept just a few weeks ago,\" and said the U.S. and other mediators had not yet received an official response to the proposal from the militant group.\n\n\"The world should know, the Palestinian people should know, that the only thing standing in the way of an immediate cease-fire today is Hamas,\" Miller declared.\n\nMiller said there were some gaps between the proposal Hamas said it would agree to in the past, but added that the U.S., Qatar and Egypt all felt that they could be easily reconciled.\n\nJun 03, 2:56 PM\n\nEgypt, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE support cease-fire deal\n\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates released a joint statement Monday in support of the current cease-fire deal.\n\nThe ministers met virtually to discuss the proposal and mediation efforts to reach a deal and hostages-for-prisoners swap, as well as the sufficient entry of aid into Gaza, the statement said.\n\nThe G7 leaders also issued a statement in support of the current deal.\n\nJun 03, 1:27 PM\n\nWhite House: Biden outlined Israel's cease-fire offer accurately\n\nPresident Joe Biden outlined Israel's cease-fire proposal accurately in his Friday speech, the White House maintained Monday, pushing back on suggestions he miscommunicated the offer.\n\n\"The Israeli foreign minister himself acknowledged that this was the Israeli proposal ... and we're confident that it accurately reflects that proposal, a proposal that we worked with the Israelis on,\" White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told reporters.\n\nKirby also argued that Biden \"felt it was important\" to reveal details from ongoing cease-fire negotiations for the first time, saying it was meant to apply pressure on Hamas, not to corner Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"We don't typically go through the details of these kinds of proposals,\" Kirby said. \"But in this case, given where we are, given how much longer the hostages have now been held, given the fact that Hamas has reneged on several past occasions, on proposals that were sent to them, and given the fact that the Israelis really did work hard to come up with this proposal, and did so in good faith, the president felt it was important for the first time to publicly lay that out.\"\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister or the war cabinet,\" Kirby added. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal, how it shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nKirby said Biden delivered the speech on Friday afternoon because the deal was presented to Hamas the night before.\n\n\"We're awaiting an official response by them now to take the deal,\" Kirby said. \"This gives them what they've been looking for, which is a cease-fire and over time, and through the phases, the potential withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\"\n\n-ABC News' Fritz Farrow\n\nJun 03, 12:35 PM\n\nNetanyahu: Israel must work to bring hostages home, dismantle Hamas at same time\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has released his first public statement since President Joe Biden's Friday speech endorsing the original Israeli cease-fire deal.\n\n\"We are working in countless ways to return our abductees,\" Netanyahu said in Hebrew on Monday. \"That's why we went a long way to bring them back, but in the process of this action we maintained the goals of the war, chief among them the elimination of Hamas.\"\n\n\"We insist that we complete both this and that. It's part of the outline, it's not something I'm adding now, it's not something I'm adding because I was pressured in the coalition, it's something we unanimously agreed on in the war cabinet,\" Netanyahu added.\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled Rafah in the weeks since Israel issued evacuation orders, the local U.N. agency said Monday.\n\n\"Thousands of families now shelter in damaged & destroyed facilities in Khan Younis, where UNRWA keeps providing essential services despite increasing challenges,\" the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said in a statement.\n\nSec. of State Anthony Blinken spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Sunday about the proposal for a ceasefire-hostage deal.\n\nThe deal would secure the release of the hostages and ensure a surge in humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza.\n\n\"The Secretary commended Israel's readiness to conclude a deal and affirmed that the onus is on Hamas to accept,\" according to a readout of the call.\n\nDuring the call, Blinken also reaffirmed America's commitment to Israel's security.\n\nJun 01, 4:38 PM\n\nUS, Qatar and Egypt urge Israel and Hamas to accept deal\n\nIn a joint statement shared by the U.S. State Department on Saturday, mediators from the U.S., Egypt and Qatar said they're working to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of the hostages, and urged Hamas and Israel \"to finalize the agreement\" that President Joe Biden outlined on Friday.\n\n\"These principles brought the demands of all parties together in a deal that serves multiple interests and will bring immediate relief both to the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families,\" the statement said. \"This deal offers a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and ending the crisis.\"\n\nJun 01, 3:54 PM\n\nRight-wing Israeli ministers against deal\n\nRight-wing Israeli Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir spoke out on social media Saturday, both threatening to leave the government if the deal in its current form is accepted.\n\n\"I have now spoken with the Prime Minister and made it clear to him that I will not be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the abductees,\" Smotrich wrote.\n\nThis comes after the Hostage Families group released a statement urging Israel's parliament to embrace the deal.\n\nJun 01, 2:43 PM\n\nIsraeli government says it wasn't told Biden would mention permanent cease-fire\n\nAn Israeli government official said the Israeli Prime Minister's Office wasn't informed that President Joe Biden's Friday remarks would include a permanent end to the fighting.\n\n\"If you listen to what Biden said, you come to the impression that we agree to a permanent cease-fire without, or, without our conditions being met, and that's not the case,\" the official said.\n\nThe official said the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was informed 30 minutes before that Biden was giving a speech. The official said Netanyahu was told that the speech would focus on the hostages, with no mention of implementing a permanent cease-fire.\n\nBiden presented on Friday what he said was an Israeli proposal to draw the war in Gaza to a close.\n\nBiden said the deal had been transmitted to Israel and Hamas, through Qatar.\n\nThe president said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza [and] release of a number of hostages.\" Palestinians would also be able to return to their homes and 600 trucks of humanitarian aid would be delivered to Gaza every day.\n\nThe second phase would include a release of all remaining living hostages and the temporary cease-fire would become a permanent cease-fire with Israel withdrawing all forces from Gaza \"as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments,\" Biden said.\n\nIn phase three, there would be a major reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nEgyptian and Israeli officials will hold talks in Cairo on Sunday to discuss the reopening the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, an Egyptian security official confirmed to ABC News.\n\nThe crossing has been closed since Israeli forces took control of the Gaza side during their offensive toward Rafah in May. Egyptian officials have said they will not reopen the crossing as long as Israel controls the Gaza side.\n\nEgypt has, however, agreed to send aid trucks from its side of the border to be processed from the Israeli border checkpoint of Kerem Shalom.\n\nAlthough President Joe Biden on Friday outlined a multi-phase cease-fire proposal he said came from Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement Saturday that \"Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\n\"Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent cease-fire is put in place,\" the statement said. \"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent cease-fire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.\"\n\nBiden said Friday that Israelis should feel comfortable with a cease-fire because Hamas's capabilities have deteriorated and can no longer repeat the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks.\n\nHamas in a statement reiterated its requirements for a deal. Hamas said it \"affirms its position of readiness to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent cease-fire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction, the return of the displaced to all their places of residence, and the completion of a serious prisoner exchange deal.\"\n\nMay 31, 5:15 PM\n\nCongressional leaders formally invite Netanyahu to deliver joint address\n\nThe four leaders of the House of Representatives and Senate formally invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to deliver a joint address to Congress.\n\nThe letter sent on Friday by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did not provide a date with the address.\n\nThe congressional leaders asked Netanyahu to \"share the Israeli government's vision for defending democracy, combatting terror, and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.\"\n\n\"The existential challenges we face, including the growing partnership between Iran, Russia, and China, threaten the security, peace, and prosperity of our countries and of free people around the world,\" the letter read.\n\nNetanyahu last addressed Congress in 2015.\n\nMay 31, 4:03 PM\n\nIsrael 'united' in desire to return hostages, Netanyahu responds to Biden\n\nHours after President Joe Biden outlined a three-phase cease-fire deal to end the Israel-Hamas war and said it is time to bring the hostages home, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded, saying its government is \"united in the desire to return abductees.\"\n\n\"The Israeli government is united in the desire to return our abductees as soon as possible and is working to achieve this goal,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement Friday.\n\n\"The Prime Minister authorized the negotiating team to present an outline for achieving this goal, while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our abductees and the elimination of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities,\" Netanyahu's office added.\n\nMay 31, 2:07 PM\n\nBiden pitches three-phase cease-fire deal to end Israel-Hamas war\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave remarks from the White House on Friday, pitching a new plan to draw the war in Gaza to a close.\n\nBiden said the deal had been transmitted to Israel and Hamas, through Qatar.\n\nThe president said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza [and] release of a number of hostages.\" Palestinians would also be able to return to their homes and 600 trucks of humanitarian aid would be delivered to Gaza every day.\n\nThe second phase would include a release of all remaining living hostages and the temporary cease-fire would become a permanent cease-fire with Israel withdrawing all forces from Gaza \"as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments,\" Biden said.\n\nIn phase three, there would be a major reconstruction of Gaza.\n\n\"At this point Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7, which was one of the Israelis' main objectives in this war, and, quite frankly, a righteous one,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden continued, \"We can't lose this moment. Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory ... will only bog down Israel in Gaza -- draining the economic, military and human resources and furthering Israel's isolation in the world. That will not bring hostages home.\"\n\nMay 31, 1:22 PM\n\nHamas releases audio from Israeli hostage Noa Argamani\n\nHamas has released a video containing audio from hostage Noa Argamani with images of her drawings over the audio.\n\nAlongside her voice, in which she pleads to be saved, drawings are shown, which the family believes to be scribbles that Argamani has drawn.\n\nAgramani was seen in a widely shared video being abducted from the Nova music festival on a motorbike.\n\nThe 26-year-old was last heard from in a video released by Hamas in January.\n\nThe Hostage Families Forum, which said the family approved release of the video, said in a statement, \"125 men and women have been held hostage by Hamas for 238 days. The Israeli government must hear the call and act decisively, without the need for any propaganda video from Hamas, to swiftly reach a deal to bring the hostages home!\"\n\nThe Israeli army is now operating in central Rafah, the IDF said Friday.\n\n\"The operation continues to gradually evolve, with forces focusing on uprooting Hamas terror infrastructure on the Philadelphi route as well as special forces that are conducted intelligence-based targeted-raids from the outskirts of Central Rafah,\" the IDF said in a statement.\n\nThe IDF said it found dozens of Hamas tunnels and rocket launchers. Israel also said it \"eliminated hundreds of terrorists along the Philadelphi route and the outskirts of the Urban areas of Rafah.\"\n\nMay 30, 3:39 PM\n\nBenny Gantz's party proposes vote to dissolve Israeli parliament\n\nIsraeli war cabinet Minister Benny Gantz's centrist party has proposed holding a parliamentary vote on dissolving the Knesset, but it is unclear whether he has enough support to bring about early elections.\n\nThe chairman of the Israel Beytenu party, Avigdor Lieberman (from the opposition), is holding a political dialogue with former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, aiming to create a political union that could serve as a \"governing alternative\" to the Likud and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\n-ABC News' Will Gretsky\n\nMay 30, 2:44 PM\n\nHamas says they will agree to cease-fire deal when Israel agrees to stop war in Gaza\n\nHamas released a new statement about the proposed cease-fire deal, saying if Israel agreed to \"stop its war and aggression\" in Gaza, they would \"reach a complete agreement that includes a comprehensive exchange deal,\" Hamas said in the statement.\n\n\"Today, we informed the mediators of our clear position that if the occupation stops its war and aggression against our people in Gaza, our readiness to reach a complete agreement that includes a comprehensive exchange deal,\" Hamas added.\n\nIsrael had said it submitted a cease-fire proposal to Hamas earlier this week and was awaiting the group's review of the deal. Israel officials then said that they expect the war in Gaza to last until the end of this year.\n\n-ABC News' Diaa Ostaz\n\nMay 30, 2:44 PM\n\nEgyptian source denies Israeli claim of tunnels in the Philadelphi corridor\n\nA high-level Egyptian source denied Israeli reports about the existence of tunnels on the Egyptian border with Gaza, Egyptian state-run Al-Qahera News said.\n\nThe source dismissed the reports as \"lies\" promoted by Israel to \"cover up its military failure.\" It added that there were \"no communications with the Israeli side\" regarding the allegations.\n\nThere has been no official comment from Cairo since the announcement.\n\nEgypt has over the past decade destroyed hundreds of smuggling tunnels along its eastern border with Gaza as part of its fight against Islamist militants in its border Sinai region.\n\nEgyptian officials have said a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi, a largely demilitarized buffer zone along the Gaza-Egypt border, could violate the 1979 peace deal between Egypt and Israel.\n\n-ABC News' Ayat Al-Tawy\n\nMay 30, 12:24 PM\n\nGaza pier built by US Army expected to be working again within a week\n\nThe damaged components of the U.S. pier built to funnel aid into Gaza are back at the Port of Ashdod undergoing repairs, a U.S. official confirmed to ABC News.\n\nThe system is expected to be back in operation on Gaza's coast within a week, the official said.\n\n-ABC News' Matt Seyler\n\nMay 29, 4:25 PM\n\nEvidence indicates weapons used in deadly Rafah strike are US-made: Experts\n\nEvidence indicates a weapon used by Israel in the Rafah strike -- that killed 50 people and injured 249 others -- on May 26 appears to be made by a U.S.-owned company, two weapons experts who reviewed photos and video of fragments at the site told ABC News.\n\nWeapon fragments seen in video are consistent with a U.S.-made \"small diameter bomb,\" which includes the GBU-39/B, or B/B. These types of SDB/GBU-39 weapons can carry a 37 pound warhead, consistent with statements from the IDF about what weapons were used in the strike, Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordinance disposal specialist, said.\n\n\"We used two small rockets, 17 kg warhead, that were fired from aircraft to hit, precisely. We've used this kind of ammunition before,\" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told ABC News when asked about what weapons were used in the strike.\n\nBall identified a series of numbers beginning with \"81873'' marked on one fragment seen in video reviewed by ABC News. This is the Commercial and Government Entity Code, or CAGE Code, assigned by the U.S. government to aerospace manufacturing company Woodward, based in Colorado, according to U.S. government records.\n\nA second former U.S. military explosive ordinance disposal specialist confirmed the fragments were consistent with the GBU-39, but asked to not be named by ABC News.\n\nAll sales of GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs to foreign entities require the State Department's approval, but a U.S. official says Israel may have also procured the munitions through direct commercial sales that don't meet the value threshold -- $25 million in Israel's case -- for congressional review and public notification.\n\nIn the days following the Oct. 7 attack, Israel rushed to back up its stockpiles, including its supply of the small diameter bombs by any available means, the official said. ABC News has not confirmed if the weapons Israel received after Oct. 7 were used in the May 26 Rafah strike.\n\nWhen asked if the bombs used in the strike were provided by the U.S., deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said reporters needed to ask the Israelis during a briefing on May 28.\n\n-ABC News' Chris Looft, Helena Skinner, Britt Clennett, Sohel Uddin, Luis Martinez, Matt Seyler, Shannon Crawford, Ellie Kaufman and Camilla Alcini\n\nMay 29, 3:50 PM\n\nWorld Central Kitchen suspends operations in Rafah over safety\n\nWorld Central Kitchen has suspended its humanitarian efforts in Rafah due to safety concerns. Jose Andre's aid group had restarted their relief efforts in Gaza after seven aid workers were killed by an Israeli strike, sparking international outrage over the protection of civilians in Gaza.\n\nThe group will continue to operate elsewhere in Gaza.\n\n\"In the face of Israeli operations in Rafah, countless families are being forced to flee once again. Ongoing attacks have forced us to pause work at our main kitchen in Rafah and relocate many of our community kitchens further north. The situation is dire but WCK's Palestinian team -- all directly impacted by the war -- is showing up every day to support neighbors in need,\" WCK said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"Yesterday we provided almost 100,000 meals and will increase capacity this week as 58 of our aid trucks have entered Gaza since Sunday,\" WCK said.\n\nIsrael expects that the war in Gaza will likely be long, lasting for at least seven more months of fighting against Hamas, a senior Israeli official said Wednesday.\n\n\"We expect another seven months of combat in order to shore up our achievement and realize what we define as the destruction of Hamas and Islamic Jihad's military and governing capabilities,\" Tzachi Hanegbi, the head of the Israeli national security council, said in a radio interview to Kann News.\n\n-ABC News' Dana Savir\n\nMay 29, 2:21 PM\n\nIsrael has 'tactical control' over Philadelphi corridor in Gaza: IDF\n\nIsraeli Defense Forces have \"tactical control over the Philadelphi corridor\" in Gaza, an IDF official told reporters Wednesday.\n\n\"IDF has tactical control over the Philadelphi corridor, which does mean it doesn't mean that we have boots on the ground across all of the corridor, but it means that we can control and we have the ability to cut off the oxygen line that Hamas has used for replenishing and movement in and around that area,\" the IDF official said.\n\nAfter comments from Israeli officials predicted the war in Gaza would last through the end of the year, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby expressed a desire to reach an end much sooner than that -- \"as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll let the defense minister speak for his own views and opinions. Our view, in our opinion, is we gotta get this hostage deal now. The time is now to do it -- to get that temporary cease-fire and to end this conflict as soon as possible,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"I can tell you that President Biden is committed to seeing that we find a way to end this conflict. And to end as soon as practicable.\"\n\nKirby confirmed that there is a \"fresh\" proposal on the table that the Israels are \"fully supportive of,\" but it is too \"fresh\" to provide details on. He emphasized that the Biden administration still believes there is a path for a cease-fire deal that could \"lead to something more sustainable\" and a \"potential end of the conflict.\"\n\nKirby also said the fighting \"could end tomorrow if Mr. Sinwar did the right thing and agreed to this deal,\" referring to the Hamas leader.\n\n-ABC News' Cheyenne Haslett\n\nMay 29, 1:30 PM\n\nBlinken reacts to 'horrific' Rafah strike, questions whether Israeli gains are worth consequences\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke about the catastrophic strike over the weekend in Rafah -- becoming the first top-level U.S. official to publicly respond to the attack in detail.\n\n\"The incident a couple days ago was horrific,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone who has seen the images cannot be deeply affected by them, just on a basic human level.\"\n\nBlinken was also asked about reports indicating that the U.S. supplied the weapons used in the strike; he said he couldn't yet say where they came from, but if Israel's claims that it used small diameter munitions were true, the incident illustrated how even precision attacks could cause immense damage to civilians in Rafah.\n\n\"I think we also see that even limited, focused, targeted attacks, designed to deal with terrorists who've killed innocent civilians that are plotting to kill more -- even those kinds of operations can have terrible, horrific, unintended consequences,\" he said.\n\nBlinken then said it was \"very important in this moment after Israel has had real success in helping to destroy Hamas' capacity to repeat October 7th\" that Israel \"has to ask whether, and especially in the absence of a plan for the day after in Gaza, further incremental gains against Hamas, but gains that may not be durable in terms of Hamas' defeat in the absence of a plan-how that stacks up against some of the, again, unintended, but horrific consequences of military action in a place where the people you're going after are so closely embedded with civilians.\"\n\nA video showing Israeli hostage Alexsander Trufanov, who was captured by Hamas on Oct. 7, was publicly released by the Hostage Families Forum on Tuesday.\n\n\"The proof of life from Alexsander (Sasha) Trufanov is additional evidence that the Israeli government must give a significant mandate to the negotiating team, which will be able to lead to a deal for the return of all the hostages - the living to rehabilitation and the murdered to burial,\" the Hostage Families Forum said in the release with the video.\n\nIsrael submitted a new cease-fire proposal to negotiators in Egypt on Monday.

That's why we're investigating it. It's a tragic event and it's not the way we operate. We are fighting with Hamas terrorists. We are trying to kill them specifically in a very precise way, intelligence based. And that's why we look at this as a tragic incident that shouldn't have happened,\" Shoshani said.\n\nOver 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic mishap\" on Monday.\n\n\"The mishap was the fire that carried out after the targeted attack, and we are looking into why this fire caught on,\" Shoshani said. \"The attack, per se, was according to procedure, with surveillance before the attack, a very precise attack based on intelligence.\"\n\n-ABC News' Britt Clennett\n\nMay 28, 3:27 PM\n\nBarely any medical facilities functioning, Palestinian Ministry of Health says\n\nThere are barely any functioning medical facilities in Rafah as the Israel Defense Forces continue its operations, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Tuesday.\n\n\"Both the Indonesian field hospital and the Tal Al-Sultan Clinic in Rafah Governorate have ceased service, leaving only the Tal Al-Sultan Maternity Hospital struggling to survive and continue providing service to patients in Rafah,\" according to the ministry.\n\nIsrael put forward a new cease-fire proposal and hostage release deal on Monday, which has now been passed on to Hamas, an Egyptian security source told ABC News.\n\nMediators are awaiting a response from Hamas within 24 hours, the source said.\n\nThis is the first time Israel has taken the first move to submit a draft proposal since the war began, according to the source.

The U.S. is in the process of understanding what has happened, waiting for Israel to conduct its own investigation and determining what action to take next, according to the official.\n\nThe U.S. maintains that while they've warned about a major ground offensive in Rafah, that's not what's happening, according to the official.\n\nMay 27, 3:37 PM\n\nHamas leader says Rafah strike shows Israel is defying international law\n\nCommenting on the Rafah strike that killed 50 people, Hamas released a statement saying Israel's attack on Rafah is like \"the announcement of Netanyahu's government's defiance of international justice decisions,\" referring to the International Court of Justice's decision last week ordering Israel to stop its operation in Rafah.\n\n\"The massacre committed in the areas where its considered safe area,\" Hamas leader Osama Hamdan said. \"The timing of these murders during the last two days is like the announcement of Netanyahu's government's defiance of international justice decisions.\"\n\nMay 27, 6:17 PM\n\nNetanyahu calls strike on Rafah a 'tragic mishap'\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike on Rafah which killed at least 50 Palestinians Sunday, a \"tragic mishap,\" in a speech to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, Monday.\n\n\"We are fighting with force in the north of the Gaza Strip, in its center, its south and in Rafah.

Biden's Gaza Cease-Fire Proposal", "body": "Saudi foreign minister receives phone call from his US counterpart.\n\nThe top diplomats of Saudi Arabia and the US discussed on Tuesday a Gaza cease-fire proposal laid out by US President Joe Biden.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan received a phone call from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during which they explored the latest developments in Gaza, and Biden's proposal for a cease-fire and hostage swap between Hamas and Israel, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nOn Friday, Biden said Israel presented a three-phase deal that would end hostilities in Gaza and secure the release of hostages held in the coastal enclave.\n\nThere was no official response yet from Israel or Hamas on the proposal, but the Palestinian group said that it would \"respond positively to any proposal that includes a permanent cease-fire, a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction efforts, the return of the displaced, and the completion of a comprehensive hostage exchange deal.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said Monday that he was \"not ready to stop\" the war in Gaza, claiming that Biden's remarks about a cease-fire proposal were \"inaccurate.\"\n\nHis coalition partners, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have threatened to topple the government if Netanyahu agrees to Biden's cease-fire plan.\n\nIndirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt, have so far failed to agree on a permanent cease-fire.\n\nIsrael has continued its brutal offensive on Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nMore than 36,500 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, the vast majority being women and children, and nearly 83,000 others injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nNearly eight months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which in its latest ruling has ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its operation in the southern city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.\n\n*Writing by Mohammad Sio -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Israeli prime minister said any deal that did not lead to the complete destruction of Hamas's military and governing capacity would be a \"non-starter\".\n\nThe Israeli prime minister told the Knesset on Monday: \"The claims that we have agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met are incorrect.\"\n\n\"I've heard different statements coming out of Israel,\" Kirby said, pointing out that the country's foreign minister, Israel Katz, had acknowledged that it was an Israeli proposal. The three-phase plan outlined by Biden on Friday, he added, \"accurately reflects that proposal that we worked with the Israelis on\".\n\n\"Hamas has now got this proposal. It got it Thursday night. We're awaiting an official response by them,\" Kirby said. \"They ought to take the deal. This gives them what they've been looking for, which is a ceasefire and over time, through phases, the potential withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\"\n\n\"It is fair to say that the ball is in Hamas's court,\" he said.\n\nUS officials said that the proposal had evolved in discussions between US, Israeli and Qatari negotiators in the past few weeks. However, Netanyahu was given just a few hours' notice on Friday that Biden would make it public.\n\nThe officials said that the timing, with Biden speaking when Israeli government offices were closed for the Sabbath and the country's most conservative, religiously observant politicians had cut themselves off from the internet and other communications, was not deliberate, but was dictated by the fact that the four and a half page plan was delivered to Hamas on Thursday.\n\nIt was transmitted to the Hamas political leadership based in Qatar but officials said it could take time for it to be conveyed to Yahya Sinwar, the group's leader in Gaza, and for a reply to come back from him.\n\nThe first phase of the proposal would be similar to an earlier plan that failed to win agreement. Over six weeks, Hamas would release elderly, sick, wounded and female hostages, and Israel would free a greater number of Palestinian detainees. There would be a ceasefire and Israeli forces would pull back from densely populated areas, allowing Palestinians to go back to whatever is left of their homes, and 600 trucks of humanitarian assistance would cross into the coastal strip each day.\n\nAt the same time there would be negotiations on how to reach a second, more comprehensive, phase, which would involve the release of all remaining hostages and the freeing of more Palestinian prisoners, a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and a permanent cessation of hostilities. A third phase would address reconstruction and governance in Gaza.--agencies", "source": {"uri": "nna-leb.gov.lb", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0625\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shabbat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orthodox Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/bundles/frontendwebsite/images/image-placeholder.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

John Fetterman (D-PA)\n\n\"Netanyahu's intention now to belittle the president, who did the unbelievable for Israel in the current war, two months before the election date in the United States, is an attempt to thwart Biden in order to pave the way for Trump to win the election. Trump in return will let Netanyahu continue to perpetuate the war and especially his chair, along with the huge prices we will have to pay. First and foremost, slamming the door to the end of the war in Gaza, leaving the war of attrition in the north, erasing the chance to return the abductees and a funeral ceremony for the regional deal with Saudi Arabia.\" Maj. Gen. [res] Yisrael Ziv wrote.\n\nThe negotiations between \"Israel\" and Hamas have hit a roadblock as Hamas officials express dissatisfaction with the one-sided terms from \"Israel,\" Wall Street Journal reports. According to statements made to mediators, Hamas has not seen an Israeli proposal that aligns with the vision outlined by US President Biden. While acknowledging the seriousness of Biden's ideas, Hamas is seeking a detailed written proposal that aligns with his description and ensures a comprehensive and enduring ceasefire, as conveyed by Arab mediators.\n\nSenior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad criticized \"Israel\" for not being serious about negotiating a ceasefire. Meanwhile, Hamas's chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, appears to be in no rush to end the war, believing it is strategically advantageous for the goal of liberation. However, Hamas's political bureau leaders are reportedly eager to reach a resolution, provided it guarantees the group's recognition and continued governance of Gaza. Hamas has gained confidence in its ability to withstand \"Israel's\" campaign, particularly with growing international condemnation over Israeli genocidal actions in Rafah. But indirect negotiations have stalled primarily due to disagreements over whether an initial temporary ceasefire would lead to a permanent end to the war.\n\nThe most recent Israeli proposal received by Hamas described a period of \"sustainable calm\" in ambiguous terms, which has further complicated negotiations. Hamas remains wary of trusting \"Israel\" without written guarantees, though achieving this seems challenging given the current political climate in \"Israel,\" an observer told WSJ.\n\n\"As laid out in President Biden's speech, the initial terms of the proposed deal include a disturbing imbalance in who guarantees that Hamas and Israel fulfill their commitments under the agreement -- a problem that should be fixed now rather than later.\" according to Robert Satloff is the Segal Executive Director of The Washington Institute. \"Egypt and Qatar have shown themselves to be woefully incapable of influencing Hamas over the past eight months, so the idea that there is any value in their \"assurances\" regarding the group's future behavior is risible. By contrast, any U.S. administration necessarily has considerable leverage on Israel's actions given... Washington and Jerusalem will almost inevitably disagree in their judgment of what constitutes an actionable Hamas violation. Indeed, the group will likely ready itself to engineer such a clash at a moment of heightened instability on another Israeli front...\"\n\nIn a TV report by Channel 12 on Monday evening, the ambiguously worded Clause 14 in Israel's latest hostage deal proposal has been identified as the central point of contention between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden. This follows Netanyahu's statement to the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, asserting that \"the proposal that [U.S. President Joe] Biden presented is incomplete,\" and highlighting \"gaps\" between the Israeli version and Biden's interpretation.\n\nClause 14, concerning the transition from Phase 1's ceasefire to Phase 2's permanent cessation, reads: \"All the processes on which there is agreement in Phase 1 of the deal, including the cessation of military activities by both sides and the other summaries, will continue in Phase 2, as long as the negotiations on implementing Phase 2 continue.\" Clause 14, concerning the transition from Phase 1's ceasefire to Phase 2's permanent cessation, reads: \"All the processes on which there is agreement in Phase 1 of the deal, including the cessation of military activities by both sides and the other summaries, will continue in Phase 2, as long as the negotiations on implementing Phase 2 continue.\"\n\nBiden emphasized in his address, \"If Hamas fails to fulfill its commitments under the deal, Israel can resume military operations.\" Netanyahu, speaking in a closed-door Knesset committee session, reiterated Israel's intention to resume military operations at the end of Phase 1, which Channel 12's source suggests could provoke Hamas's Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar to derail the deal.\n\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stressed the positive aspects of the ceasefire proposal for Israel, while there were conflicting statements about Tel Aviv's position on the proposal. The US State Department said early Monday that Blinken held two separate calls with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and War Council Minister Benny Gantz regarding the ceasefire agreement proposal that President Joe Biden revealed last Friday. The ministry added in a statement that the Foreign Minister told Gallant that the agreement includes greater integration of Israel in the region and enhances its security interests in the long term.\n\nIn a separate call, Blinken reviewed with Gantz the security benefits for Israel if it agreed to the proposal, which is essentially Israeli. The US State Department stated that Blinken stressed to the Israeli War Council member that Hamas must accept the proposal without delay.\n\nA statement issued by the Israeli Ministry of Defense said that Gallant assured the US Secretary of State that the war \"will not stop until the kidnappers are returned and an alternative rule is found for Hamas in Gaza,\" according to what Al-Hurra's correspondent in Israel reported. The statement stated that Gallant referred to \"moves being made to overthrow Hamas and establish an alternative rule for it.\" For its part, the US State Department stated that Blinken discussed with Gallant and Gantz the proposal aimed at achieving a complete and comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza as part of a deal on the release of the hostages, which guarantees the release of all of them and increases the amount of humanitarian aid that reaches various parts of Gaza. Blinken praised Israel's readiness to conclude a deal, considering that Hamas \"now bears responsibility for approving the proposal.\"\n\nYesterday, the Coordinator for Strategic Affairs at the US National Security Council, John Kirby, expressed Washington's hope that Hamas would agree to the proposal and begin implementing its first phase. Kirby added in an interview with the American ABC network that while the first phase of the agreement, which extends for 6 weeks, is being implemented without fighting, Hamas and Israel will negotiate the implementation of the second phase. The American official also said that if Hamas agrees to the proposal announced by President Joe Biden, all expectations of the US administration indicate that Israel will agree to it in turn.\n\nThe Hamas movement announced that it was dealing positively with the ideas presented by the US President and considered them a general framework, and stressed the necessity of achieving this by reaching a complete agreement that includes a ceasefire, Israeli withdrawal, and relief and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.\n\nMeanwhile, last night, the Israeli War Council held a meeting to discuss the possible exchange deal, amid conflicting news about Tel Aviv's position on the proposal on the table to conclude an agreement after the US President announced its details. At a time when the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation said that the Israeli negotiating team withheld the details of the proposal from the Ministerial Council for fear of its contents being leaked, the American CBS network quoted an Israeli official as saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the War Council had agreed to the proposal but were waiting for Hamas' response. However, the Broadcasting Corporation reported, in return, that Netanyahu promised his coalition partners that there would be no end to the war, and it also said that the Prime Minister's statements confirm that he will not agree to a permanent ceasefire without fulfilling the conditions.\n\nIt revealed that Netanyahu informed his coalition partners that the chances of reaching an agreement with Hamas are low, and that US President Joe Biden did not present the real conditions that Israel agreed to within the framework of the negotiations.\n\nFor its part, Israeli Channel 13 quoted high-ranking officials in the Likud Party led by Netanyahu, that the latter would not be able to pass the agreement proposal announced by Biden, because this step would lead to the collapse of the government, and that if Hamas responded positively to the proposal, Netanyahu will find a way to evade or delay through conflicting statements or repeating what he has already agreed to. In this context, Israeli Channel 7 quoted National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir threatening again that if Netanyahu continued on the path of concluding the deal, he would dissolve the government. Other members of the government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, made a similar threat.\n\nRegarding the discussions within the War Council, which approved the Israeli proposal, Israeli Channel 12 quoted its officials as saying that the Council is studying the proposal that Israel not wait for Hamas' response, and take proactive steps to ensure a deal is reached. The channel said that officials of the War Council will propose starting talks and taking steps in terms of humanitarian aid. According to the same source, officials in the war council expressed their fear that efforts to reach a deal would be harmed while waiting for Hamas' response.\n\nRegarding the Israeli movement demanding the release of prisoners, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported that protesters gathered last night in front of the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in occupied Jerusalem, to demand the conclusion of the exchange deal revealed by the American President. Demonstrators also gathered in Tel Aviv, raising banners reading \"Deal Now\" and other banners bearing pictures of Israeli prisoners in Gaza. For its part, Israeli Army Radio said that residents of the Nir Oz settlement, from which 77 people were detained on October 7, called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to approve the swap deal proposal.\n\nThe Associated Press also quoted family members of Israeli prisoners as saying that time is running out and that the proposed deal may be the last chance, and they called on the Israeli leadership not to disappoint them. The families of the prisoners accused the Israeli government of doing too much to delay reaching an agreement, which cost the lives of many hostages. The Israeli government estimates the number of detainees in Gaza at about 125, and it has announced the recovery of the bodies of a number of prisoners who were killed during the past eight months.\n\nIsraeli media quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying that what US President Joe Biden presented regarding the deal proposal was not accurate, refusing to agree to stop the war on the Gaza Strip before achieving its goals. Netanyahu said - according to what was reported by the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation - that he \"will not review the details of the deal, but what Biden presented is not accurate and there are details that have not been revealed.\"\n\nHe added, \"We can stop the fighting for 42 days to return the hostages, but we will not give up absolute victory.\" Likewise, he was quoted by the Israel Today newspaper, where he said, \"Israel can stop the fighting to return the kidnapped people, but it cannot stop the war.\" Channel 12 also quoted him as saying, \"Biden presented only part of the broad outlines of the deal, and we will not stop the war without achieving its goals,\" adding that the number of abductees who will be released in the first phase of the deal has not yet been determined.\n\nIn this context, the Israeli Broadcasting Authority reported, citing informed sources, that the War Council discussed the possibility of sending the negotiating delegation to Cairo, to continue contacts with the mediators. The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation added that the War Council decided to wait until a positive response was received from the mediators before sending the delegation.\n\nWhite House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said on Monday that the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) said it received President Joe Biden's speech \"positively\" and should agree to a ceasefire agreement with Israel, while 5 Arab countries supported the efforts. Mediation to end the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip . Kirby added that the current Israeli proposal is the result of intense diplomatic efforts between the United States and Israel, and that the ball is now in Hamas' court, refusing to reveal the nature of the minor gaps between the two parties.\n\nIn response to a question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements , Kirby said that he was not aware of any gaps between the United States and Israel, reiterating Washington's support for what he called \"Israel's right and responsibility to pursue Hamas leaders.\" Kirby confirmed that the second phase will include the release of the rest of the prisoners and detainees, after which the temporary ceasefire will turn into a permanent cessation of hostilities, noting that the next day in Gaza is not part of the proposal presented to Hamas, but work is underway on that.\n\nIn turn, the US State Department said that the ceasefire agreement was presented to Hamas last Thursday, \"and we have not yet received a response,\" indicating that it is \"completely\" confident that Israel will agree to it, and that the proposal was Israeli, and was developed in consultation with the United States, Qatar, and Egypt. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stressed the \"positives\" of the ceasefire proposal for Israel, with Washington expressing its hope that Hamas would agree to the proposal and begin implementing its first phase.\n\nFormer Israeli military intelligence officer Michael Milstein ruled out that Israel would succeed in finding a local alternative to replace Hamas as the ruling authority in the Gaza Strip , pointing to previous failed attempts. The Associated Press quoted Milstein, an analyst specializing in Palestinian affairs at Tel Aviv University, as saying that there are no local actors bold enough to present themselves as an alternative to Hamas to run the Strip.\n\nCommenting on statements in this regard by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, he added that the wishes expressed by the latter would be tantamount to a \"suicide mission\" for any local leader in Gaza. He continued that although Hamas suffered severe damage during the past eight months, its influence on the people of the Gaza Strip remains strong. The former Israeli intelligence officer pointed out the failure of attempts made by Israel in the 1970s and 1980s to impose a governance model like the one it seeks now by empowering tribal entities or local leaders, and these attempts ended tragically, as he put it. Milstein said that those who accept cooperation will be considered agents by the Palestinians, adding that unless Israel maintains a permanent presence in Gaza, these \"alternative forces\" that it is trying to form to replace Hamas will be extremely fragile.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant said yesterday, Sunday, that the Israeli government will not accept Hamas rule at the end of the war, and that it is working to find an alternative to the movement. Galant added that in parallel with the military action, it is important for the security establishment to prepare a governmental alternative to Hamas, saying that work is being done on the ground and in other ways to dismantle Hamas' military and governmental capabilities, and that this achieves Israel's goals and returns the detainees in Gaza.\n\nLast March, sources told Al Jazeera that the notables of the Gaza families rejected an offer from Israel to cooperate with it, and at that time Abu Salman Al-Mughni - one of the notables - stated that the tribes could not accept being an alternative to the government and to whomever the people chose.\n\nHossam Badran , a member of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), said that the movement has not received any new paper for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, and the proposal presented by the mediators on May 6, and agreed upon by Hamas and the resistance factions, is the approved position. Badran added, \"US President Joe Biden's speech regarding negotiations to end the war on Gaza indicates that the occupation and its main supporters are in a state of confusion, because they bet on the defeat of our people and the defeat of their resistance, and this did not happen.\"\n\nHe pointed out that Biden's statement acknowledged, in one way or another, that the occupation is unable to achieve any of its political and military goals, which it announced over the past months, pointing out that the United States has the tools and ability to put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to stop the war, because they are the ones who are abstaining of reaching any agreement. Badran stressed that Netanyahu is the only party that has obstructed reaching any agreement, and wants the war to continue for personal and partisan reasons, and is ignoring the regional and international position, which is almost unanimous in stopping it.\n\nHe said that Netanyahu's statements contained something of an answer to Biden's speech that he did not want to move towards any practical agreement, stressing that \"the basic guarantee for implementing any agreement is our strength in the field as a people and resistance.\" He stressed that the resistance will not allow the occupation to have any role in arranging our internal affairs, whether the situation inside Gaza or dealing with the crossings in general, especially the Rafah crossing, indicating that the occupation must withdraw from the Rafah crossing and this is a matter of Palestinian consensus, and the previous administration of the crossing must return. As for arranging the Palestinian situation, this is an internal matter that we Palestinians manage without agreeing to any regional or international pressure.\n\nQatar, Egypt and the United States - in their capacity as mediators in the ongoing discussions to ensure a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages and detainees - called on both Hamas and Israel to conclude an agreement that embodies the principles outlined by Biden in the speech of May 31, 2024, according to a joint statement on Saturday. Those principles that Biden spoke about include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas in the Gaza Strip, and the release of detainees, including women, the elderly, and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid into the Strip, according to what a Qatari Foreign Ministry statement said on Saturday.\n\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said that the currently proposed proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the introduction of aid into the Strip deserves acceptance, adding that his country is awaiting the Israeli response to this proposal after the Hamas movement announced that it received the proposal positively. Shoukry continued, during a press conference with his Spanish counterpart in Madrid, that Egypt is motivating \"the two conflicting parties\" to accept the proposed plan, and that Egypt continues to communicate and coordinate with its partners to end the \"war\" that caused the \"killing\" of 37,000 Palestinians, the majority of whom are women and children .\n\nShukry added that Egypt is looking forward to resolving the Palestinian issue on the basis of the two-state solution and establishing the Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with \"East Jerusalem\" as its capital, noting that what is happening in Gaza is troubling Egypt due to the humanitarian damage, pointing out that \"Israel's\" practices violate the rules of international law, and that The war in Gaza exposes the region to chaos .\n\nIn response to a question about the Israeli presence near the Egyptian border, he explained that the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip is rejected by most international powers, and that the connection of this presence to the Rafah crossing is rejected by Egyptian policy, stressing that the crossing represents a major means of communication between Egypt and Gaza to bring in aid and rescue the wounded.\n\nRegarding the \"peace\" treaty between Egypt and Israel, Shukry said that the treaty has been stable for four decades and has mechanisms that enable it to confront deviations from its rules, and that the treaty must be respected and its provisions must be respected and preserved . The Egyptian Foreign Minister stressed in his speech that the \"war\" on the Gaza Strip caused catastrophic repercussions on the Palestinian people, and that the rules of international law must be complied with, the decisions of the International Court of Justice must be respected, and the system of multilateral international action must be preserved .\n\nThe IDF representatives informed the families of Haim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Koper and Nadav Popelwell, who were brutally abducted to the Gaza Strip, that they are no longer alive and their bodies are being held by the terrorist organization Hamas. The decision to determine their death was based on intelligence information and was approved by an expert committee of the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Religion and the Chief Rabbi of Israel. The circumstances of their deaths in Hamas captivity are still under investigation by all the professionals. The IDF operates in a wide variety of methods in order to gather information about the abductions and the abductees remaining in the Gaza Strip. The IDF and other security agencies will continue to accompany the families of the abductees as long as necessary until they return home.\n\nThe body of the late Dolev Yehud was located in Kibbutz Nir Oz, this after a strenuous investigation by the ITAN unit in collaboration with anthropologists and after scientific identification. The late Dolev Yehud, son of Kibbutz Nir Oz, served as a medic in the Rescue Union and MDA. During the terrorist attack he left his home to help and save lives. The late Dolev was murdered by Hamas on October 7, 22 in Tishrei, and his body was found in Kibbutz Nir Oz. After an identification procedure carried out by medical officials at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Tzvi Beshura Institute, IDF representatives sent a message to the family. The IDF shares in the family's grief at this difficult time.\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday), in the morning, a military exercise will take place in the Carmel Beach area. As part of the exercise, echoes of explosions will be heard in this area. There is no fear of a security incident.\n\nAn initiative to end the war presented by US President Joe Biden sparked a major debate between its supporters and those who rejected it. The initiative, which includes a cessation of Israeli aggression and a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, received a positive attitude from the resistance. On the other hand, the occupation government rejected the initiative, stressing that the war would continue until \"the elimination of Hamas,\" as Benjamin Netanyahu says. Activists considered that the initiative was a lifeline for the occupation government after months of failure and impotence in the Gaza Strip.\n\nMany comments from Arab activists about the US President's initiative to end the war in Gaza . Here we have a comment from \"Ahmed\" who wrote: Since the train to liberate Al-Aqsa has set off and has covered most of the distance and is about to reach the station, it was necessary to complete the remaining meters, especially since its fuel is the blood of our brothers and families. Oh God, grant victory to our mujahideen brothers in the land of Palestine and have mercy on our righteous martyrs. \"Yousriya Hamed\" had a comment in it. I say it quite frankly: what was taken by force can only be recovered by force. The Zionists are a people who do not respond except under the logic of force over them.\n\nAs for the \"Dean\" account, he wrote a comment on this topic. The Zionists' truce is always a truce for the sake of treachery, their covenants are contracts for the sake of breaking, their construction is for the sake of demolition, and their faith is for the sake of lying.\n\nIn addition to being one of the founders of the famous Pink Floyd band, Roger Waters is known as a supporter of the Palestinian cause. Waters appeared in a recent video criticizing the occupation's crimes against civilians, especially in the city of Rafah. The British musician addressed the occupation settlers by saying that they should pack their bags and leave the Palestinian territories. Waters added that those who want to stay must live in the new state in Palestine with equal rights with others.\n\nHere were some comments about Roger Waters' position on the crimes of the occupation. \"Jinan\" was written in this context. This famous British singer, Roger Waters, who was fought by the Zionists and accused of being anti-Jewish, and who was in solidarity with the Palestinian cause and hated torture and injustice against the Palestinians for years, does not care about those who marginalize him or boycott him because he is for truth, justice, and humanity. \"Helmy Mashali,\" in turn, commented, addressing Roger Waters. Well said.. This is the comprehensive solution to all problems in the Middle East.\n\nAn account titled \"Abu Al-Shammaq\" wrote a comment on Water's position. One of the most wonderful and honest clips I have ever seen from artist Roger Waters. Imagine a British artist risking everything he owns, which is his source of livelihood, to speak a word of truth in the face of the people of Zion... and our celebrities are unable to pronounce the name of Palestine in a halting voice, a sad tone, and overcome with tears... This is how the Irish politician Thomas Gould spoke about Palestine. Gold was speaking before the Irish Parliament about the scenes of massacres in the city of Rafah and the scale of Israeli atrocities there.\n\nIn his sad tone, Gold said that he hoped that Benjamin Netanyahu and those with him would burn in hell because of their crimes. These positions of Irish politicians are not new, as Ireland has stood strongly with the Palestinian cause for many years. The speech of Irish MP Thomas Gold received widespread interaction among Arab activists.\n\nSatellite images taken on May 29 showed the incursion and deployment of the Israeli occupation forces into 22% of the area of the Palestinian city of Rafah , with the stationing of 258 military vehicles in various areas and along the Philadelphia axis near the Egyptian border from the west of the Rafah crossing to the Tal al-Sultan area. The Israeli army began a ground attack on the city of Rafah on May 7, when tanks and military vehicles invaded the Rafah land crossing and closed it. Military operations continued until the 29 of the same month when Israel announced its control of the Philadelphia axis, the strategic border strip between the Gaza Strip and Egypt.\n\nSatellite images showed the distribution of Israeli military vehicles inside the city of Rafah, where about 15 military vehicles were stationed in the vicinity of the Kerem Shalom crossing, and about 15 other vehicles were stationed inside the Rafah crossing from the Palestinian side. Another 29 military vehicles were also distributed in the northern neighborhoods of Rafah, including Shokat Al-Safi, Al-Salam neighborhood, and Al-Geneina neighborhood. And 199 military vehicles were deployed along the Philadelphia axis near the Egyptian border, from the west of the Rafah crossing to Tal al-Sultan.\n\nThe images also showed high rates of destruction in the city's neighborhoods, such as the Tabba Zare neighborhood, the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, and the Shoka al-Safi neighborhood. A comparison between photos of neighborhoods on May 15 and 29 reveals the extent of the massive destruction carried out by the occupation army in these areas. Destruction rates in agricultural areas and residential buildings on the outskirts of these neighborhoods increased significantly.\n\nThe forces of Division 162 continue fighting in the Rafah area. In the last day, the fighters located many terrorist infrastructures and weapons in the area during scans. Troops from the Magellan unit located RPG missiles during a raid on a military structure. The forces of the 99th Division continue fighting in the center of the Strip. In the last day the combat team forces of the 679th brigade identified a number of terrorists in a sniping position, an aircraft attacked and eliminated the terrorists. In addition, the forces of the division, in cooperation with the Air Force, eliminated a Hamas TMS operative who was identified in the area. During the last day, fighter jets of the Air Force attacked more than 50 targets, among them terrorist infrastructures, IML warehouses, military buildings and more.\n\nThe Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), said that it detonated a minefield in a Zionist force stationed inside the site of the Martyr Muhammad Abu Shamala Brigade, in Rafah , south of the Gaza Strip. She added that the operation left members of the force dead and wounded, and that it took place in the Tal Al-Sultan neighborhood, west of the city of Rafah. The Al-Qassam Brigades also announced that they bombed with mortar shells a crowd of occupation forces behind the University College in the Al-Sabra neighborhood in Gaza City.\n\nBefore that, Al-Qassam announced that it had bombed the Israeli army headquarters in the Netzarim axis with a 114 mm short-range missile system, confirming that it had targeted an Israeli Merkava tank with an \"Al-Yassin 105\" shell in the vicinity of the university college, south of the Al-Sabra neighborhood, south of Gaza City. It added that its fighters targeted two D-9 military bulldozers with two Tandom shells on Salah al-Din Gate Street in the city of Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip, and another military bulldozer with a Yassin 105 shell near the Al-Amal Association in the Yabna camp in the city of Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn turn, the Al-Quds Brigades , the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement , said that its fighters were engaged in fierce clashes with occupation soldiers and vehicles in the advance areas in the city of Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip, while Haaretz, citing the Israeli army, reported that 46 soldiers had been wounded in the Gaza Strip battles since Thursday, noting that 4 Some of them are in serious condition. The Al-Quds Brigades added - earlier - that they bombed with mortar shells a position of occupation soldiers in the vicinity of the Al-Abd Jabr area in the Yabna camp, south of the city of Rafah. They also targeted an Israeli Merkava tank with two RPG shells south of Khawla School in Rafah, confirming that the tank caught fire.\n\nIt also announced that it bombed with mortar shells the occupation soldiers and vehicles penetrating the Brahma area, west of the Yabna camp in the city of Rafah, amid continuing clashes in the area. On the other hand, the Israeli army announced that 46 soldiers were injured in battles in the Gaza Strip since last Thursday, 4 of them in serious condition. He added that his operations are continuing in the central Gaza Strip and in Rafah, south of the Strip, and that his forces found large quantities of weapons, eliminated what they described as fighters in the region, and dismantled a launcher used to launch rockets.\n\nAs part of its ongoing qualitative operations, the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas) , as announced, detonated a minefield in an Israeli force stationed inside the site of the Martyr Muhammad Abu Shamala Brigade, in Rafah , south of the Gaza Strip . Al-Qassam said that the operation left members of the force dead or wounded, and that it took place in the Tal Al-Sultan neighborhood, west of the city of Rafah.\n\nAccording to the military and strategic expert, Colonel Hatem Karim Al-Falahi, the method of detonating mines by the resistance has proven its effectiveness in multiple battles inside the Gaza Strip, noting that many fields were blown up by the Israeli forces, which attempted to penetrate either into Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, or into Jabalia area , north of the Gaza Strip, during previous battles. He said, in an analysis of the military scene in Gaza, that planting mines on the axes of advance confirms that the resistance factions are responding to the possible hypotheses they have put forward to confront the Israeli army's advance on those axes.\n\nRegarding the battles in the city of Rafah, Colonel Al-Falahi recalled the statements of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , in which he said that the entry of his forces into the city would lead to achieving \"absolute victory\" by destroying the infrastructure and releasing prisoners through military pressure. However, after entering the city of Rafah, Colonel Al-Falahi continues, the Israeli army did not reach the prisoners or the leaders of the Palestinian resistance, in addition to the fact that the confrontation is raging between it and the resistance fighters on 4 main axes inside the city.\n\nDespite its failure to achieve its promised military goals, the resistance factions believe that the occupation wants to prolong the confrontation and war in Rafah, and therefore its fighters used less than 25% of their capabilities, and left the rest for other battles that could take place during the coming period in Rafah, as he explains. Military and strategic expert. It is noteworthy that the Israeli army announced on May 7 that it had completely taken control of the Rafah crossing, and this was followed by committing massacres against civilians in their tents, leaving many martyrs and wounded.\n\nIsraeli occupation forces stormed several cities and towns in the occupied West Bank and clashed with Palestinian resistance fighters. In the town of Idna, west of Hebron, the occupation forces fired live bullets, stun grenades, and toxic tear gas. They also deployed snipers on the roofs of buildings, conducted patrols in the center of the town, and stationed themselves in several areas before withdrawing from the northern entrance to the town. The Israeli occupation forces entered the city of Dura, south of Hebron, and raided some homes and arrested 4 Palestinians. Confrontations broke out between Palestinian youths and the occupation forces, who used live bullets and stun grenades during their withdrawal from the eastern entrance to the city.\n\nThe forces also stormed the city of Tubas, northeast of the West Bank, and Al Jazeera's correspondent reported that additional reinforcements with a military bulldozer arrived in the city amid armed clashes with Palestinian resistance fighters who came out to confront the occupation forces. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the city of Tubas, the Al-Faraa camp, and the Tubas Brigade affiliated with the Al-Quds Brigades claimed responsibility for the armed clash with the occupation forces in the city.\n\nConfrontations broke out east of the city of Nablus, in the northern West Bank, between Palestinians and an Israeli army force, while securing settlers' storming of the \"Joseph's Tomb\" shrine. The occupation army fired live bullets and gas bombs, raided a number of eastern Nablus neighborhoods and searched homes before withdrawing. Eyewitnesses indicated sounds of gunfire and explosions from time to time. Palestinians shared video clips of the Israeli army storming the eastern area of Nablus, accompanied by buses carrying settlers.\n\nThe Palestinians also shared clips showing groups of settlers storming the city from the direction of Mount Gerizim, on foot, from among Palestinian homes. There is \"Joseph's Tomb\" on the eastern side of Nablus, which is under Palestinian control, and Jews consider it a holy shrine since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967. Al Jazeera's correspondent reported that the occupation army withdrew from the vicinity of Joseph's Tomb in Nablus after securing the withdrawal of settlers towards the Beit Furik checkpoint, while some military vehicles remained in the vicinity of the eastern region in preparation for a complete withdrawal.\n\nDuring the night hours, the occupation forces pushed more than 50 military vehicles towards the eastern region to secure the entry of groups of settlers to perform Talmudic prayers after calls from settlement associations to storm the grave. Since the start of the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip , on the seventh of last October , the Israeli occupation army has escalated its operations in the occupied West Bank, leaving hundreds of martyrs and thousands wounded and detained.\n\nAbout 30 launches were detected that crossed from Lebanese territory towards the north of the Golan Heights and fell in an open area. Following the warning about the infiltration of a hostile aircraft in the north of the country earlier today, the air defense fighters intercepted an explosive UAV that crossed from Lebanese territory near the Keren Naftali area. Also, another explosive UAV was detected that crossed from Lebanon and fell in the area. At the same time, an explosive drone that crossed the territory of Lebanon fell in the area of Metula. A short time later, another warning was activated in the north of the country, during which a launcher intercepted a suspicious aerial target that had crossed into the country from Lebanon, the incident ended. There were Israeli casualties in all of the incidents.\n\nDuring the last few hours, an Air Force aircraft attacked a Hizbullah terrorist identified in the A-Nakura area. Earlier today, Air Force fighter jets attacked a military structure of the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the Hanin area. During the night, warplanes attacked a Hezbollah launcher and military buildings in the areas of al-Naqura, Marun al-Ras and al-Hiyam in southern Lebanon.\n\nThis morning an Air Force aircraft attacked the area of Tzur in Lebanon and killed the terrorist Ali Hossein Sabara, a military operative in the formation of the strengthening of the terrorist organization Hezbollah. As part of his position, Hossein Sabara was involved in improving and equipping the Hezbollah air defense system. In addition, the IDF attacked Hezbollah's military infrastructure, which includes several military buildings in the village of al-Katrini in southern Lebanon. These buildings were used by Hezbollah's air defense system.\n\nThe commander of the Northern Command, Major General Uri Gordin, met yesterday (Sunday) with the heads of the authorities in the north. As part of the meeting, a dialogue was held with the heads of the authorities, in which the AGM officer and the intelligence officer of the Northern Command reviewed, presented the main points of the assessment of the situation so far and the processes of accelerating the readiness for the continuation of fighting in the sector.\n\nThe general expressed appreciation for the heads of the authorities and councils, who demonstrate true leadership and dedication, work in close cooperation with the IDF and are an integral part of maintaining security in the sector. From the words of the commander of the Northern Command, Major General Uri Gordin: \"We are in a very broad operational effort to locate Hezbollah's infrastructures and destroy them. I am determined to do this task together with you. It is a significant part of the sense of security, we will manage it together. I am determined to continue working together with you and together with the residents to get through this very complex period - and I have no doubt that security will return.\"\n\nIsraeli Channel 13 reported on Monday that the defenses succeeded in confronting a missile launched from the Red Sea region towards the city of Eilat and the Ilot settlement, and it was destroyed in the air, while the Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that it struck a vital target in Haifa. Social media sites reported pictures showing the defenses intercepting a missile launched towards the city of Eilat.\n\nThe Israeli army explained in a statement that it intercepted a surface-to-surface missile through the \"Arrow\" system after activating sirens in the southern Eilat region. It also indicated that the incident did not cause any casualties. The statement did not mention the party responsible for launching the missile, and no party immediately claimed responsibility for the incident.\n\nFor its part, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced at dawn on Monday that it had launched a drone strike against a vital target in the occupied city of Haifa in response to the massacres committed by the Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip, stressing its continued targeting of \"enemy strongholds.\" Yesterday, Sunday, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq broadcast scenes of the launch of a bomb-laden drone towards the occupied city of Eilat as part of its support for the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip .\n\nIn the video clip, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq sent a message to the people of the Gaza Strip, saying: \"The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, from the land of burning tents to the land of burning tents, the target: Israel/Eilat/a vital target, Saturday 6/1/2024.\"\n\nAir defense fighters successfully intercepted a surface-to-surface missile using the \"Hats\" system that made its way towards Israel from the Red Sea. A warning of rocket and missile fire was activated in the Eilat area, there were no casualties.\n\nThe Yemeni Armed Forces announced on Monday evening that they had targeted the Umm al-Rashrash area in the occupied territories with a \"Palestine\" ballistic missile, which the Armed Forces revealed for the first time. Armed Forces spokesman, Brigadier General Yahya Saree, said in a video statement: \"In victory for the oppression of the Palestinian people and in response to the crimes of the Zionist enemy against the displaced in the Rafah area in the Gaza Strip, the missile force in the Yemeni armed forces targeted a military target of the Israeli enemy in the Umm al-Rashrash area in southern occupied Palestine.\"\n\nSaree stated that the targeting operation was carried out with the \"Palestine\" ballistic missile, which the armed forces revealed for the first time. The spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces confirmed that the operation successfully achieved its goal. The spokesman stressed that the Yemeni armed forces are continuing to carry out their military operations in support of and victory for the Palestinian people.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ( UNRWA ) said on Monday that forced displacement forced more than a million people to flee the city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip. Relief organizations reported that about a million Palestinians were living in the small city located on the southern tip of Gaza after fleeing Israeli attacks in other areas of the Strip.\n\nLeader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei hailed the Al-Aqsa Storm Operation as a decisive blow that the Palestinian resistance forces dealt to the Israeli regime, saying the Zionists won't survive the consequences of such impact. On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of Imam Khomeini's demise, Ayatollah Khamenei delivered a live televised speech at the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini in southern Tehran on Monday.\n\n\"From the very first day of the Islamic Movement, Imam (Khomeini) highlighted the Palestinian issue and, with foresight and scrutiny, he predicted the path ahead for the Palestinian nation. This very important insight of the Imam is gradually being realized,\" the Leader said in the event. Ayatollah Khamenei described the purpose of the annual gathering as a means to honor Imam Khomeini's memory and to apply his teachings towards the administration and progress of the country, as well as the realization of the Revolution's objectives.\n\nIn the first part of his speech, Ayatollah Khamenei explained the importance of the Palestinian issue in the thoughts and opinions of the late Imam Khomeini, emphasizing the rejection of reliance on so-called peace negotiations, the active participation of the Palestinian people in taking back their rights, as well as all nations' help, especially that of the Muslim nations for the Palestinian people. These principles, according to the Leader, embody Imam Khomeini's vision for the ultimate victory of the Palestinians. He further highlighted that these significant developments are currently unfolding.\n\nThe Leader pointed out that the Zionist regime has become trapped in a corner due to the Al-Aqsa Storm operation, adding that, \"Even though the US and many Western governments continue to support this regime, they too are aware that there is no escape for the occupying regime.\"\n\nThe Leader expounded on two important features of Operation Al-Aqsa Strom, which include fulfilling the significant needs of the region and dealing a decisive blow to the criminal regime. \"A comprehensive, broad plan for the region had been devised by the US, Zionist elements, their followers, and certain governments in the region. This comprehensive plan aimed to reshape regional relations and dynamics, (their goal was to) establish relations between the Zionist regime and regional governments based on the wishes of that regime. This in turn meant that the Zionist regime would not only attain domination over the politics and economy of the entire region of West Asia, but also over the entire Islamic world,\" the Leader stated.\n\nAyatollah Khamenei noted that, \"This sinister plan was on the verge of execution when the miraculous Al-Aqsa Flood began and disrupted the Zionist regime's comprehensive plan to dominate the politics and economy of the entire region of West Asia, in such a way that considering the events of the past eight months, there is no hope that they will be able to revive this plan.\" The Leader attributed the unprecedented crimes and boundless brutality of the insane Israeli regime, as well as the US government's support for these atrocities, to agitated reactions towards the disruption of the grand international conspiracy that planned to allow the Zionist regime dominate the region.\n\nTo illustrate the gravity of the surge in reverse migration in the occupied territories, Ayatollah Khamenei referenced the words of a Zionist security analyst. \"This Zionist analyst says, If the content of the discussions and conflicts going on between Israeli officials are published by the media, four million people will leave Israel.'\"\n\nAyatollah Khamenei highlighted the significant transformation of the Palestinian issue into a global priority. He noted the widespread anti-Zionist demonstrations in London, Paris, and US universities, emphasizing the increasing awareness and attention to the plight of the Palestinian people. \"For many years, American-Zionist propaganda and media centers have made an effort to make people forget the Palestinian issue. But in the light of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation and the resilience of the people of Gaza, Palestine is now at the forefront of global issues,\" he noted.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said that the \" Al-Aqsa Flood \" operation was necessary for the region and came at a sensitive time, stressing that it thwarted an American-Western project to change equations in the region. Khamenei pointed out that the Palestinians, through Operation \"Al-Aqsa Flood,\" succeeded in besieging the Israeli occupation government, stressing that \"the Zionist entity no longer has any way to escape.\"\n\nHe also added that the Palestine issue has become the number one topic in the world, noting that the \"Al-Aqsa Flood\" operation was necessary for the region, as it \"failed attempts at normalization with the Zionist entity and its control over the region.\" Khamenei considered the \"Zionist regime's brutal attack\" on Gaza to be a nervous reaction to the failure of its plans for the region, stressing that the \"Al-Aqsa Flood\" was a miracle that put Israel on a path that would end with its demise.\n\nIn his statements, he hinted that one of the aims of the October 7 attack was to sabotage the progress toward normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia: \"There is no need to trust in talks and negotiations whose aim is to achieve normalization. With normalization - the Palestinians will not achieve their rights.\"\n\nKhamenei also said that \"the Palestinian people must struggle against the Zionist entity and force it to retreat by weakening it and continuing attacks against it. Nations need to enter the battlefield to protect the Palestinians -- and then the Zionist entity will cease to exist, which is essentially what is happening today,\" he said. He added that the October 7 massacre, which he referred to as the \"Flood of Al-Aqsa\" operation was an urgent need for the people of the region.\n\n\"This action was a hard blow to the Zionist entity, which has not recovered from it. The 'Flood of Al-Aqsa' thwarted all of the enemy's plans, and the situation in recent months has dispelled all hopes of reviving this plan [of normalization]. The attack came at the right time. I cannot say whether the planner of operation knew what the ramifications would be. The action thwarted the grand plan for the Middle East region.\"\n\nThe Palestinian presidency on Monday criticized the statements of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , in which he said that the \" Al-Aqsa Flood \" operation was necessary for the region. It said in a statement that the Palestinian people \"do not need wars that do not serve their aspirations for freedom and independence,\" noting that they are the ones paying the price for the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Presidency added that Khamenei's statements clearly declare that \"their goal is to sacrifice Palestinian blood and thousands of children, women and the elderly, and to destroy the Palestinian land,\" according to its description.\n\nIt said that these statements will not lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and stressed that she does not want policies that she described as not serving the Palestinian national goals of liberating Jerusalem and its sanctities, and that \"destroy the Palestinian people and displace them from the land whose identity they struggled to preserve,\" according to Her expression.\n\nThe enemies have come to the conclusion that military action against Iran is a non-viable option, the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said, adding that hostile plots to isolate Iran have backfired as the US and Israel are on the decline. \"Today the hypothesis about the probability of war against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the (military) options on the table have been disproved,\" Major General Hossein Salami said in a speech at a meeting of Basij representatives in the Iranian universities on Sunday.\n\nHe said proof of the impossibility of war against Iran is that enthusiasm for investment in Iran has grown as the country continues to make economic progress regardless of the political developments. The direct influence that Iran has on the international political equations at present and the fact that regional security could not be ensured without Iran indicate that the hostile plots to isolate the Islamic Republic have ended in failure, he added. \"Today our enemies, namely the Americans, the Zionists and parts of Europe are in isolation. They have been morally and politically degraded and their deeds go counter to their words,\" the commander stated.\n\nIsraeli media said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu summoned Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir to his office to inform him of the details of the proposed deal to return the \"kidnapped\" in reference to Israeli prisoners held by the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip. Israeli Channel 7 quoted Ben Gvir as threatening again that if Netanyahu continued on the path of concluding this deal, he would dissolve the government. Ben Gvir added that the deal - the details of which were published - means abandoning the destruction of Hamas and abandoning the continuation of the war, describing it as an irresponsible deal.\n\nIsraeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir said that US President Joe Biden's plan means ending the war on Gaza without eliminating the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ), and without achieving the goals of the war. Ben Gvir added - in a press conference - that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed him a day ago that he could see the draft of the deal, but he did not present it to him yet. Rather, Netanyahu's aides told him that there was no draft, according to him.\n\nBen Gvir threatened to dismantle the government if Netanyahu agreed to the deal without eliminating Hamas. He added that the delay in showing him the draft meant that there was a bad agreement that would lead to ending the war without \"annihilating Hamas,\" and he demanded that it be presented immediately, stressing that he would not make a decision before that. The statements of Ben Gvir, one of the extremists in Netanyahu's far-right government, come after Israeli media quoted Netanyahu as saying that what President Biden presented regarding the deal proposal was not accurate, refusing to agree to stop the war on the Gaza Strip before achieving its goals. Netanyahu said - according to what was reported by the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation - that he \"will not review the details of the deal, but what Biden presented is not accurate and there are details that have not been revealed.\" He added, \"We can stop the fighting for 42 days to return the hostages, but we will not give up absolute victory.\"\n\nLikewise, he was quoted by the Israel Today newspaper, where he said, \"Israel can stop the fighting to return the kidnapped people, but it cannot stop the war.\" Channel 12 also quoted him as saying, \"Biden presented only part of the broad outlines of the deal, and we will not stop the war without achieving its goals,\" adding that the number of abductees who will be released in the first phase of the deal has not yet been determined.\n\nN12 TV reported senior officials in the War Cabinet and officials in the negotiation teams intend to demand that Israel not wait for Hamas's answer - but take pro-active steps to ensure that the ability to reach a deal is maximized, among other things through close talks or humanitarian measures. The fear of those parties is that while waiting for Hamas' answer, the deal could be torpedoed, even in Israel - even though it is an Israeli proposal. Senior political officials confirm that this is indeed the Israeli proposal, as stated in the White House. It should be emphasized that the security establishment is also interested in taking advantage of this deal. There are even voices in the security establishment who believe that the war should be stopped and a deal made - even at the cost of Sinwar staying in power at this point.\n\nIn turn, Channel 7 said that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich met with the rabbis of the Religious Zionism Party that he leads, and that the meeting discussed the party's continued membership in the emergency government if an exchange deal was reached according to the current formula. The channel reported that Smotrich made clear - during the meeting - that he does not intend to allow the conclusion of a \"dangerous\" deal and that he continues to conduct consultations regarding possible scenarios.\n\nMeanwhile, the War Council held a meeting to discuss the exchange deal, amid conflicting news about the Israeli position regarding the proposal on the table to conclude the exchange deal after US President Joe Biden announced its details. While the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation said that the negotiating team withheld the details of the proposal from the Ministerial Council for fear of its contents being leaked, the American CBS network quoted an Israeli official as saying that Netanyahu and the War Council agreed to the proposal but were waiting for Hamas' response .\n\nIn turn, Minister of the War Council, Benny Gantz, said that he spoke with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken about the efforts made to reach a deal to release the prisoners. Gantz added that he informed Blinken that returning the prisoners is a top priority, and that he will do his best to exhaust every opportunity to do so. He indicated that he informed Blinken of the importance of American pressure on the mediators in order to implement the broad guidelines set by Israel.\n\nRegarding the so-called day after the war, Defense Minister Yoav Galant said that Israel will not accept the idea of Hamas remaining as an authority at any stage, and that work is underway to find alternative parties to govern the Gaza Strip. Gallant added that combining the military operation with preparations for the formation of an alternative government in Gaza will achieve two goals of the war, which are the overthrow of Hamas' rule, the destruction of its military power, and the return of Israeli prisoners detained in Gaza. The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation said that Gallant informed the US Secretary of State that any deal in Gaza must include the dismantling of Hamas as a governmental and military authority.\n\nIn parallel, the families of Israeli prisoners detained by the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip organized a protest inside the Knesset building during the meeting of the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee with Netanyahu.\n\nIsraeli analysts who spoke during discussions broadcast on Israeli media channels believed that US President Joe Biden wanted to place Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in front of his responsibilities, especially since the proposal he presented a few days ago is Israeli. According to Yarosin Abraham, political affairs correspondent for Channel 12, the White House kept Biden's speech secret until the last hours, and that it informed the Israeli ambassador to Washington, Mike Herzog, and the Prime Minister's Office about 3 hours before the speech.\n\nHe stated that the offices of the Minister in the Mini-War Council, Benny Gantz , and the Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, were informed in advance about the speech, without providing details, but rather general directions in this regard. Last Friday, the American President spoke about a new Israeli proposal to reach a truce and prisoner exchange deal with the Palestinian resistance, and called on Israel to move forward in this direction.\n\nGil Tamari - a political affairs analyst on Channel 13 - said that Biden knows that Netanyahu is not abiding by his pledges, so he exposed him, and he - that is, Biden - is practically mocking the term that Netanyahu coined, which is \"absolute victory,\" and for him there is no such victory. As the analyst said. On the other hand, the leader of the opposition in the Knesset , Yair Lapid, told the Israeli media, \"The State of Israel must conclude the deal because the kidnapped people are dying there.\"\n\nFor his part, Ronen Manelis - a former spokesman for the Israeli army - acknowledged that after 8 months of war, Israel is \"far from victory over the Hamas movement from a military standpoint, and far from defeating it from an authoritarian standpoint,\" indicating that the use of military force will not restore Israeli detainees held by the Palestinian resistance in Gaza, which is the most disturbing matter currently.\n\nGabai Sigioni of the Misgav National Security Institute claimed that the Hamas movement has nothing better than the Lebanese model, as Hezbollah is not the ruler, he says.\n\nReadings by Israeli analysts unanimously agreed that US President Joe Biden's plan to stop the war on Gaza and return the detainees caused confusion in the political and partisan scene in Tel Aviv, amid doubts about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intentions regarding the exchange deal and the day after the war. The readings agreed among themselves that Biden's plan indicates that Netanyahu has reached a dead end in everything related to the perception of the course of the war and its objectives, and the future of the Gaza Strip. Some analyzes estimated that Israel, despite the strength of the far-right government coalition headed by Netanyahu, is moving more towards dissolving the Knesset and holding early elections.\n\nAnalysts estimated that Netanyahu would work to reject Biden's plan in order to continue the war on Gaza, as the readings agreed that the plan was directed to all Israeli political parties, and placed them before the question of the next day and the future of Gaza, where analysts' opinions were unanimous that without a clear Israeli answer to that, the launch would not take place.\n\nUnder the title \"All or Nothing... Netanyahu's dilemma is the most difficult in his history,\" political analyst Ben Caspit wrote an article in the newspaper \"Maariv,\" in which he reviewed Biden's messages to the government and political parties in Israel, by revealing the plan to stop the fighting. Ben Caspit believes that the Prime Minister must choose between the major historical geopolitical deal that will enable Israel to be part of a regional alliance to fortify it against any existential threat, or continue to flounder in the fighting between Gaza and Rafah, or continue to bet and follow the agenda of the far-right parties.\n\nThe political analyst estimated that Netanyahu is in a dilemma that is considered the most difficult in his political career, as there is no room for evasion, procrastination, or hesitation in the face of Washington. Netanyahu, who does not want to lose the far-right government, must decide, but he is not accustomed to making fateful decisions, and he will continue to maneuver even if This led to all Israelis losing the state.\n\nBen Caspit explained that Biden's timing to reveal the details of the plan to stop the fighting was not a coincidence, but rather was on the mark, and came before the possibility of the withdrawal of the head of the \"National Camp\", Benny Gantz , and Minister Gadi Eisenkot , from the emergency government, and in light of the escalation of threats from the head of the \"Jewish Greatness\" party. Itamar Ben Gvir and the head of Religious Zionism, Bezalel Smotrich , to withdraw from the government if an exchange deal is concluded.\n\nIsraeli journalist Nechama Doak believes that Biden's plan reflects the dilemma in which Netanyahu is located, who - in her estimation - has entered a dead end in everything related to the strength and stability of his government coalition, and how to deal with the course of the war, the next day, and the future of Gaza. She estimated in her article in the newspaper \"Israel Today\" that there are two possibilities regarding the timing of the US President's speech, which revealed the Israeli proposal to stop the fighting. The first is that the speech and the timing of its publication were coordinated with Netanyahu, as it is possible that he was the one who called for the speech to be delivered, and the second is that the speech and the timing of its publication were coordinated with Netanyahu. It is that Biden did not inform Netanyahu and \"took the plan behind the scenes\" to put internal pressure on him.\n\nBut Doak tends to adopt the first option, which is that everything is coordinated between Biden and Netanyahu, who is longing for someone to manage this crisis for him, and she says that \"despite all the talk of absolute victory, Netanyahu has come to realize that he has reached a dead end, and he needs a lifeline from... the outside\". She suggested that Biden's announced plan would have an impact on the political and partisan scene in Israel, as Gantz is pushing a bill to dissolve the Knesset, saying, \"Even in Likud, the situation is not calm. There are those who suggested to Netanyahu to set a date for the elections, and his answer was that he would think about the matter.\"\n\nIn the context of the echoes and interaction of the Biden plan in Israeli political and partisan circles, former Labor Party leader Shelly Yachimovich says that the Netanyahu plan revealed by Biden will not be achieved as long as the signatory holds the position of prime minister, as he will be keen to destroy it, because it conflicts with his existence and political future.\n\nIt is believed that the first bullet to kill and eliminate the plan was fired by Netanyahu through his coalition partners from the far-right parties who threatened to dismantle the government, while parties and leaders in the opposition camp have reservations about the plan because of Netanyahu and not because of the Biden administration, as they question his intention in everything related to the conduct of the war and the restoration of the plan.\n\nShe suggested in her article in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the ambiguous approach adopted by the Prime Minister has strengthened the convictions of even party leaders from the right-wing camp in the opposition, that Netanyahu wants an endless war, and is holding Israel hostage for his interests, in isolation from the course and developments of the fighting and without caring about the detainees. Accordingly, they support the draft law to dissolve the Knesset and go to early elections.\n\nIn a reading of the Biden administration's messages regarding the announcement of the plan to stop fighting, the former Israeli consul in New York, Alon Pinkas, estimated in his article in the newspaper \"Haaretz\" that Biden acted wisely in announcing the plan, but he proved once again that he \"does not explain Netanyahu correctly.\" The former Israeli consul explained that whether the US President was talking about an actual Israeli proposal or the US administration's interpretation of Israeli ideas, it is likely that the uproar raised by Biden will push Netanyahu to withdraw, disavow the plan, and fight it.\n\nIn light of the state of confusion in the Israeli political scene that followed the unveiling of Biden's plan, Pinkas says, \"If this is an Israeli proposal, it contradicts all of Netanyahu's statements celebrating absolute victory and the slogans of eliminating Hamas and undermining it militarily and politically.\" The former Israeli consul wondered whether Biden's goal was to put pressure on Israel, or whether he wanted - and intentionally - to implicate Netanyahu with the coalition partners, saying, \"Practically here lies the innovation in Biden's speech, as he clearly demands not a ceasefire, but rather an end to the war.\" This is something that Netanyahu will not agree to.\"\n\nNot every number is reported every day, so sudden jumps generally reflect reporting artifacts rather than actual upticks. Many of these numbers fluctate, up and down, with no apparent explanation. This list records the highest number reliably reported for each matter, under the theory that reality with catch up with reports, as is relentlessly the case.\n\nSome reports claimed that the UN cut in half its earlier estimates of women and children killed in Gaza. Initially, they reported 9,500 women and 14,500 children killed, but later revised it to 4,959 women and 7,797 children on 08 May 2024. The UN acknowledged its inability to independently verify casualty figures. The seeming discrepancy is that HAMAS had about 10K KIA bodies on hand for which they do not have positive ID. It is possible to report the gender and approximate age [ie, juvenile] without knowing the name of the deceased.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

by U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nWashington said it would seek a UN Security Council resolution to back the three-phase plan which was welcomed by the Group of Seven developed countries and by leading regional governments.\n\nUnder the proposal which Mr. Biden presented last Friday as Israel's plan, fighting would stop for an initial six weeks and hostages would be swapped for Palestinian prisoners, ahead of the start of the rebuilding of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has, however, stressed since that fighting would only have to cease temporarily to free the captives, and that one of Israel's key war aims remains the destruction of Hamas.\n\nThe White House insisted on Monday that the plan was Israel's own and not drafted by Washington to put pressure on its key ally. \"It is an Israeli proposal,\" said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby. \"It's one that we, and they, worked on through some intense diplomacy.\"\n\nHamas, the Islamist group that has long ruled the Palestinian territory of 2.4 million people, said on Friday it viewed Mr. Biden's outline \"positively\" but has since made no official comment.\n\nThe group has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza in months of intermittent talks involving U.S., Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nFor now, the Gaza war raged on unabated, with the Israeli military reporting more air and artillery strikes and ground combat against Hamas, and Palestinians bemoaning more civilian deaths.\n\n'No alternative'\n\nWashington unveiled a draft UN Security Council resolution on Monday that \"welcomes the new deal... and calls upon Hamas to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition\".\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said \"numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan\".\n\nThe truce plan also drew the full endorsement of the other leaders of the G-7.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The United States on Monday announced a draft Security Council resolution supporting the Israel-Hamas ceasefire plan outlined by Joe Biden last week, urging Hamas to accept it.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan,\" said US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\n\nThe draft text, seen by AFP, \"welcomes the new deal announced on 31 May, and calls upon Hamas to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\"\n\nBiden outlined on Friday what he called an Israeli plan that in three phases would end the bloody conflict, free all hostages and lead to the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory without Hamas in power.\n\nHowever, fissures between the two allies emerged when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stressed that the ongoing war in Gaza would continue until all of Israel's \"goals are achieved,\" including the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities.\n\nIsraeli media have questioned to what extent Biden's ceasefire speech and some crucial details were coordinated with Netanyahu's team, including how long any truce would hold and how many captives would be freed and when.\n\nEarlier Monday, the White House said Biden told the emir of mediator Qatar that he saw Hamas as \"the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\" in Gaza and urged him to press the group to accept it.\n\nHamas last week said it viewed Biden's outline \"positively,\" but has since made no official comment on the stalled negotiations, while mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have not announced any new talks.\n\nBefore Biden had made his Friday announcement, Algeria had last week circulated a draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and a halt of the Israeli offensive on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, citing the recent order to that effect from the International Court of Justice.\n\nWashington at the time had said that the text wouldn't be helpful, saying instead direct, on-the-ground negotiations were necessary for a truce.\n\nNo vote is scheduled for either draft resolution.\n\nThe council has struggled to find a unified voice since the war broke out with the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel, followed by Israel's retaliatory campaign.\n\nAfter passing two resolutions centred on the need for humanitarian aid to people in Gaza, in March the council passed a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire - an appeal that had been blocked several times before by the United States.\n\nWashington, increasingly frustrated with the mounting civilian death toll, finally allowed that resolution to pass by abstaining from voting.", "source": {"uri": "ewn.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "EWN Traffic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@ewn.co.za", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Thomas-Greenfield", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Thomas-Greenfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media-cache.primedia-service.com/media/ir5jqin0/afp__20240531__34uh6q2__v4__highres__israelpalestiniansconflictuspoliticsbiden.jpg?width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 391, "textEnd": 397}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2202, "textEnd": 2211}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Despite pushing for a ceasefire, Biden noted it's uncertain if Israeli forces committed war crimes. The conflict has deepened Israel's political rifts.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu may be stalling on ending the war in Gaza for political reasons, according to an interview with Time magazine released on Tuesday. The comments in the May 28 interview were made a few days before Biden detailed a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, and as the Israeli prime minister struggles with deep political divisions at home.\n\nAsked whether he thought Netanyahu was prolonging the war for his own political reasons, Biden said: \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\" Biden, who has been pushing for an end to the nearly eight-month war, also said it was \"uncertain\" whether Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza.\n\nLast month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor in The Hague requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense chief, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged war crimes. Israel launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October vowing to destroy the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas after it attacked inside Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Around 120 hostages remain in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli assault has killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble. Opinion polls show most Israelis support the war but blame Netanyahu for the security failures when Hamas gunmen rampaged through Israeli communities near Gaza on Oct. 7, and would vote him out if there were an election.\n\nMass street protests have become weekly events, drawing tens of thousands demanding the government do more to bring home hostages seized by Hamas in Oct. 7 and calling for Netanyahu to go.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_05_2024_09_52_50_9661367.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 539, "textEnd": 545}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1848, "textEnd": 1854, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The scenes of destruction & suffering of people are heart-wrenching.\"\n\n\"There is a serious proposal on the table outlined by President Joe Biden, and I urge all parties to reach an agreement immediately to achieve a ceasefire and return the hostages. There is no alternative and any delay, every day simply costs more lives,\" he posted on X.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer earlier quoted Netanyahu as saying that the outline Biden presented was only \"partial,\" and that under the plan fighting would only stop temporarily \"for the purpose of returning the hostages.\"\n\nThe fighting showed no sign of easing, with the war that has devastated the coastal territory of 2.4 million people soon to enter its ninth month.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military said its forces had struck \"over 50 targets\" over the past day, and Gaza hospitals reported at least 19 fatalities in overnight strikes.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,470 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of all structures in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\nHeavy fighting has raged especially in Gaza's far-southern Rafah area near the Egyptian border, where UN agencies say most civilians have now been displaced once more.\n\nUN and other aid agencies have warned for months of the looming risk of famine in the besieged territory amid a spiralling humanitarian crisis.\n\nAmong bombed out buildings in the southern city of Khan Yunis, displaced Gazans were trying to remove sewage from their tents on Monday after a pipeline burst, flooding them in dirty water.\n\n\"This is no life,\" said Abdullah Barbakh.\n\n\"The sewage has flooded over us. We can't eat or drink, and we're unable to sleep. We are sleeping in the streets,\" said resident Abdul Samad Barbakh.\n\nIn northern Israel, firefighters were battling intense forest fires that broke out shortly after rocket and drone strikes from

The president spoke to Time on May 28.\n\nLast October, Hamas militants launched an unexpected attack on Israel, storming into the south of the country and killing 1,200 people and abducting about 250 others. Israel then began airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, and the conflict has escalated over the past eight months, with more than 36,000 Palestinians killed, according to Associated Press reports citing the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nBiden's latest remarks about Netanyahu come in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has said. Trump, who is set to take on Biden in a presidential rematch in November, has said that the prime minister \"rightfully has been criticized for what took place on October 7.\"\n\nIn an April interview with Time, Trump said that the October 7 attack \"should have never happened,\" but it did \"on [Netanyahu's] watch.\" The presumptive Republican nominee also blamed the prime minister for not seeing it coming.\n\n\"They have the most sophisticated equipment,\" Trump said. \"They had -- everything was there to stop that. And a lot of people knew about it, you know, thousands and thousands of people knew about it, but Israel didn't know about it, and I think he's being blamed for that very strongly, being blamed.\"\n\nBiden told Time that while he does not fault Netanyahu for the attack, he disagrees with the Israeli leader over \"what happens after Gaza's over.\"\n\n\"What does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" the president asked. \"I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work.\n\n\"There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu,\" Biden said.\n\nThis past Friday, Biden made a surprise announcement outlining a peace proposal he said that Israel had put forward. The three-part plan would ultimately lead to a permanent cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and include the release of all hostages still being held by Hamas.\n\nBut doubts about the plan grew over the weekend after Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said Israel will not end the war until Hamas is destroyed, said Saturday that his conditions \"have not changed\" and that a permanent cease-fire was a \"nonstarter.\"\n\n\"Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent cease-fire is put in place,\" a statement from Netanyahu's office said. \"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a nonstarter.\"\n\nHowever, Netanyahu's chief foreign policy adviser, Ophir Falk, emphasized to Britain's Sunday Times that Israel was not rejecting the proposal, saying that it was \"a deal we agreed to -- it's not a good deal, but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them.\"\n\nOn Monday, Biden spoke by phone with a critical mediator in the negotiations to confirm \"Israel's readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas,\" the White House said. A readout of that call affirmed that \"Hamas is now the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire and relief for the people of Gaza.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine Fung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2403530/biden-netanyahu-gaza-war.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=36adc42aae749a3ebd3ce41d8d66409a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 262, "textEnd": 271, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 517, "textEnd": 523}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The prime minister's office reiterated that point in a statement, saying, \"The claims that we have agreed to a cease-fire without our conditions being met are incorrect.\"\n\nNetanyahu's comments underscored how he has struggled to navigate competing pressures from Israel's allies and the international community, which are demanding a stop to the fighting, and his right-wing coalition partners who want Israel to forge ahead in Gaza until Hamas is eliminated.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bezalel Smotrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/06/04/2024-06-03T221707Z959599549RC2UK7ARHYVZRTRMADP3ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-NETANYAHU-CONGRESS.JPG?VersionId=STDez6M6LuqN1aTln19Rp331NXNrS_07", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 106, "freq": 5}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 1336, "textEnd": 1342}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1507, "textEnd": 1512}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

In essence, it is being viewed as a U.S. attempt to save the Israeli occupation regime before its \"absolute defeat\" in the totally blockaded enclave and isolation on the world stage.\n\nThe White House is also believed to have offered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a path out of the fierce opposition in his cabinet to ending the war.\n\nThe Israeli premier faces threats from his cabinet ministers to bring down the government as well as a plummeting approval rating among Israelis.\n\nFollowing Biden's ceasefire proposal speech, 120,000 Israelis flooded the streets of Tel Aviv alone, the largest anti-government demonstrations since October 7, demanding a captive exchange swap with Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe text of Biden's ceasefire proposal is based on a previous offer in which Hamas and the Israelis outlined their terms but only Hamas ended up accepting.\n\nHowever, there are some differences on what Biden said on TV during his speech at the White House and what is written in the actual text of the ceasefire proposal delivered to Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nThis comes as the Guardian newspaper cited experts on Monday as saying there may be more Hamas fighters in the north of Gaza, supposedly cleared by Israeli forces months ago, than in Rafah, the southern city in the territory described by Israeli officials as the organization's \"last stronghold\".\n\nThe battles in Jabaliya (northern Gaza) between lightly armed Hamas fighters and the powerful Israeli military force underlined the ability of Hamas to return to parts of Gaza ... threatening a \"forever war\" for months or even years to come, as the Israeli military tries to stamp out a tenacious insurgency, the Guardian cited experts as saying.\n\nHowever other experts argue that Hamas and other Palestinian resistance factions have enough arms in stock to fight the Israeli occupation forces for several years and that Hamas did not return to Jabalia but never left the northern Gazan city in the first place.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Quartet included the US, the EU, the Russian Federation, and the UN.\n\nIsrael was led by its then prime minister Ariel Sharon, who accepted the road map after strong US pressure but only on the condition of rejecting the Arab Peace Plan that had been adopted one year earlier by an Arab Summit meeting in Beirut.\n\nNothing came of that ambitious and detailed Plan.\n\nMore than three decades later, US President Joe Biden released a second road map to peace on 31 May.\n\nThis time it is a joint US-Israeli initiative that aims at ending the \"crisis\" in Gaza. This is the term that is being used to describe the savage war that Israel has unleashed on the Gaza Strip and has been pursuing for the last 241 days. During that period, it has almost obliterated three-quarters of Gaza and taken the lives of more than 36,000 Palestinian civilians with more than 80,000 injured.\n\nAcccording to Palestinian statistics, there are 10,000 children in Gaza who have lost limbs in the war, to the extent that one Western observer commenting on the devastating consequences of the war on the Palestinians in Gaza said that once the war is over Gaza \"will be a nation of amputees\".\n\nThe Biden road map is divided into three phases, and it is not as detailed or ambitious as the one put forward in 2003. One difference between the two is the fact that it is solely a US-Israeli endeavour.\n\nIn outlining the main points of his road map, Biden said that the ultimate aim is the ending of the war in Gaza in stages. The first stage would last six weeks and aim at a complete ceasefire coupled with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas in Gaza. In the meantime, a certain number of Israeli hostages would be freed in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\n\nDuring this six weeks, 600 trucks carrying humanitarian assistance would be allowed to enter Gaza. Israel and Hamas would also start negotiating a ceasefire.\n\nThe second phase would see the release of all the hostages and an agreement on a permanent ceasefire. In the third stage. Hamas would hand over the remains of any hostages who had died in custody. The reconstruction of Gaza would begin.\n\nBiden did not provide details on the sources of financing the Herculean task of reconstruction, nor on the countries and international and regional economic and financial institutions that would agree to share in the burden of reconstructing Gaza.\n\nHe merely talked about the role of the US as well as \"partners\" in the region. It goes without saying that a permanent ceasefire is a pre-condition for the Gaza reconstruction to begin.\n\nBiden stressed the US commitment to the security of Israel in his remarks. He also believes that there is a strong chance of the normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, in addition to integrating Israel more into the Middle East.\n\nHowever, it is doubtful under the present circumstances that we can expect the Israelis to accept a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The reactions from the Israeli government's extreme right ministers to Biden's remarks surprised no one.\n\nIsraeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X (Twitter) that accepting the proposals would be a \"victory for terrorism and a security danger to the State of Israel.\" Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich demanded the continuation of the fighting until the destruction of Hamas and the return of all the hostages.\n\nThe two men have threatened to leave the government if it accepts to go along with the Biden road map.\n\nNetanyahu's office issued a statement that reiterated the Israeli government's conditions for agreeing to a permanent ceasefire, namely the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all the hostages, and steps taken to ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\n\nOn 1 June, the US, Egypt, and Qatar issued a statement saying that they believed that the road map would lead to a permanent ceasefire and end the \"crisis,\" meaning the war in Gaza. However, it will not be surprising if this war does not end in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt seems that the fate of the second roadmap of the Middle East will not be different from the first one in 2003.\n\nThe writer is former assistant foreign minister.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629

Associated Press\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday it killed two Palestinians, who it claimed were attempting to launch a shooting attack toward Israeli communities from the occupied West Bank. A surge of violence has gripped the West Bank since the October start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, where Palestinian health officials said Israeli strikes killed at least 11 people overnight into Tuesday.\n\nA cease-fire proposal announced by United States President Joe Biden has placed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a crossroads. The proposal offers the possibility of ending Israel's war against Hamas, returning scores of hostages held by the militant group, quieting the northern border with Lebanon and potentially advancing a historic agreement to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground operations in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel's expanding offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians facing widespread hunger.\n\nIsrael launched the war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel's military confirmed the deaths Monday of four more hostages held by Hamas. Around 80 hostages captured on Oct. 7 are believed to still be alive in Gaza, alongside the remains of 43 others.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The U.S. urges U.N. Security Council to support a cease-fire plan in Gaza announced by President Biden.\n\n-- Proposed Gaza cease-fire puts Netanyahu at a crossroads that could shape his legacy.\n\n-- Iran's acting top diplomat dismisses U.S.-proposed Gaza cease-fire deal in visit to Lebanon.\n\n-- Palestinian officials apply to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide at the top U.N. court.\n\n-- Israeli airstrikes near Syria's Aleppo kill several, including an Iranian adviser, reports say.\n\n-- Israel declares four more hostages are dead in Gaza.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at

There is no alternative -- and any delay, every day simply costs more lives,\" he posted on X.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer earlier quoted Netanyahu as saying that the outline Biden presented was only \"partial\", and that under the plan fighting would only stop temporarily \"for the purpose of returning the hostages\".\n\nThe fighting showed no sign of easing, with the war that has devastated the coastal territory of 2.4 million people soon to enter its ninth month.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military said its forces had struck \"over 50 targets\" over the past day, and Gaza hospitals reported at least 19 fatalities in overnight strikes.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,470 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of all structures in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\n- 'This is no life' -\n\nHeavy fighting has raged especially in Gaza's far-southern Rafah area near the Egyptian border, where UN agencies say most civilians have now been displaced once more.\n\nUN and other aid agencies have warned for months of the looming risk of famine in the besieged territory amid a spiralling humanitarian crisis.\n\nAmong bombed out buildings in the southern city of Khan Yunis, displaced Gazans were trying to remove sewage from their tents on Monday after a pipeline burst, flooding them in dirty water.\n\n\"This is no life,\" said Abdullah Barbakh.\n\n\"The sewage has flooded over us. We can't eat or drink, and we're unable to sleep. We are sleeping in the streets,\" said resident Abdul Samad Barbakh.\n\nIn northern Israel, firefighters were battling intense forest fires that broke out shortly after rocket and drone strikes from neighbouring Lebanon, forcing the partial evacuation of Kiryat Shmona.\n\nAn AFP photographer in the northeastern town saw intense blazes engulfing parts of the area bordering Lebanon, the scene of near-daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli army and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group on the sidelines of the war in Gaza.\n\nburs/mtp/ser", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

The scenes of destruction & suffering of people are heart-wrenching\".\n\n\"There is a serious proposal on the table -- outlined by President Biden -- and I urge all parties to reach an agreement immediately to achieve a ceasefire and return the hostages. There is no alternative -- and any delay, every day simply costs more lives,\" he posted on X.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer earlier quoted Netanyahu as saying that the outline Biden presented was only \"partial\", and that under the plan fighting would only stop temporarily \"for the purpose of returning the hostages\".\n\nThe fighting showed no sign of easing, with the war that has devastated the coastal territory of 2.4 million people soon to enter its ninth month.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military said its forces had struck \"over 50 targets\" over the past day, and Gaza hospitals reported at least 19 fatalities in overnight strikes.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 36,470 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSome 55 percent of all structures in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed, damaged or \"possibly damaged\" since the war erupted, according to the United Nations satellite analysis agency.\n\n- 'This is no life' -\n\nHeavy fighting has raged especially in Gaza's far-southern Rafah area near the Egyptian border, where UN agencies say most civilians have now been displaced once more.\n\nUN and other aid agencies have warned for months of the looming risk of famine in the besieged territory amid a spiralling humanitarian crisis.\n\nAmong bombed out buildings in the southern city of Khan Yunis, displaced Gazans were trying to remove sewage from their tents on Monday after a pipeline burst, flooding them in dirty water.\n\n\"This is no life,\" said Abdullah Barbakh.\n\n\"The sewage has flooded over us. We can't eat or drink, and we're unable to sleep. We are sleeping in the streets,\" said resident Abdul Samad Barbakh.\n\nIn northern Israel, firefighters were battling intense forest fires that broke out shortly after rocket and drone strikes from neighbouring Lebanon, forcing the partial evacuation of Kiryat Shmona.\n\nAn AFP photographer in the northeastern town saw intense blazes engulfing parts of the area bordering Lebanon, the scene of near-daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli army and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group on the sidelines of the war in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Around 120 hostages remain in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli assault has killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.\n\nOpinion polls show most Israelis support the war but blame Netanyahu for the security failures when Hamas gunmen rampaged through Israeli communities near Gaza on Oct. 7, and would vote him out if there were an election.\n\nMass street protests have become weekly events, drawing tens of thousands demanding the government do more to bring home hostages seized by Hamas in Oct. 7 and calling for Netanyahu to go.\n\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Peter Graff)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008\u20132009)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza War (2008\u20132009)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/d7aaded/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F83%2F377639d98e4052553c58b109a10331%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK530JD%3A12024-06-04T130124Z_1_LYNXMPEK530JD_RTROPTP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-BIDEN.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 239, "textEnd": 245}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1551, "textEnd": 1557, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.607843137254902, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The rapidly growing isolationist America First Committee has surpassed 800,000 members. They claim that nothing can imperil America's national security interests. The Nazi sympathizers of the German-American Bund march down major streets of Manhattan. Students at Columbia, Berkeley and Yale hold massive demonstrations against the war. Father Coughlin's antisemitic radio broadcasts reach tens of millions of listeners. He endlessly asks, \"Must the entire world go to war for 600,000 Jews who are neither American, nor French, nor English citizens, but citizens of Germany?\"\n\nToday, powerful elements within the Democratic Party, convinced they are immune from the jihadist hatred so ardently displayed towards Israel and all non-jihadists, are behaving precisely like that.\n\nThis was reflected in President Joe Biden's June 1 speech.\n\nBiden opened his remarks by claiming that his negotiators are focused \"not just on a ceasefire\" in the Israel-Hamas conflict \"but a durable end to the war.\"\n\nThe devil, as always, is in the details.\n\nThis alone would essentially ensure a victory for Hamas after eight months of fighting. After all, what is to prevent Hamas or a similar group from seizing power after an Israeli withdrawal?\n\nBiden also stated, \"Palestinians -- civilians -- would return to their homes and neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, including in the north.\" But in an asymmetrical war, in which Hamas terrorists do not wear uniforms and do not carry dog tags or army ID cards (in violation of the Geneva Convention), how can one distinguish between a Palestinian civilian and a Hamas terrorist?\n\nThe formula for hostage releases in exchange for terrorist prisoners is also totally asymmetrical. Biden spoke of \"a release of a number of hostages -- including women, the elderly, the wounded -- in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\"\n\nNote the phrase \"a number of hostages,\" rather than \"all remaining hostages.\" What is \"a number\"? One? Two? A hundred? Why not one Palestinian prisoner for one hostage? Haven't we learned our lesson from the 2011 deal that released 1,027 prisoners in exchange for IDF soldier Gilad Shalit, including Hamas mastermind Yahya Sinwar?\n\nBiden continued, \"Humanitarian assistance would surge with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day.\" However, a study by a group of highly esteemed public health officials and academics has found that the amount of calories coming into Gaza from Israel is 40% higher than the humanitarian standard for daily calorie intake. The problem has never been the efforts made by Israel to deliver food. The problem has always been Hamas' plundering and looting of the food, as has been reported by Reuters.\n\nMagnanimous promises are in store for us in phase two, such as \"The cessation of hostilities, permanently.\" How long is \"permanently\"? Until Hamas can regroup and reestablish its control over Gaza? Until the international community runs out of the will to negotiate ad nauseum with Hamas?\n\nAnd if we are dealing with an entity that is expected to live in peace and security just a few meters away from Israel, why is it necessary to state that there will be \"an exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers.\"\n\nTherein lies the rub. The entire civilized world knows exactly what Hamas is. Its terrorists themselves videotaped their sadistic atrocities on Oct. 7. We all witnessed the serial use of sexual violence against women and men; the burning of children in front of their parents; the massive slaughter of parents in front of their children, the holding of sex slaves for eight months. We all heard the blood-curdling phone call of a child triumphantly bragging to his parents, \"Open What'sApp. I killed 10 Jews with my own hands!\" And the mother responds, \"Oh my son. May God bless you!\"\n\nAt first blush, phase three sounds like a wonderful \"kumbaya moment,\" except for the minor fact that Israel would not be allowed to ensure the integrity of its own borders or the security of its own people. Authority over borders would most likely fall into the hands of Egypt, which allowed the construction of hundreds of miles of terror tunnels from beneath Gaza into Egyptian territory. The tunnels were used to smuggle weapons into Gaza. There would also be a major role for Qatar, which magnanimously hosts the strongmen of Hamas in Doha and poisons the minds of the Arabic-speaking world through pro-Hamas Al Jazeera. All this would take place after the United States pours billions of taxpayer dollars into Gaza to rebuild it.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has never been willing to acknowledge that the Oslo Accords were a failed paradigm from the start. There is no reason to think that the Department will not attempt to replace the Hamas leadership with a \"revitalized Palestinian Authority.\" They may well try to pluck the arch-terrorist Marwan Barghouti from an Israeli prison, where he has remained since he was convicted of mass murder. As head of the Tanzim terrorist group, Barghouti took part in a terror campaign that killed over a thousand Israeli civilians -- the second intifada.\n\nMoreover, according to recent polls taken by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, there is minimal support for the P.A. among Palestinians. Worse still, 71% of Palestinians said Hamas's decision to commit the Oct. 7 atrocities was correct.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Biden declared, \"Israel has offered a comprehensive new proposal\" in order to justify his plan.\n\nYet that same day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X, \"Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: The destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\nHe added, \"Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place. The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.\"\n\nBiden assured us nonetheless, \"The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they've devastated Hamas forces over the past eight months. At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7, which was one of the Israelis' main objectives in this war and, quite frankly, a righteous one.\"\n\nHamas is a theocratic, nationalist autocracy. The people of Gaza and much of Judea and Samaria have been indoctrinated from age two to support it. The only way to defeat it is the way the Allies defeated the Nazis: complete and total victory. Without this, we will see countless Oct. 7's.\n\nIn a mad, isolationist world with an impending presidential election in the United States, assurances from the Biden or any other administration regarding Israel's survival must remain meager and paltry.\n\nIsrael, the Jew among the nations, has no one to depend on but itself.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

see a very clear position from the Israeli government towards the principles laid out by Biden,\" foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said, adding there was no \"concrete approval\" from either side.\n\n\"We have read and seen the contradictory statements coming in from Israeli ministers, which doesn't give us much confidence of there being a unified position in Israel over this current proposal on the table,\" Ansari told a regular press conference.\n\nThe Palestinian movement Hamas has also yet to give a firm response, the official added.\n\n\"We haven't seen any statements on both sides that give us a lot of confidence,\" he added, noting, however, that \"the process is progressing and we have been working with both sides on proposals on the table\".\n\nQatar, with the US and Egypt, has been engaged in months of back-and-forth negotiations over details for a ceasefire and exchange of hostages and prisoners by both sides.\n\nBut with the exception of a seven-day break in the fighting beginning in November that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, a series of in-person mediation efforts have not stopped the fighting.\n\nIn an effort to reinvigorate talks, US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Israel was offering a new three-stage roadmap towards a full ceasefire, including the release of hostages held by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAccording to the US president, Israel's three-stage offer would begin with a six-week phase that would see Israeli forces withdraw from all populated areas of Gaza and an initial hostage-prisoner exchange.\n\nThe parties would then negotiate for a lasting ceasefire, with the truce to continue as long as talks are ongoing.\n\nIn its final phase, the plan would lead to the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory without Hamas in power, Biden said.\n\n\"There is momentum internationally, driven by the US... but we need to be very cautious,\" Ansari said.\n\n\"We are using our leverage as a mediator...to make sure that both sides understand the gravity of the situation and the need to reach an agreement.\"\n\nThe US president and Qatar's ruler spoke on Monday, when, according to the White House, Biden told the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, that Hamas was the only obstacle to a Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel, and urged him to press the group to accept it.\n\nNegotiations ground to a halt in early May as Israel began ground operations in Rafah in southern Gaza.\n\nPrevious frameworks presented by mediators have run aground over Hamas's demand that any truce lead to a permanent ceasefire, while Israel has said it must be allowed to pursue its war aim of destroying the Palestinian militant group.", "source": {"uri":

But after US President Joe Biden publicly outlined Israel's latest ceasefire proposal on Friday - one that could lead to a permanent truce and which Hamas may be prepared to accept - Netanyahu is now out of time.\n\n\"I think that Bibi is cornered now,\" said Aviv Bushinsky, a former adviser to Netanyahu, using the prime minister's nickname. Biden is \"forcing Bibi to take off his mask and say: 'OK, now is the money time. Are you in favor of a deal?',\" he said.\n\nAs Israel awaits Hamas' response to the latest proposal, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and other far-right members of Netanyahu's coalition are already threatening to bolt from the government and cause its collapse if the prime minister follows through.\n\nAmid the chorus of threats from his right flank, Netanyahu is trying to reframe the latest ceasefire proposal, insisting to Ben Gvir and others that the terms of the deal are not as Biden defined them. While Biden squarely framed the proposal as a way to end the war, Netanyahu is insisting Israel will not end the war until and unless Hamas is eliminated.\n\nNetanyahu told the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Security Committee on Monday that \"the claim that we agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met is not true.\"\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the permanent ceasefire outlined in the second phase of the proposal, the conditions of which Israel and Hamas would need to negotiate during the first phase - a point Netanyahu has sought to emphasize in recent days.\n\nAccording to Biden, the three-phase proposal would pair a release of hostages with a \"full and complete ceasefire.\"\n\nBut Netanyahu's spokesperson told journalists at a briefing Monday that Biden had presented only a \"partial\" outline of the deal Israel had offered Hamas.\n\n\"The war will be stopped for the purpose of returning hostages and then we will proceed with further discussions. There are other details that the US President did not present to the public,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe spokesperson reiterated Israel's refusal to agree to any ceasefire until all hostages had been released, until Gaza no longer posed \"a threat\" to Israel, and until Hamas's \"governing and military capabilities\" in Gaza had been eradicated.\n\n\"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter. It's not an option,\" said the spokesperson.\n\nNetanyahu's efforts to convince the far-right ministers in order to avoid choosing between a ceasefire deal and the survival of his government have so far fallen flat. Ben Gvir said Monday that Netanyahu's office refused to follow through on a commitment to show him the draft proposal, leaving him convinced the prime minister has something to hide.\n\nIf Ben Gvir or Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich don't back off their threats to leave the government, Netanyahu will be back to the binary choice that is beginning to materialize before his eyes.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to provide a \"safety net\" to keep the government in power in order to achieve a ceasefire deal, but doing so would also be handing Lapid the keys to forcing early elections once the deal is implemented.\n\nJust as it has been over the past eight months, Netanyahu's political survival may be wrapped up in the continuation of the war and his elusive pursuit of total victory over Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu is confronting the choice between his government's survival and a hostage deal at a time when his political fortunes have begun to improve. For the first time this year, Netanyahu edged out his chief political rival Benny Gantz as the preferred choice for prime minister for Israelis, 36 percent to 30 percent, according to a Channel 12 survey last week.\n\nAnd a smattering of recent polls have shown Gantz's National Unity party faltering, while Netanyahu's Likud is making modest gains. National Unity would still win a plurality of seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, but the party's 19-seat advantage over Likud in December has dropped to a four-seat advantage in last week's Channel 12 poll.\n\nThe improvement in Netanyahu's political standing coincided with a surge of international condemnation of Israel's war effort in Gaza and the International Criminal Court's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, all of which have positioned Netanyahu domestically as Israel's defender, a familiar and comfortable role for Israel's longest-serving prime minister. Meanwhile, Gantz's threat to leave the war cabinet over Netanyahu's lack of long-term strategy in Gaza appears to be the cause of his drop in support.\n\nA poll by Israel's Channel 11 on Monday put the Israeli public's support for the ceasefire deal currently on the table at 40 percent, with 27 percent opposed and 33 percent unsure.\n\nBut if Netanyahu is now contemplating whether there is more upside to continuing the war than reaching a ceasefire deal, Biden's speech last week didn't just force Netanyahu to confront that choice - it was also aimed at countering the pressure Netanyahu is now facing to abandon his own government's proposal.\n\n\"I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition,\" Biden said. \"Well, I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes.\"\n\nDespite Netanyahu's remarks that the conditions for ending the war \"have not changed,\" the US State Department said Monday it was \"completely confident\" Israel would go along with the proposal laid out by Biden. \"The only thing standing in the way of an immediate ceasefire today is Hamas,\" Matthew Miller told a press briefing.\n\nBut one key question remains: Will Hamas force Netanyahu to make the choice he now confronts? Or will Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in Gaza, offer Netanyahu an escape hatch of his own making?\n\nHamas said it viewed Biden's speech about the latest Israeli proposal \"positively,\" but has yet to submit its official response.\n\nWhile the latest proposal makes major concessions to close the gap with Hamas's demands - including by offering a clear pathway to a permanent ceasefire - it still falls short of meeting all of the demands.\n\nIt allows an initial 6-week ceasefire period to be extended for as long as the parties need to negotiate a permanent truce that includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal. But it does not require Israel to commit to a permanent ceasefire upfront.\n\nHamas's refusal to compromise on that point and sign off on this deal could let Netanyahu off the hook, and plunge Gaza into many more months of war.", "source": {"uri": "egyptindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Egypt Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yair_Lapid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yair Lapid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Gantz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benny Gantz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bezalel Smotrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Likud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plurality (voting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2024/06/gettyimages-2151065529-2.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

There are other details that the US president did not present to the public.\"\n\nThe proposal on the table includes three phases, according to the communications put out by the White House. The first, set to last six weeks, would see women, elderly and wounded hostages released in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in Israel. The Israeli military will cease fire and withdraw from urban zones and Gazans would be allowed to return to the north of the Strip.\n\nDuring this period, the parties would negotiate the exact parameters of the second phase, which would see the release of the other hostages, soldiers, in return for a long-term cease-fire. Of the roughly 120 hostages remaining in Gaza, Israel says it has confirmed that 37 are dead, though officials say that number is likely higher. The third phase would see the return of bodies held on both sides and the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nThe proposal has been presented and approved by Israel's smaller war cabinet. Israel's public broadcaster Kan revealed Sunday that Netanyahu refused requests by the wider security cabinet to divulge all the details of the proposed deal, fearing that the details could be leaked by the media.\n\n\"Hamas confirms its readiness to deal positively and in a constructive manner with any proposal that is based on the permanent ceasefire and the full withdrawal [of Israeli forces] from the Gaza Strip, the reconstruction [of Gaza], and the return of the displaced to their places, along with the fulfillment of a genuine prisoner swap deal if the occupation clearly announces commitment to such deal,\" Hamas said in a statement Friday.\n\nBen-Gvir, Smotrich threaten to quit\n\nAnticipating the reactions of his far-right partners Friday, Netanyahu's office stressed that the new proposal would enable Israel to reach its war objectives, saying in a statement, \"The prime minister authorized the negotiating team to present an outline to reach this mission, while insisting that the war would not end until all our goals are met. These include bringing back our hostages and eliminating the military and governing capabilities of Hamas.\"\n\nShortly after Biden's announcement, several cabinet ministers came out against the plan.\n\nHard-line Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Friday, \"I spoke with the prime minister and made it clear that I will not be part of a government that would agree to the outline presented, ending the war without the destruction of Hamas and without bringing back all the hostages.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Smotrich met with the rabbis who advise his Religious Zionism party to discuss whether to stay in the government should the proposed deal advance, reported Kan.\n\nLater on Monday, Smotrich accused the war cabinet of \"dangerous management\" of the situation. Addressing members of the right-wing Gvura Forum, Smotrich said, \"If the government decides to adopt this proposal and surrender, we will not be part of it and we will act to replace the failing leadership with a new one.\" Smotrich added, \"I told the prime minister, we, together with the bereaved families and most of the people of Israel, will stand by your side all the way to victory, but will stand against you with all our force if you choose surrender and defeat.\n\nBen-Gvir, who heads the nationalist Jewish Power faction, also threatened to walk out should the proposal be accepted, stating, \"If the prime minister executes the reckless deal under the conditions published today, which mean the end of the war and giving up on eliminating Hamas, Jewish Power will dissolve the government.\"\n\nAfter meeting with the Israeli premier on Monday, Ben-Gvir accused Netanyahu of \"whitewashing\" the details of the latest proposal. \"I asked him if I could look at the draft of the agreement, and he agreed and said that I could come to his office so that I could see the draft with my own eyes,\" Ben Gvir told reporters, adding that he was told by Netanyahu's aides that \"there is no draft\" to look at.\n\nCould Netanyahu's government fall?\n\nNetanyahu could indeed face a choice between reaching a hostage deal and preserving his government.\n\nIt is unclear how real the far right's threat to leave the government is. As Netanyahu's coalition is the most right-wing in Israel's political history, it would be difficult for the parties to explain to their electorates why they toppled it if doing so would prompt new elections.\n\nA poll published last Friday shows that Netanyahu is getting stronger, but would not retain a Knesset majority if the two far-right parties, which together hold 13 seats, leave the government, undercutting Netanyahu's 64-seat majority in the 120-seat chamber.\n\nReligious Zionism and Jewish Power ran on one ticket in the last elections, but it is unclear if the sides could reach a similar agreement next time around. The latest poll predicted that Smotrich's Religious Zionism would get four Knesset seats, the minimum threshold for Knesset entry, but prior polls gave it lower scores.\n\nPolitical safety net\n\nIf Netanyahu goes ahead with the deal, he might find not only the far right, but also members of his own Likud party against him.\n\nDiaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli said Sunday, \"There are certain conditions that we cannot accept, namely ending the war while Hamas still functions as a military and political group. That is impossible.\" He went on, \"This is not a deal, but a joke. Nazi Germany and Japan surrendered on their knees, and so should Hamas.\"\n\nSince Oct. 7, opposition leader Yair Lapid has been calling for new elections, blaming Netanyahu's government for enabling the assault of Hamas with a series of military, intelligence and diplomatic failures. Still, Lapid has also stressed on multiple occasions that his Yesh Atid party would offer Netanyahu a safety net if needed to reach a hostage deal and support Netanyahu should the far right try to disperse the Knesset in an effort to block a deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Benny Gantz, a former IDF chief and opposition figurehead who joined an emergency wartime government in October, recently set June 8 as the deadline for Netanyahu to present a plan for postwar governance of the Gaza Strip or he would quit the government.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"},

mounting civilian death toll, finally allowed that resolution to pass by abstaining from voting\n\nUNITED NATIONS, United States: The United States on Monday announced a draft Security Council resolution supporting the Israel-Hamas ceasefire plan outlined by Joe Biden last week, urging Hamas to accept it.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan,\" said US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\n\nThe draft text, seen by AFP, \"welcomes the new deal announced on May 31, and calls upon Hamas to accept it fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition.\"\n\nBiden outlined on Friday what he called an Israeli plan that in three phases would end the bloody conflict, free all hostages and lead to the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory without Hamas in power.\n\nHowever fissures between the two allies emerged when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stressed that the ongoing war in Gaza would continue until all of Israel's \"goals are achieved,\" including the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities.\n\nIsraeli media have questioned to what extent Biden's ceasefire speech and some crucial details were coordinated with Netanyahu's team, including how long any truce would hold and how many captives would be freed and when.\n\nEarlier Monday, the White House said Biden told the emir of mediator Qatar that he saw Hamas as \"the only obstacle to a complete ceasefire\" in Gaza, and urged him to press the group to accept it.\n\nHamas last week said it viewed Biden's outline \"positively,\" but has since made no official comment on the stalled negotiations, while mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have not announced any new talks.\n\nBefore Biden had made his Friday announcement, Algeria had last week circulated a draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and a halt of the Israeli offensive on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, citing the recent order to that effect from the International Court of Justice.\n\nWashington at the time had said that the text wouldn't be helpful, saying instead direct, on-the-ground negotiations were necessary for a truce.\n\nNo vote is scheduled for either draft resolution.\n\nThe council has struggled to find a unified voice since the war broke out with the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, followed by Israel's retaliatory campaign.\n\nAfter passing two resolutions centered on the need for humanitarian aid to people in Gaza, in March the council passed a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire -- an appeal that had been blocked several times before by the United States.\n\nWashington, increasingly frustrated with the mounting civilian death toll, finally allowed that resolution to pass by abstaining from voting.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That's because Netanyahu wants the complete \"destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities\".\n\nSince 7 October, Israel has killed at least 37,077 Palestinians including over 15,000 children.\n\nGuarantors to the agreement in early May were the UN, the US, Egypt, and Qatar.\n\nThe deal stated that Hamas should release all Israeli detainees in exchange for a number of Palestinian detainees. A \"permanent cessation of military and hostile operations\" would facilitate this, leading to a \"reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip over a period of three to five years - including homes, civilian facilities, and infrastructure - and compensating all those affected begins, under the supervision of several countries and organisations\".\n\nIsrael's genocidal bombardment has destroyed 70% of the homes in Gaza. The targeting of civilian homes and infrastructure is a war crime. Indeed, the International Criminal Court is officially seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as for three Hamas leaders.\n\nThe proposal finished by stating there would then be a \"complete end to the siege of the Gaza Strip\". While Israel withdrew its military bases in Gaza in 2005, it maintains the longstanding occupation through a blockade by land, air, and sea.\n\nIsrael seems intent on rejecting peace.

(AP)\n\nThe ceasefire proposal announced by President Joe Biden has placed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a crossroads, with either path likely to shape the legacy of Israel's longest-serving and deeply divisive leader.\n\nThe proposal offers the possibility of ending Israel's war against Hamas, returning scores of hostages held by the armed group and quieting the northern border with Lebanon.\n\nBut it would also likely shatter Netanyahu's governing coalition, potentially sending him into the opposition and making him more vulnerable to a conviction in his corruption trial. The full withdrawal of Israeli forces called for in the agreement could allow Hamas to claim victory and reconstitute itself.\n\nNetanyahu's rejection of the deal, on the other hand, could deepen Israel's international isolation, worsen ties with an American administration eager to wind down the war and expose him to accusations of having abandoned the hostages to save his own skin.\n\nIt's a conundrum, and that may explain the strange choreography of Biden's Friday night address: An American president, announcing what he says is an Israeli proposal, during the Jewish sabbath, when Israel's political class goes largely silent.\n\nNetanyahu acknowledged the proposal, which has been shared with Hamas through mediators, but then appeared to contradict Biden's remarks. He said Israel remains committed to dismantling Hamas' military and governing capabilities and that any talk of a permanent ceasefire before then was a \"nonstarter.\"\n\nOn Monday, he said the destruction of Hamas is \"part of the proposal\" and was quoted as telling a closed parliamentary hearing that Israel reserves the right to return to war if its objectives are not met.\n\nBut it has never been clear what the destruction of Hamas entails or whether it's even possible. Biden said Israel had degraded Hamas to the point where it could no longer carry out an Oct. 7-style attack, and that that by continuing the war, Israel risked getting bogged down in Gaza.\n\nBut Netanyahu appears to be seeking a much bigger victory.\n\n'NETANYAHU'S ENDGAME IS TO SURVIVE' Netanyahu's critics fear he will reject any ceasefire to appease his ultranationalist governing partners, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. They want to continue the war, fully reoccupy Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there.\n\nThey have already vowed to leave the government if the proposal announced by Biden comes to pass. Netanyahu's political opponents have offered a safety net if he reaches a deal to release hostages but they are unlikely to help him stay in office long-term.\n\n\"Everything that Ben-Gvir and Smotrich demand or threaten to do, you see Netanyahu is very attentive to that,\" said Tal Schneider, an Israeli political commentator. \"Netanyahu's endgame is to survive.\"\n\nNetanyahu's current government, formed in late 2022 after five consecutive elections, is the most nationalist and religious in Israel's history. Months before the war, it pushed policies that entrenched Israel's occupation of the West Bank, deepened the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community's reliance on state subsidies and set in motion an overhaul of the judicial system that tore the country apart.\n\nThe coalition initially had a slim majority of 64 seats in Israel's 120-seat parliament - enough to govern but with a fragility that would keep Netanyahu's fate tied to the whims of any of the smaller parties that form the government.\n\nA VETERAN OF 'DIFFICULT' POLITICS Shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza, Benny Gantz, a former military chief and a top political rival of Netanyahu, joined the government in a show of unity. Netanyahu, Gantz and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant formed a three-man War Cabinet to direct the offensive.\n\nMazal Mualem, a Netanyahu biographer, said that effort largely succeeded in sidelining the ultranationalists and allowing Netanyahu to govern in a more pragmatic mold that has defined his 17 years in office going back to the 1990s.\n\nShe pointed to Israel's limited response to an aerial attack by Iran in April, which Ben-Gvir criticized as \"weak,\" and to a ceasefire and hostage release deal reached with Hamas in November that Smotrich had initially opposed but later voted for.\n\n\"Over the years, Bibi has taught himself to do what he wants to do in difficult political environments,\" she said, referring to Netanyahu by his popular nickname.\n\nBut Gantz has threatened to quit the government unless Netanyahu lays out a postwar plan by June 8, which would leave him far more reliant on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir.\n\nNetanyahu's decision to press ahead with Israel's massive military campaign in Gaza as scores of hostages languish in captivity has opened him up to fierce criticism from many Israelis, including families of the captives. Thousands have joined weekly mass protests.\n\n\"The government of Israel has given up on the hostages,\" Yehi Yehud, who has an adult child being held hostage in Gaza, told Israeli Army Radio. \"Bibi, you don't have the permission or the moral validity to sacrifice them on the altar of your political survival.\"\n\nOPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS Netanyahu's hard-line stance has also weighed heavily on Israel's relations with its closest ally, the United States, which has provided crucial military support but expressed exasperation with civilian casualties and the lack of any realistic Israeli postwar plans.\n\nInternationally, it has exposed Israel to charges of genocide, which it denies, and a potential international arrest warrant against Netanyahu himself.\n\nIn his address on Friday, Biden appeared to be offering Netanyahu a way out: Claim victory by saying a battered Hamas can no longer mount an Oct. 7-style attack, bring all the hostages home and then work with the US and Arab nations to build a new regional security architecture.\n\nBut the fear of losing power could prevail.\n\nNetanyahu has spent years nurturing an image that only he can lead Israel through its myriad diplomatic and security challenges. That legacy suffered a major blow on Oct. 7, with many Israelis directly blaming him for the most devastating security failure in the country's history. Public opinion polls indicate that Netanyahu is trailing behind Gantz and would struggle to form a government if elections were held today.\n\nFor all their threats, his far-right allies are in a similar predicament. They would likely join him in the opposition if early elections are held, losing the power he has granted them over the Israeli police and settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIf Netanyahu can hold his coalition together until the next scheduled elections in 2026, he might be able to rehabilitate his image. His poll numbers have already started to climb from the depths they hit after Oct. 7 as he has presented himself as withstanding international pressure to end the war.\n\nAviv Bushinsky, a former Netanyahu adviser, said Netanyahu's wartime decision-making has less to do with immediate political survival and more with securing a legacy that would not be entirely overshadowed by Oct. 7. That requires some kind of victory over Hamas.\n\n\"From a historical perspective, Netanyahu's only option is to go all the way,\" he said. Ben-Gvir and Smotrich \"are helping him reach that destination, to keep his head above water.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"},

battling intense forest fires in the north of the country that broke out shortly after rocket and drone strikes from neighbouring Lebanon struck the area, forcing the partial evacuation of one town.\n\n\"Firefighting units, assisted by various entities, are working to extinguish the fires,\" Israeli police said in a statement, adding that several homes in Kiryat Shmona had been evacuated.\n\nAn AFP photographer in the northeastern town saw intense blazes engulfing parts of the area bordering Lebanon, the scene of near-daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group on the sidelines of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had deployed reinforcements to support firefighters overwhelmed by the scale of the fires.\n\n\"Six IDF reservist soldiers were lightly injured as a result of smoke inhalation and transferred to a hospital to receive medical treatment,\" the military said.\n\n\"The forces gained control over the locations of fire, and at this stage, no human life is at risk,\" it added.\n\nLeaders of the army's Northern Command had arrived in Kiryat Shmona during the night and the army was \"conducting a situational assessment\" in the sector.\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was closely monitoring, together with the army, the development of the fires, which broke out yesterday after rocket fire and the fall of drones launched from Lebanon.\n\nIn retaliation, the Israeli military announced it had carried out air strikes against what it said were Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.\n\nDraft ceasefire resolution\n\nMeanwhile, the US said it wants the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution backing the proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden to end fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIt circulated a one-page draft text, seen by Reuters, to the 15-member council.\n\nA resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the US, France, Britain, China or Russia to pass.\n\nLatest Middle East stories\n\nThe draft calls on Hamas to accept the deal and \"fully and implement its terms without delay and without condition\".\n\nIt also \"stresses the importance of the parties adhering to the terms of the deal once agreed, with the aim of bringing about a permanent cessation of hostilities\".\n\nThe US proposal comes a week after Algeria proposed a draft Security Council resolution demanding a Gaza ceasefire, release of all hostages held by Hamas and essentially ordering Israel to \"immediately halt its military offensive\" in Rafah.\n\nMr Biden on Friday laid out what he described as a three-phase Israeli proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza in return for the release of Israeli hostages, saying \"it's time for this war to end\" and winning a positive initial reaction from Hamas.\n\n\"Numerous leaders and governments, including in the region, have endorsed this plan and we call on the Security Council to join them in calling for implementation of this deal,\" US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement.\n\nShe urged council members to adopt the resolution.\n\n\"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal,\" she said.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies said in a statement that they \"fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive\" ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt said it was important to \"deal seriously and positively\".", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type":

Around 120 hostages remain in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli assault has killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.\n\nOpinion polls show most Israelis support the war but blame Netanyahu for the security failures when Hamas gunmen rampaged through Israeli communities near Gaza on Oct. 7, and would vote him out if there were an election.\n\nMass street protests have become weekly events, drawing tens of thousands demanding the government do more to bring home hostages seized by Hamas in Oct. 7 and calling for Netanyahu to go.\n\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Peter Graff)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Ensuring their safe passage back from Gaza would be possible while also eliminating the Iran-backed group, he said.\n\nHis comments raised further questions about the three-phase peace plan laid out by Biden, which he said had been put forward by Israel. That proposal detailed a six-week truce involving an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, followed by a focus on an Israeli withdrawal of troops and a permanent ceasefire.\n\nNetanyahu was quick to push back against the idea he was on board with that plan over the weekend, saying the destruction of Hamas's governing and military capabilities remains a non-negotiable target, but one not specifically mentioned in the outlines of the plan released by the White House.\n\nRead more: Israel pushes back against Gaza ceasefire outlined by Biden\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Monday Israel had shown \"a willingness to step forward and do a deal\", and Hamas must now \"come to the table\". The group, designated a terrorist organisation by the US and European Union, has said it's ready \"to deal positively and constructively with any proposal\" based on an indefinite stop to the conflict.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister is under pressure from right-wing allies who have threatened to leave his ruling coalition and bring down the government if he agrees to end the war without dismantling Hamas. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 people demonstrated in Israel over the weekend, calling for an end to the war.\n\nBiden said Israel has battered Hamas enough to prevent it from carrying out another attack like the one on 7 October, when militants killed some 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostages. More than 35,000 Palestinians have died in Israel's subsequent campaign, according to health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations atomic watchdog warned Iran against inflammatory rhetoric after some politicians in the country said engineers could quickly militarise its nuclear programme if instructed to do so.\n\nRecent statements by current and former Iranian officials that its official nuclear doctrine, which prohibits the development of a bomb, could be revised are in focus at the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting this week in Vienna.\n\nAny decision to withdraw from the international agreement regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities and build a weapon could spark a regional arms race and dramatically increase tensions between the Islamic Republic and the West.\n\n\"Many countries have said if Iran gets nuclear weapons, they will do the same,\" International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said. \"Adding nuclear weapons to the cauldron of the Middle East is a very bad idea.\"\n\nLast month a senior legislator and a former foreign minister in Iran told state media the country could change its stance on nuclear weapons if Israel attacked its nuclear infrastructure. The comments were made after Iran and Israel almost went to war in April, when Tehran directly attacked the Jewish state with missiles for the first time.\n\nTurkey's exports to Israel all but ground to a halt in May, after President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's government stopped trade until Gaza received enough humanitarian aid.\n\nShipments to Israel dropped by 99% on an annual basis to $4.4-million, preliminary data from Turkey's main exporters association showed on Monday. The official statistics service TurkStat will publish full trade data for last month, including imports, later in June.\n\nThe Turkish Trade Ministry announced at the start of last month that trade ties would be paused until Israel allowed \"uninterrupted and sufficient flow\" of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where Israel has been waging war against Hamas since October.\n\nTurkish exports to Israel in the first five months had decreased by 40% from the same period of last year, the data showed.\n\nBefore the start of the war, Turkey and Israel were normalising their ties after a decade of tensions. Total trade volume was $6.8-billion last year, according to the Israeli Economy Ministry.\n\nAshraf Creish, the owner of the West Bank restaurant Zest, knew the Israel-Hamas war was going to be hard on business. The steady flow of diners from international organisations and consulates in Jerusalem stopped after 7 October and never came back.\n\nBut he ran into an unexpected hurdle in seeking new customers for his Ramallah cafe, which enjoys a 4.7-star rating on Google: Alphabet blocked new reviews for businesses in Israel and the Palestinian territories since Hamas invaded southern Israel nearly eight months ago.\n\n\"People look up the reviews if they want to go to a restaurant and they don't see it now,\" Creish said in an interview. Zest averaged four or five reviews a week on Google before the war, he said. The steady flow of reviews was \"part of our success\".\n\nThe open-ended Google policy -- meant to guard against trolls and protesters who'd misuse the system during conflicts -- is one example of the struggles facing many small businesses in Israel and the Palestinian territories since the war, which has devastated the economy and upended the tourist trade they depend on. New businesses formed since October told Bloomberg that they can't register on Google Maps.\n\n\"As we have done previously in conflict situations, we put additional protections in place to monitor and prevent content that violates our policies for Maps, including temporarily blocking new reviews, photos, and videos in Israel and Gaza,\" a Google spokesperson said, declining to comment on specific instances. A similar policy was in effect in Russia and Ukraine in 2022, according to media reports at the time, but has since been lifted.\n\nSmall business owners, who weren't notified about the change, have been struggling to find recourse. When Miriam Brainin, the chief operating officer of Tel Aviv job placement agency JobHunt initially approached Google in October over missing customer reviews, she was first told those reviews violated the company's policy. A month later, she was informed that reviews were disabled until further notice but was offered no explanation, according to screenshots shared with Bloomberg.\n\n\"They didn't mention anything about the war. It really made me question myself, that perhaps I had done something wrong,\" Brainin said in a phone interview.\n\nWhile the Google search results for Brainin's and Creish's businesses say that they're open, the war shuttered many companies in Israel, particularly in the first months when hundreds of thousands of Israelis were called up for military reserve duty.\n\n\"My clients look at it and say to themselves, the war broke out and they have no new reviews, they're probably no longer operating,\" Brainin said. \"We aren't a restaurant that you can see with your own two eyes whether it's open or not.\" DM", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type":

With Israel showing no signs of stopping until Hamas is defeated, Biden told Time that people have \"every reason\" to believe Netanyahu is intentionally prolonging the conflict for his own political self-preservation. (RELATED: 'Alternate Version Of Reality': Hamas Could Come Back To Haunt Israel Under Biden's New Gaza Ceasefire Plan)\n\n\"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion. And I would cite that as -- before the war began, the blowback he was getting from the Israeli military for wanting to change the constitu -- change the court,\" Biden told Time, referring to a law passed by Netanyahu's coalition in July 2023 to limit the Israeli Supreme Court's oversight of government, which was struck down in January. \"And so it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence. And whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\"\n\nAsked whether he believed that Netanyahu was responsible for the intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to attack Israel on Oct. 7, Biden said that no \"one person\" was at fault, then segued and said he had a \"major disagreement\" with Netanyahu on the plan for Gaza after the war ends, shutting down the idea of Israeli forces taking control of the region.\n\n\"I don't know how any one person has that responsibility. He was the leader of the country, so therefore, it happened. But he wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up,\" Biden told Time. \"He wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up. That's why there's got to be -- my major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after, what happens after Gaza's over?\"\n\n\"Do Israeli forces go back in? I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work,\" Biden said. \"There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\" (RELATED: US Suspends Gaza Aid Shipments After Biden Admin's Problem-Ridden Floating Pier Damaged By Bad Weather)\n\nBiden and Netanyahu, both political veterans, have known each other for decades but have had an increasingly strained relationship amid disagreements on how Israel's war against Hamas should be carried out. Biden is now advocating for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza amid humanitarian concerns affecting the millions of Palestinians living in the region, but Netanyahu and his coalition believe a ceasefire can only be achieved once Hamas is degraded beyond repair, citing concerns that the terrorist group would never accept true peace.\n\nDefense experts and former U.S. officials previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation that a ceasefire now may allow Hamas to regroup, resurge and eventually attack Israel again in the future. Israel has killed thousands of Hamas fighters but thousands more remain, mostly in southern Gaza but also in the central and northern regions.\n\nThe two world leaders have had several tense phone calls about the war since Oct. 7, with Biden sometimes becoming confused or upset with Netanyahu's plans and remarks, even abruptly hanging up on Netanyahu out of anger on one occasion. Netanyahu, for his part, has apparently become upset with how the Biden administration is trying to mitigate Israel's war aims, reportedly declaring during a war cabinet meeting in May that Israel is not a \" vassal state of the United States.\"\n\nThe White House and the Israeli Embassy to the U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The unresolved state of the war between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks makes no one happy, particularly as the conflict threatens to metastasize and destabilize the wider Middle East.\n\nThus, the president's fortunes were looking up on Friday when he sprung a surprise: The White House was putting together a three-part cease-fire plan that, apparently, Israel supported.\n\n\"For the past several months, my negotiators of foreign policy, intelligence community and the like have been relentlessly focused not just on a cease-fire that would inevitably be fragile and temporary but on a durable end to the war,\" Biden said in remarks at the White House.\n\n\"That's been the focus: a durable end to this war. One that brings all the hostages home, ensures Israel's security, creates a better 'day after' in Gaza without Hamas in power and sets the stage for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, after intensive diplomacy carried out by my team and my many conversations with leaders of Israel, Qatar, and Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries, Israel has now offered -- Israel has offered -- a comprehensive new proposal.\"\n\nIf only someone had bothered informing Israel about the tenets of the agreement.\n\nIn remarks to NBC News reported Monday evening, a senior Israeli official said Biden's description of the proposal was \"not accurate\" and the U.S. president had laid out only a partial version of what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government would accept.\n\n\"Israel has not changed its conditions to reach a permanent cease-fire,\" the official said.\n\n\"That will only happen after our objectives are met including destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities,\" the official said.\n\nNBC News reported that the official \"also said that while the White House described the plan as originating from Israel, it was actually a proposal put forward by mediators to which Israel had made amendments and changes.\"\n\n\"It's strange that they say it's an Israeli proposal and at the same time that Israel needs to agree to it,\" the official said.\n\nOver the weekend, reports out of Israel indicated that, while Netanyahu's government was on board with the framework of an agreement, it was less than enthusiastic about the deal.\n\nOphir Falk, Netanyahu's chief foreign policy adviser, said that it was \"a deal we agreed to -- it's not a good deal, but we dearly want the hostages released, all of them.\"\n\nHowever, as NBC News noted, the idea of a permanent cease-fire was deemed a \"nonstarter\" by Netanyahu on Sunday. He also told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee that the version of the cease-fire that Biden presented was only \"partial\" on Monday.\n\n\"The war will be stopped for the purpose of returning hostages and then we will proceed with further discussions,\" the prime minister said, according to spokesman David Mencer.\n\n\"There are other details that the U.S. president did not present to the public.\"\n\nAnd, as the outlet reported, \"another U.S. official also pushed back Monday, telling NBC News that Biden was merely describing the Israeli proposal but acknowledging the pressure Netanyahu would face from far-right officials.\"\n\nLet's leave aside what qualifies as \"far-right\" in the NBC News vernacular. (Translation: Any Israeli politician or minister duly concerned about the Jewish state's continued security and autonomy.) This is pretty damning stuff, evidence that Biden announced a cease-fire slam-dunk that was, at best, more like an adumbration sketched out on a pencil by all sides, then filled in with details thoroughly untenable to Israel by the Biden administration.\n\nThe whole to-do could best be summed up, in short, by this X post:\n\nAnother X user noted the \"sheer perfidy\" of the Biden administration claiming the plan was Israel's idea and then effectively taking it to the U.N. Security Council in order to ram what was supposedly Israel's own plan down its throat:\n\nAnd yet, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby didn't seem to understand what the big deal was when reporters grilled him on the viability of the plan on Monday.\n\n\"The Israeli foreign minister himself acknowledged that this was the Israeli proposal,\" he said.\n\nWhen he was asked \"what other gaps, as Netanyahu referred to them, are there between the U.S. and Israel,\" Kirby responded, \"I don't know what gaps you're referring to. I mean, I've heard different statements coming out of Israel.\"\n\nIf that doesn't say it all about the fantasy land in which Biden and his team continue to live -- particularly when it comes to Gaza, where they're very obviously trying to have their cake while eating it, too, and with predictable results -- I don't quite know what will.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_douglas_golden@westernjournal.com", "name": "C.

Ensuring their safe return from Gaza would be possible while eliminating the Iran-backed group, he said.\n\nHis comments raised further questions about the three-phase peace plan presented by Biden, which he said was proposed by Israel. This proposal detailed a six-week truce involving an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, followed by a withdrawal of Israeli troops and a permanent ceasefire.\n\nNetanyahu was quick to counter the idea that he agreed with the plan over the weekend, saying that destroying Hamas's government and military capabilities remained a non-negotiable goal, but that he was not specifically mentioned in the outline of the plan published by the government. White House.\n\nLearn more: Israel rejects Gaza ceasefire outlined by Biden\n\nU.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Monday that Israel has shown its willingness to move forward and reach a deal, and that Hamas must now come to the table. The group, designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, declared itself ready to treat in a positive and constructive manner any proposal based on an indefinite cessation of the conflict.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister is under pressure from his right-wing allies who have threatened to leave his ruling coalition and overthrow the government if he agrees to end the war without dismantling Hamas. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 people demonstrated in Israel this weekend, calling for an end to the war.\n\nBiden said Israel had hit Hamas enough to prevent it from carrying out another attack like the one on Oct. 7, when militants killed some 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostages. More than 35,000 Palestinians died in the ensuing Israeli campaign, according to health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations atomic watchdog has warned Iran against inflammatory rhetoric after some of the country's politicians said engineers could quickly weaponize its nuclear program if asked.\n\nRecent declarations Current and former Iranian officials have argued that the official nuclear doctrine, which prohibits the development of a bomb, could be revised, are the focus of attention at the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting this week in Vienna.\n\nAny decision to withdraw from the international agreement regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities and build a weapon could trigger a regional arms race and significantly increase tensions between the Islamic Republic and the West.\n\nMany countries have said that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, they will do the same, said International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. Adding nuclear weapons to the Middle East cauldron is a terrible idea.\n\nLast month, a senior Iranian lawmaker and former foreign minister told state media that the country could change its position on nuclear weapons if Israel attacked its nuclear infrastructure. The comments were made after Iran and Israel nearly went to war in April, when Tehran directly attacked the Jewish state with missiles for the first time.\n\nTurkey's exports to Israel came to a virtual halt in May, after President Recep Tayyip Erdoan's government halted trade until Gaza received enough humanitarian aid.\n\nShipments to Israel fell 99% on an annual basis to $4.4 million, preliminary data from Turkey's association of major exporters showed Monday. The official statistics service TurkStat will release last month's full trade data, including imports, later in June.\n\nTurkish Ministry of Commerce announcement early last month, trade relations would be suspended until Israel allowed an uninterrupted and sufficient flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where Israel has been waging a war against Hamas since October.\n\nTurkish exports to Israel in the first five months fell by 40% compared to the same period last year, according to the data.\n\nBefore the war began, Turkey and Israel were normalizing relations after a decade of tensions. The total trade volume amounted to $6.8 billion last year, according to the Israeli Ministry of Economy.\n\nAshraf Creish, owner of Zest restaurant in the West Bank, knew the war between Israel and Hamas was going to be tough on business. The constant flow of guests from international organizations and consulates to Jerusalem stopped after October 7 and never returned.\n\nBut he ran into an unexpected obstacle in finding new customers for his Ramallah cafe, which boasts a 4.7-star rating on Google: Alphabet blocked new reviews for businesses in Israel and the Palestinian territories since Hamas invaded southern Israel almost eight months ago.\n\nPeople look at reviews if they want to go to a restaurant and don't see them now, Creish said in an interview. Zest received an average of four or five reviews a week on Google before the war, he said. The constant flow of reviews has been part of our success.\n\nGoogle's no-holds-barred policy, intended to guard against trolls and protesters who would abuse the system during conflicts, is an example of the struggles facing many small businesses in Israel and the Palestinian territories since the war, which devastated the economy and disrupted the tourist trade. depend on. New businesses created since October told Bloomberg they couldn't list on Google Maps.\n\nAs we have done previously in conflict situations, we put additional protections was set up to monitor and prevent content that violates our Maps policies, including temporarily blocking new reviews, photos and videos in Israel and Gaza, a Google spokesperson said, declining to comment on cases specific. A similar policy was in effect in Russia and Ukraine in 2022, according to media reports at the time, but has since been lifted.\n\nSmall business owners, who were not informed of the change, are struggling to find recourse. When Miriam Brainin, director of operations at Tel Aviv job placement agency JobHunt, initially contacted Google in October about missing customer reviews, she was initially told that the reviews violated Google policy. 'business. A month later, she was informed that the reviews were disabled until further notice, but no explanation was offered, according to screenshots shared with Bloomberg.\n\nThey didn't mention anything about the war. It really made me wonder if maybe I had done something wrong, Brainin said in a telephone interview.\n\nWhile Google search results for Brainins and Creish's businesses indicate they are open, the war closed many businesses in Israel, particularly in the first months when hundreds of thousands of Israelis were called up. in the military reserve.\n\nMy clients look at it and say war has broken out and they don't have any new reviews, they probably don't work anymore, Brainin said. We are not a restaurant that you can see with your own eyes, whether it is open or not.

But since Biden outlined the potential agreement, Netanyahu and his close aides have said Israel would not agree to a permanent ceasefire until it achieves its goals, which include \"destroying\" Hamas's capabilities.\n\nUnder the potential deal, the two sides would negotiate the terms for a permanent ceasefire during the first phase. A senior Israeli official told Axios that Netanyahu was \"killing\" the ambiguity by ruling out a permanent truce.\n\n\"Instead of keeping things ambiguous, his statements are pushing Hamas to ask for more clarification, making it harder to get a deal,\" a second Israeli official said. The official added that it appeared Netanyahu was trying to placate Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, who are threatening to resign and bring down the coalition government if the war cabinet agrees to the deal.\n\nNetanyahu also has his own reasons for not wanting to pause the genocidal war in Gaza.

"RAFAH, Palestine: Israel on Tuesday mourned four captives reported dead in Gaza by the army amid growing doubts and international pressure over a plan for a ceasefire and hostage release deal outlined by US President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the besieged Palestinian territory, Israeli strikes continued early Tuesday, particularly in Bureij in central Gaza where local hospital sources reported several deaths.\n\nIn northern Israel, firefighters and troops were battling forest blazes after rocket fire from neighbouring Lebanon, with the border area the scene of near-daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli army and the Hezbollah militant group, an ally of Hamas, since the start of the war in Gaza nearly eight months ago.\n\nIsrael's military on Monday announced the deaths in Gaza of four hostages seized during the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, naming them as Chaim Perry, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper and Nadav Popplewell.\n\nTheir bodies were still in the hands of Hamas, it added.\n\nCooper, 84, Metzger, 80, and Perry, 80, were abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz while Israeli-British citizen Popplewell, 51, was kidnapped from the Nirim kibbutz.\n\nBritish foreign minister David Cameron said he was \"greatly saddened to hear about the death\" of Popplewell, adding: \"we reiterate our demand for Hamas to send all hostages home\".\n\n\"They should have returned alive to their country and their families,\" the Hostages Families Forum said.\n\nIntense pressure\n\nNetanyahu, a hawkish veteran leading a fragile hard-right coalition government, is under intense domestic pressure from multiple sides.\n\nRelatives and supporters of hostages have staged mass protests demanding a truce deal -- but his far-right coalition allies are threatening to bring down the government if he agrees to that.\n\nBiden on Friday presented what he labelled an Israeli three-phase plan that would end the bloody conflict, free all hostages and lead to the reconstruction of the devastated Palestinian territory without Hamas in power.\n\nHowever, Netanyahu's office stressed that the war would continue until all of Israel's \"goals are achieved\", including the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities.\n\nThe G7 group of countries said in a statement its leaders \"fully endorse\" the deal pushed by Biden, and called on Hamas to accept it.\n\nHamas on

The coalition, including United Torah Judaism, balances far-right opposition. Public opinion in Israel remains divided on the ceasefire proposal.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's biggest coalition partner said on Tuesday it would support a prospective deal to free hostages from Hamas captivity even if it entails an overhaul of Israel's Gaza war strategy. The statement by Shas, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish party that holds 11 of parliament's 120 seats, followed similar remarks on Monday by Yitzhak Goldknopf, leader of the second such party in the coalition, United Torah Judaism, which has seven seats.\n\n\"Our position is that there is nothing greater than the value of life and the commandment to redeem captives, because their lives face a real and present danger,\" Goldknopf, Israel's housing minister, said in a statement. Similarly citing a religious obligation, Shas pledged \"full support\" to the proposal. It encouraged Netanyahu and his war cabinet to \"withstand all pressures for the end of returning the hostages\".\n\nThe combined support of the two parties - which hold 18 of the 72 seats controlled by Netanyahu's expanded emergency government - could help offset opposition by far-right partners to a U.S.-backed proposal for winding down the Gaza war. The deal's opponents - the Jewish Power party of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and the Religious Zionism party of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - control 13 seats and have threatened to quit the government over the deal.\n\nThey worry that the proposal would halt efforts to defeat the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Netanyahu has said Israel would not stop the war without toppling and disarming Hamas - while Hamas insists that any deal must end the Israeli offensive against it in Gaza. Though the Israeli public has rallied around the war triggered by a Hamas cross-border killing and kidnapping spree on Oct. 7, support has eroded amid worry for the 120 remaining hostages, more than a third of whom are believed to have died.\n\nAccording to a poll aired by public broadcaster Kan on Sunday, 40% of Israelis support the ceasefire proposal, which was unveiled by U.S. President Joe Biden last week, while 27% are opposed and 33% undecided. Forty percent of respondents said they believe that if Israel enters the deal that would spell an end to the war, while 34% predicted a resumption of fighting and 26% were undecided.\n\nAsked if Israel would succeed in toppling Hamas, 32% said yes, 42% said no and 26% were undecided, Kan found.

But senior US officials insisted the hug would allow Biden to counsel Netanyahu and shape the Israeli military campaign.\n\nIt did delay the initial Israeli ground invasion of Gaza and contain major regional fallout, and it has so far spared Lebanon a full-scale Israeli military campaign -- but that's no relief for Palestinians suffering in Gaza and the families of the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\nIn the eight months since, Biden has tried to cajole, coax and pressure Netanyahu to engage in discussions about the day after. The White House set deadlines and even red lines -- all of which faded. Biden's critics on the left say he never used real leverage. The right lambasted him for holding up even one shipment of weapons to Israel.\n\nOn Friday, Biden finally deployed the other bit of political capital he banked when he went to Israel in October -- high approval from Israelis grateful for his support. Biden went over Netanyahu's head and addressed the Israeli people directly in what was the most important part of his speech.\n\n\"To the people of Israel, let me say this\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I ask you to take a step back and think what will happen if this moment is lost. We can't lose this moment,\" he said. \"Indefinite war in the pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will only bog down Israel in Gaza.\"\n\nBiden warned of Israel's increased isolation in the world. Most importantly, by talking about potential calm on the border with Lebanon and the prospect of normalisation with Saudi Arabia, he offered a positive way forward for a country whose mood has increasingly darkened amid strategic drift, external pressures and internal divisions.\n\nAn estimated crowd of at least 100,000 Israelis protested at the weekend in Tel-Aviv, many holding up placards with the words: \"Take the deal\" and \"Biden save [the hostages] from Netanyahu\".\n\nFrustration with Netanyahu was evident in how the US administration choreographed what followed Biden's statement: an immediate chorus of voices in support of his message, including former president Barack Obama and the leaders of the G7, and a series of phone calls to regional allies. There was even an unusual joint statement with Egypt and Qatar calling on both Hamas and Israel to finalise the deal.\n\nCrucially, US secretary of state Antony Blinken called ministers in Netanyahu's own war cabinet, Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, and almost suggested a fait accompli by \"commending Israel's readiness to conclude a deal\".\n\nMuch of the commentary has centred on whether this was indeed an Israeli proposal as Biden stated. But it's a moot point. This is the deal that the American president has now put on the table, along with his credibility. Many of the details still need to be worked out, including the thorniest one: how to move from the first phase of a ceasefire to a permanent cessation of hostilities.\n\nNetanyahu's far-right ministers have threatened to quit. Another minister rejected the deal and said: \"No surrender, not to American pressure, not to anything.\"\n\nIn June 1982, a few days after Israel invaded Lebanon, Amos Oz, the Israeli writer and peace activist, wrote about Menachem Begin's approach to diplomacy. \"Never before has Israel been assaulted by an almost daily bombardment of plans for agreements, suggested solutions, peace proposals\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The Begin government reacts to all of them as though to an evil barrage of Katyusha [rockets].\"\n\nFour decades later, these words still ring true. Netanyahu will have to choose between rebuffing the American president to save his rightwing coalition or accepting the deal for the sake of the hostages and his country's long-term strategic interest. He could theoretically survive politically by forming a new broad-based coalition. He could buy time by accepting phase one and reneging on phase two. So could Hamas. Washington believes Netanyahu will find a way to take the deal. Much now depends on the response of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza.\n\nMore than just the latest version of a possible plan, Biden's proposal is the last option to find a way out of the dark tunnel of war.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type":

forward to end the ongoing catastrophe in Gaza and full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian Territory.\n\n\"Malaysia has consistently called for a permanent and effective ceasefire to bring an immediate end to the killing of Palestinians and the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\"In this context, the three-phase proposal announced by President Joe Biden for a complete ceasefire, release of captives from both sides, efforts towards a permanent end to hostilities, and a comprehensive reconstruction plan for Palestine is a step in the right direction,\" said the statement.\n\nMalaysia also urged the international community to prioritise the immediate and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to Palestinians and reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nIt emphasised that Malaysia's steadfast support and full solidarity with the Palestinian people remain unwavering, including their right to self-determination and the creation of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nInternational media reported that Biden on May 31 presented a three-phase deal proposed by Israel to the Palestinian group, Hamas, that he said would end hostilities in the besieged Gaza Strip and secure the release of hostages held in the coastal enclave.\n\nHamas reportedly said it would \"respond positively to any proposal that includes a permanent cease-fire, a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction efforts, the return of the displaced, and the completion of a comprehensive hostage exchange deal\". -- Bernama", "source": {"uri":

The draft resolution, which was circulated among the 15-member council and seen by Reuters, calls for Hamas to immediately agree to and implement the terms of the deal to ensure a permanent cessation of hostilities.\n\nThis move by the US follows a separate draft resolution by Algeria last week, which called for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and demanded that Israel cease its military operations in Rafah. Unlike the Algerian proposal, the US draft specifically backs President Biden's three-phase cease-fire initiative, which includes the release of Israeli hostages as a key component.\n\nPresident Biden outlined his proposal last Friday, emphasizing the urgency of ending the conflict and citing a positive initial response from Hamas. \"It's time for this war to end,\" Biden stated as he described the planned phases aimed at de-escalating one of the most intense confrontations in recent years.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has strongly advocated for the resolution, urging council members to adopt it swiftly to show unified support for the cease-fire deal. \"We must speak with one voice in support of this deal,\" Thomas-Greenfield said, highlighting the broad international backing the plan has already received.\n\nThe leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations have also expressed their full endorsement of the proposed cease-fire and hostage-release agreement. Additionally, foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Egypt have recognized the importance of dealing seriously and positively with the US initiative.\n\nThe US draft resolution requires at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes from any of the permanent members of the Security Council -- which include the US, France, Britain, China, and Russia -- to pass.", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Many of these voters reside in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin, which Mr Biden must win to secure another term.\n\nThe polls also indicate why Biden is making a conscious effort to distance

The address has been trending over social media, as this will be Netanyahu's fourth address, the most of any foreign leader. No doubt there's bound to be some noteworthy reactions from the antisemitic far-left, especially as Democrats find themselves in disarray when it comes to supporting Israel.\n\nSources confirmed to outlets such as The Hill, POLITICO, and Punchbowl News. The report from POLITICO mentioned a curious detail, which is that President Joe Biden will be attending the G-7 address in Italy on such a date.\n\nAmong the far-left members expressing their disapproval included Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who shared a lengthy post on Friday when news came in of the invitation from Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nSanders himself even reminded that he is in support of how the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced last month that it was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.\n\nIt does not yet appear that members of the anti-Israel Squad have reacted to the news yet, though it's almost certain they will boycott the address and make their displeasure quite known in the process. Last July, Israeli President Isaac Herzog addressed Congress, with Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Cori Bush (D-MO) issuing a joint statement that they would boycott the speech. They also used an anti-Israel narrative, as they claimed Israel was \"an apartheid state.\"\n\nThe news also comes as Biden announced a ceasefire plan on Friday between Israel and Hamas following the October 7 attack that Hamas perpetrated last year against our ally in the Middle East. In addition to a litany of concerns, such as how American taxpayers will pay to help rebuild the Gaza strip, Israeli officials are also claiming that Biden's description of the plan are not accurate.\n\nAs NBC News reported earlier on Monday:\n\nJERUSALEM -- President Joe Biden's description of Israel's cease-fire proposal was \"not accurate,\" a senior Israeli official has told NBC News, as doubts grew Monday over the U.S. ally's stance on the deal.\n\nBiden said in a surprise announcement Friday that he was outlining a truce proposal that had been made by Israel and passed by mediators to Hamas.\n\nBut the official called into question Biden's description of the cease-fire offer as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- facing competing pressures from Washington and families of hostages on one side and right-wing ministers threatening to bring down his government on the other -- said that Biden had put forward only a partial version of the Israeli proposal.\n\nThe official specifically disputed that Israel had agreed to fully withdraw its troops from the Gaza Strip as part of a deal to free the 125 or so hostages remaining in captivity there.\n\n\"Israel has not changed its conditions to reach a permanent cease-fire. That will only happen after our objectives are met including destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities,\" the official said.\n\nThe official also said that while the White House described the plan as originating from Israel, it was actually a proposal put forward by mediators to which Israel had made amendments and changes.\n\n\"It's strange that they say it's an Israeli proposal and at the same time that Israel needs to agree to it,\" the official said. The official added that Israel was awaiting Hamas' formal response to the proposal.\n\nThe official X account for the Prime Minister of Israel has also posted since Friday that claims about Israel agreeing to a ceasefire are \"incorrect.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_downs@townhall.com", "name": "Rebecca Downs",

Washington officials are calling it the \"last chance\" for an agreement.\n\nBen-Gvir and Smotrich, the minister of national security and the minister of finance respectively, threatened Saturday evening to dissolve the ruling political coalition and cause the government to fall if Israel were to agree to Biden's proposal for a temporary truce in the Gaza Strip. These two ministers are from the Religious Zionism bloc, and Ben-Gvir is from one of its most dangerous components, Jewish Power. They are the Israeli equivalent of neo-Nazis and were brought into the Netanyahu government in late 2022 to provide it a majority in the 120-member Knesset or Parliament. Religious Zionism-Jewish Power won 14 seats, giving Netanyahu and his other allies a 64-seat majority.\n\nIn parliamentary systems, coalitions are often put together after the election, and they require a majority of seats, otherwise the prime minister could lose an important vote or be subject to a vote of no confidence. When that happens he or she has to call new elections and the government is said to \"fall.\" For instance, just last fall on December 11, the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki lost a vote of no confidence. He was succeeded by Donald Tusk.\n\nThe closest equivalent in the American system regards the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who likewise has to keep the confidence of a majority. Kevin McCarthy failed to do so and was replaced by Mike Johnson.\n\nSo the long and the short of it is that if Smotrich and Ben-Gvir pull out of Netanyahu's cabinet, his government would fall and snap elections would be called. Polling suggests that the right wing Netanyahu's centrist rivals would be elected by a landslide and so he would lose the prime ministership. Netanyahu is on trial for corruption, and those trials could then proceed apace, once he was out of office, and he might well go to jail. Some Israeli political observers believe he is prolonging the Gaza campaign for his own personal reasons, to remain a free man.\n\nPBS NewsHour: \"Netanyahu clashes with Biden over conditions for permanent cease-fire in Gaza\"\n\nSmotrich said on his social media sites, \"I have spoken just now with the head of government and I made clear to him that I would not be any part of a government that agreed to the suggested outline, and which would end the war without annihilating Hamas and returning all the hostages.\" In the past, Smotrich has said that returning the hostages was not a priority for him, so I think his position is actually driven by the prospect of annihilating \"Hamas,\" by which he means the Palestinian people, as he has often made clear.\n\nSmotrich added, \"We will never agree to end the war before Hamas is annihilated, nor will we agree to undo the achievements of the war so far by withdrawing the Israeli army and allowing the return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip, nor will we accept the wholesale release of terrorists who, God forbid, would return to kill Jews.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We demand the continuation of the fighting until the elimination of Hamas and the return of all the abductees, the creation of a completely different security reality in Gaza and Lebanon, the return of all residents to their homes in the north and south, and a huge investment in the accelerated development of these areas [for Jews].\"\n\nBen-Gvir of the Black Shirt-like \"Jewish Power\" bloc also said he would withdraw from the government: \"The deal,the details of which were published today, means the end of the war and giving up on the destruction of Hamas. This is a humiliating deal, a victory for terrorism and a security threat to Israel. Approving it does not represent absolute victory, but absolute defeat.\" He warned that if Netanyahu approved the Biden deal, \"the Jewish Power [Otzma Yehudit] party will dissolve the government.\"\n\nOpposition politician Gideon Sa'ar, head of the small New Hope party and an ally of opposition leader Benny Gantz, also said that any agreement that ends with Hamas being the ruling and military power in Gaza means that the average Israeli citizen would continue to live under threat. He said it would be a victory for Hamas and a defeat for Israel with far-reaching consequences.\n\nReligious Zionism's Orit Strock, Minister of Settlements and National Missions, piled on, rejecting the Biden Plan. She said, \"I did not find a fundamental difference between Biden's 'new' and 'promising' plan and the previous plan. Another surrender deal that saves Hamas, begins the countdown to the next massacre, and leaves the hostages with no means of being released other than ending the war.\"\n\nA leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, struck out at Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, saying \"\"Ben Gvir and Smotrich's threats (to topple the government) are negligent and represent a complete abandonment of national security, the hostages, and the residents of the north and south. This is the worst and most corrupt government in the country's history. As far as they are concerned, the war here can continue forever. Zero responsibility, zero management: a complete failure.\"\n\nLapid's ally Benny Gantz, who is serving in the war cabinet (essentially a government of national unity during the crisis), tried to counteract the bitter and defiant words addressed to Joe Biden by the members of the far right wing current government: \"The United States in general, and since the beginning of the war in particular, has demonstrated its commitment to Israel's security and the return of the hostages. We feel full appreciation for President Biden and all our American friends for their support.\"\n\nHe seemed to commit to the Biden plan, and called for an emergency meeting of the war cabinet with the Israeli negotiators who are talking indirectly to the Palestinian leadership through the mediation of Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. Gantz also played to the section of the Israeli public that prioritizes the return of hostages: \"Tonight, I would like to fortify the families of the hostages and tell them that I and my friends are committed to the return of their loved ones, and that this goal is the highest moral obligation, and a goal with clear priority on [policy] the timetable.\"\n\nMany Israelis are demonstrating against the extremist Netqnyahu government, demanding that he prioritize securing the release of the hostages, and Gantz appears to believe that there is a constituency for this position in the Israeli public.\n\nI take away from this reporting, and from the remarks of the politicians, that as long as the far right remains in power, Biden's plan is dead in the water. The centrists, such as Gantz and Lapid, would probably go for it if they were in power, but they aren't. The main hope for an end to hostilities appears to be the fall of the Netanyahu government over some issue that inflames passions among his coalition partners, such that parties with 5 or more members withdraw from it.\n\nAnother possibility is that Biden could actually stop supplying the Israelis with arms and ammunition on a daily basis. They have run out of ammunition of their own and need American supplies. But that step would require that Biden show an independence and courage on the Israel issue that he has never displayed before.", "source": {"uri": "juancole.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

incursion, despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire.\n\nNearly eight months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in its latest ruling has ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its operation in Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "authors":

At the same time, more than 100,000 people demonstrated in Israel over the weekend, calling for an end to the war.\n\nBiden, speaking in a rare sit own interview with Time Magazine, said there was reason to conclude Netanyahu is prolonging the war in Gaza due to his own political considerations.\n\nMeanwhile, officials from Qatar, which is helping mediate the talks, said Israel has yet to provide a position on the plan that is accepted by its full coalition government. A Foreign Ministry spokesman released a statement Tuesday calling on countries to press both sides to accept Biden's plan.\n\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.\n\nMilestone Alert!

That idea had also received support from the US.\n\nNational Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Monday that Israel has demonstrated a willingness to accept President Biden's proposed ceasefire and prisoner release agreement.\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, promptly emphasized that Israel would continue the war that was started by the October 7 attack until all of its \"goals are achieved,\" including the obliteration of Hamas's capacity for both military and government.\n\nThe degree to which Biden's speech and some other important details -- such as the duration of any truce and the number and timing of detainee releases -- were planned with Netanyahu's team has been called into question by Israeli media.\n\nElection-related stress\n\nPresident Biden is reportedly pressing for a revised peace proposal because he wants to put an end to the Gaza war before November's presidential elections.\n\nRecent surveys highlight the mounting internal pressure -- fueled by Israeli atrocities in Gaza -- on President Biden's political prospects. According to the polls, 71% of Democrats and independents leaning Democratic (71%) have little to no faith in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a rise from 56% in 2023.\n\nAccording to a different survey, 79 percent of Arab Americans think poorly of President Biden, while 56 percent think poorly of Donald Trump. Many of these people live in states that are crucial to Mr. Biden's chances of winning another term, such Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nThe polls also show why Biden is deliberately trying to put Netanyahu behind him.\n\nThere are some who surmise that the Biden administration is trying to salvage Netanyahu's reputation by portraying the peace plan as an Israeli initiative.", "source": {"uri":

The three-stage U.S. plan reflects an American interest in ending the fighting. However, its message, incredibly admonishing Israel equally to Hamas, emboldens the terrorist organization, Hizbullah, and Iran and serves to weaken Israel profoundly in public perception. In the Middle East, perception is essential, and the U.S. position appears to back Hamas's ultimate control in Gaza while leaving Israelis vulnerable to more extensive and more lethal assaults.\n\nBiden's \"cessation of hostilities,\" \"road map,\" and \"peace plan\" attempted to inculcate Israelis with another false conceptzia [false assumption], reminiscent of the belief in 2023 that Hamas sought coexistence and the Oslo Peace Accords of the 1990s would bring peace. Biden's 15-minute summary statement concluded, \"Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should take this deal.\"\n\nBiden's \"Peace Now\" approach echoes Israel's failed far-left \"Peace Now\" movement that led to the fatal Oslo two-state experiment that exploded in the October 7 Gaza atrocities and served as the catalyst for hostilities from Beirut, to the Golan, to the Red Sea, and even to Iranian rocket launchers aimed at Israel.\n\nThe U.S. plan ignores the imminent dangers of the strategic and existential threat posed by Hizbullah to Israel's north, an area already evacuated by 100,000 Israelis. Iran's Hizbullah and Houthi proxies would be encouraged by Israeli submission to Hamas with an immediate ceasefire for six weeks. The Biden plan provides no guarantee of a more comprehensive regional cease-fire. Like the Oslo process, Biden's \"Peace Now\" plan has no end of conflict in sight.\n\nOver the course of the Hamas war, the Biden administration has repeatedly admonished Israel over its retaliation (\"take the win\"), the use of precision munitions, the attack on Rafah, and civilian casualties based on Hamas's exaggerated figures. Now, too, Biden's plan publicly admonishes Israel rather than standing with its regional ally. Biden's even-handed treatment of Hamas and Israel engenders a moral equivalence between a jihadist organization and a democratic ally.\n\nRepeating the Oslo period fata morgana, Biden laid out his grand vision for peace as if the two sides in the Gaza war are playing by the same rules. The American administration plan suggests negotiations with an ISIS-like terror organization just eight months after it massacred 1,300 civilians in Israel and raped and abducted hundreds more.\n\nThe first phase of the plan calls for the trade only of some live hostages and some of the dead hostages' remains in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian security prisoners. Hamas's psychopathic leader, Yahya Sinwar, and some 1,000 Palestinian prisoners were exchanged in the Gilad Shalit deal in 2011.\n\nBiden's moral equivalence weakens Israel in the West as well as in the Middle East, strengthens Hamas and other Iranian proxies, and encourages more attacks on Israel and other Western targets with greater energy and confidence.\n\nThis false moral equivalence also extends to Qatar, Biden's mediator and ally. \"Egypt and Qatar have assured me,\" the president said, \"that they are continuing to work to ensure that Hamas [is held] accountable for its obligations.\" Biden vowed, in a statement of moral equivalence and a hint of distrust of Israel, \"The United States will help ensure that Israel lives up to its obligations as well.\"\n\nQatar is Hamas. The sheikhdom supports the jihadi Muslim Brotherhood, funds Hamas terrorism, and is home to Hamas's political leadership. Qatar is behind the Islamist propaganda war against Israel and the West via its global media conglomerate, Al Jazeera, and the radicalization of higher education in both curriculum and student activism in the West and elsewhere. Qatar is part of the problem, and by suggesting it mediate between Hamas and Israel, Biden co-mingles enemies and allies.\n\nBeyond its conceptual faults, Biden's plan raises more questions than solutions.\n\nIts proposed Stage One ceasefire would save thousands of remaining Hamas fighters and leadership who hide in tunnels in the Gaza Strip. As of now, only 30 to 35 percent of Hamas fighters have been eliminated, and 65 percent of its underground tunnels remain intact, according to American intelligence assessments. During humanitarian pauses in hostilities on Israel's side since October 7, demanded by the West and the international community, hundreds of Hamas rockets continued to rain down on Israeli population centers.\n\nThe call for an immediate ceasefire will only reassure Hamas of its \"Allahu Akbar eternal life\" and grant it legitimacy to extend the cease-fire for months or years while it rearms and reasserts power. With two-thirds of Hamas fighters and leaders still active, how would the plan end Hamas's rule?\n\nWhat happens in Biden's proposed plan during its \"Second Stage\" is also unclear if the two sides fail to agree, with Israel still committed to a ceasefire. In such a case, Hamas's attacks would likely continue indeterminately, continuing its strategy of attrition.\n\nThe U.S. administration plan puts more pressure on Israel than on Hamas. Israel, as a democratic country, is under the unrelenting hyper-scrutiny of the international community - the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the International Court of Justice. In contrast, Hamas remains untethered and uncommitted to any rules-based order. This asymmetrical situation leaves Hamas to do as it chooses while tying Israel's hands in the international legal and diplomatic community, which has already determined brazenly and baselessly that de facto, Israel has become Hamas, and Hamas has become Israel.\n\nRegionally, by applying public pressure on Israel, the plan conveys the message to the Middle East, from Riyadh to Tehran, that America is reining in Israel while releasing Hamas to continue attacking as a military and political terror force. Arab interlocutors have told this author that without the clear defeat of Hamas and Israeli control in Gaza, no viable \"day after\" alternative is possible.\n\nWhat Arab state (Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, or others) would participate in a \"day after\" plan while Hamas is still in the driver's seat? This would be the case should the U.S. plan be implemented.\n\nDespite the President's declaration that his \"Peace Now\" deal would be part of a regional security network to counter Iran, the opposite is true. If Israel is unable to defeat Hamas decisively, it would not be considered a regional security anchor against Iran, Hizbullah, Iran, and other terror proxies.\n\nSome have argued that Biden's plan has Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's tacit agreement. This seems unlikely since the U.S. plan contradicts the security and strategic principles Netanyahu has espoused for the past eight months. It also rejects those principles that a majority of Israelis support: the defeat of Hamas in Gaza, the control of Rafah crossings, and the return of all hostages as a precondition to any arrangement with Hamas.\n\nThe majority of Israelis understand that defeating Hamas as a military and political power is an unconditional requirement for returning hostages and guaranteeing Israel's survival in the Middle East made unstable by an assertive nuclearizing Iranian regime and ascendant radical Islamic jihad proxies dedicated to preventing \"The day after.\"", "source": {"uri": "jcpa.org",

Biden stripped away the Israeli reply and just presented the Hamas offer. (It was the same stunt that Egypt had previously pulled.)\n\nThe Biden administration and the media (along with Barak Ravid, its current favorite agent of influence inside Israel) are now claiming that going into any of the details, as the Israelis are doing, is inconvenient.\n\nIsraeli officials are concerned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statements in recents days could sabotage the \"constructive ambiguity\" used by negotiators to draft a proposed Israeli hostage-ceasefire deal that could be accepted by Hamas.\n\nThis isn't coming from Israeli officials, it's coming from the Biden administration and its catspaws.\n\nAnd the negotiators are supposed to answer to Netanyahu, who heads Israel's democratically elected government, not the other way around.\n\nBinding agreements don't depend on \"constructive ambiguity\".\n\nConstructive ambiguity is buying a car that may or may not work. It's not a deal, it's a scam.\n\nHamas wants to know the deal's commitment to a ceasefire in Gaza will ultimately lead to the end of the war, but Netanyahu is publicly saying he is still committed to continuing the war until Hamas is defeated.\n\nThat's a pretty big difference.\n\nThe ambiguous language in the proposal could allow both sides to enter the first phase of the deal, which includes a release of a group of hostages and a 42-day ceasefire, while leaving for a later point the question of whether the agreement will actually lead to the end of the war.\n\nYou've got to pass the deal to find out what's in it.\n\nLet's see which side of the \"ambiguous language\" Biden came down on in his big speech.\n\nDuring the six weeks of ph- -- of phase one, Israel and Hamas would negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostol- -- to hostilities.\n\nNo ambiguity there. Here's the conclusion of Biden's speech.\n\n\"It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin.\"\n\nNot ambiguous at all.\n\nThere's an old that goes something like, \"If you're sitting at a table and you don't know who the sucker is, you're the sucker.\"\n\nIt's pretty obvious who the sucker is meant to be in this deal. Same sucker as in every peace deal with terrorists.", "source": {"uri": "frontpagemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FrontPage Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_greenfield@frontpagemag.com", "name": "Daniel Greenfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ehud Barak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Speech Synthesis", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Research", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Research", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.frontpagemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hamas-rule-world-frame.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

There is a deal that President Biden gave the details of on Friday.\n\nOmer was serving as a tank commander near the Gaza border when he was captured by Hamas\n\n'And we're really what we call on money time, where pressure must be put on all parties, the mediators among them course United States, Egypt, Qatar, possibly Turkey.\n\n'Of course, on Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement. The families learned today about few more members of kibbutz that are no longer with us and that terrible news shocked the hostage families.\n\n'It's time to bring this suffering to an end, it's time to work a deal that will bring our children our fathers our sisters our mothers back.\n\n'We urge everybody to do everything they can to press in all directions to bring to bring this to fruition. We need them back. It's urgent.'\n\nNeutra made his plea to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has rejected President Joe Biden's ceasefire deal.\n\nUnveiling the plan on Friday, President Biden said: 'I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition.'\n\nDet Mohamed Amen, Orna Neutra, Ronan Neutra, Rabbi Joel Levenson, Rabbi Marc Schneier, Sheikh Musa Drammeh, Leat Corinne Unger and Aviva Siegel attend a conference set up by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum and crisis comms guru Matthew Hiltzik\n\nThe new three-phase deal Biden is backing would see a six-week ceasefire while the two sides negotiate a permanent end to the fighting.\n\nIf the talks take longer, the ceasefire will continue for as long as it takes to strike a deal.\n\n'Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7th,' Biden said in remarks in the East Room of the White House, urging the terrorist group to 'take the deal.'\n\nThe second phase would involve Hamas handing over all remaining hostages and Israel withdrawing all forces from Gaza.\n\nBiden said the third and final stage would see 'a major reconstruction plan' for civilian areas in Gaza.\n\nFamilies of hostages have urged the Netanyahu government to accept the deal, after the Israel Defence Forces told families of four hostages in Gaza that they were 'no longer alive.'\n\nIn a statement the IDF said that they told relatives of Nadav Popplewell, 51, Yoram Metzger, 80, Amiram Cooper, 84, and Chaim Peri, 79, 'who were brutally abducted to the Gaza Strip on October 7, that they are no longer alive and that their bodies are held by the Hamas terrorist organization.'\n\nOfficials from the IDF said the decision to announce their deaths was based on intelligence and was confirmed by a Ministry of Health expert committee, in coordination with the Ministry of Religious Services and the Chief Rabbi of Israel.\n\nProtesters, including members of Omer's family, hold placards taking part in a 'United we Bring Them Home' march on June 2\n\nOmer seen with his parents and younger brother at a basketball game\n\nIt is currently unclear how the four hostages were killed, with the IDF adding that their bodies are still being held by Hamas after dying several months ago in the Khan Younis area.\n\nOmer's mother, Orna, said during a press conference on Monday that her son had grown up on Long Island before travelling to Israel on a gap year and joining the IDF.\n\n'He felt that he wanted to serve in the Israeli army and to do his share in protecting the country', she said.\n\n'On October 7, he was a first responder to the border. And his team and his 10 were attacked and his teammates were taken. Two of them were murdered on the day their bodies were taken into Gaza.\n\n'He and another team member are believed to be held by Hamas to the state. We hope that they're still alive.\n\n'We have not received any sign of life since he was taken. We feel that the world has become dominated by extreme, and we really need to hear more of the moderate voices on all sides.\n\n'The silent moderation needs to speak up a lot louder.'\n\nAuthorities across the US have seen hate crimes against both Jews and Muslims because of the ongoing conflict, with leaders in New York now joining forces in a bid to bring all hostages home - urging that peace is the only way forwards.\n\nOrna and Ronen Neutra (pictured) speak to Anderson Cooper in the wake of his capture\n\nSheikh Musa Drammeh, Chairman of the Islamic Cultural Center, told the conference that now is the time to speak out.\n\n'Hearing from the loved ones of these hostages continues to break our heart,' he said. 'We vowed to do what was necessary in making sure that all the hostages were released.\n\n'After October 7 we knew that as Muslims, Muslim New Yorkers, we must speak out. We must speak up, we must be bold and we must be public.\n\n'No one no one should be subjected to this. This is the moment we tell the truth. This is the moment we sacrifice.\n\n'This is the moment the Muslim community in New York embrace the Jewish community - and to say that no matter what happened, we will never ever abandon you.\n\n'We will never ever normalize what happened. We will never ever side with criminals. We will do everything we can to making sure that the hostages are released, and Israel will continue to thrive, and Israel will continue to be safe home for Israelis.'\n\nOmer's mom Orna seen speaking at the March for Israel on November 14 last year\n\nSheikh Drammeh went on to say that for Muslims to 'continue to challenge' Israel as a Jewish nation is 'illegal, immoral, and should never be tolerated'.\n\nHe was joined by NYPD Detective Mohamed Amen, Deputy Director of Muslim American Leadership Alliance Danyal Khan, Rabbi Menachem Creditor, Rabbi March Schneier, Rabbi Joel Levenson and Father Ryan Muldoon.\n\nThe group spoke of their support for the hostages, asking for prayers to help those who were still being held captive.\n\nHamas hostage survivor Aviva Siegel, 63, told the event how she had to 'beg for water' from people who would 'pray to Allah and then want to kill us.'\n\nHer husband Keith, 65, is currently being held captive by Hamas after his wife was freed after 51 days as a hostage.\n\n'I know what they're going through. And I know where they are. They starve us. And they didn't give us food while they ate in front of us. We had to beg them for water.\n\n'We were taken down 14 meters underneath the ground. And we thought we're going to die because we did not have any oxygen. We were just lying on the floor trying to breathe and I knew and felt that one more day. I'm going to die.'\n\nRonen, Omer's dad, praised Biden's new deal which seeks to end the current conflict\n\nShe added that two babies from her hometown were left without their parents, after the October 7 attack which killed 63 people that Siegel knew.\n\n'There was a child that was eight and the system seven hid themselves in a cupboard while the mother was in front of them dead', she said.\n\n'There was a family of five that hacked each other and was shocked people were burnt alive. And they were they were the terrorists that did that on the seventh.\n\n'I asked myself what kind of world this is. And I want to ask everybody if that's the world we deserve. I want a good life for the people of Gaza, I am going to stay a good human being.'\n\nLeat Corinne Unger spoke about her cousin Shem Tov Omer, who was kidnapped at the Nova festival on October 7.\n\nShe believes that it 'doesn't matter what faith' you belong to because 'faith is the thing that keeps us strong'.\n\n'No matter what faith you believe in, it should cross all boundaries', Leat added. 'And that's the faith that we should be fighting for.'\n\nOmer's father said that they spoke to their son before the attack and he sounded good, but a little tired. Within hours, they saw on a news app that their was something happening on the Southern portion of Israel. They immediately called him but could not get through\n\nOmer took a gap year off of college, deferring his acceptance to Binghamton University, so he could join the Israeli army and follow in the footsteps of his parents\n\nOf some 130 Israeli hostages remaining in the Gaza strip, about 85 are believed to still be alive, PBS reported.\n\nThe United Nations has warned the people of Gaza face famine. They've also seen the mass destruction of their homes, hospitals and infrastructure.\n\nIsrael's recent invasion of Gaza has cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies needed by the Palestinians.\n\nThey have also seized the entire border between Gaza and Egypt, where the humanitarian aid was coming through.\n\nIsrael argues Hamas terrorists hide among the general population, making the destruction necessary.\n\nIsrael's campaign in the nearly eight-month war has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nEarlier peace talks were stymied by a central sticking point: A demand from Hamas for guarantees that the war will end and Israeli troops will withdraw from Gaza completely in return for a release of all the hostages.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims",

The plan was first announced on Friday by US President Joe Biden who said that Hamas could no longer carry out a large-scale attack because of Israel's offensive in Gaza.On Saturday, Netanyahu accepted an invitation to speak to a joint session of Congress, calling it a \"privilege\" to present in front of \"the American people and the entire world\" the \"truth about our just war\". The prime minister's visit could present challenges, though, as the International Criminal's Court has issued a warrant for his arrest.Ryan Cristian, the founder and editor of the Last American Vagabond, joined Sputnik's The Final Countdown on Monday to discuss the tumultuous ceasefire proposal, as well as Netanyahu's potential speech to the US Congress.A senior Israeli official reportedly said on Monday that the US president's description of Israel's ceasefire proposal was \"not accurate\" and claimed that Biden had only announced a partial version of Israel's proposed plans in his speech on Friday. The official said that they did not agree to fully withdraw their troops from the Gaza Strip, and added that they would only do so once their \"objectives are met including destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities\".Both the Israeli official, and National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby have argued about where the plans for the ceasefire first originated from, with the US and Israel accusing the other of concocting the three-stage ceasefire plan.\"And so this is ridiculous. This is just admitting on the surface that they agreed, they set the plan out. That's why we saw across the board everybody from US politicians to Israeli politicians saying Hamas better take this, everything's on the table,\" he added. \"And Hamas then said we'll take it, and Israel then just said never mind. That's what happened. It's very simple.\"Sputnik's Angie Wong then asked their guest if he believes it would have been possible for the US president to have already had a conversation prior to his press conference on Friday as a possible preemptive measure for Netanyahu's visit to Congress.\"And you can see that this is about at least trying to present to the world that they care about the people,\" he added. \"And I mean even including the hostages and detainees, which both exist within Gaza right now. Some were IDF members, some were civilians that shouldn't have been taken.\"Thus far an estimated 36,439 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip and 82,627 wounded since October 7, according to the Palestinian enclave's Health Ministry. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that practically no health services remain in Rafah after the al-Helal al-Emirati hospital closed, Sputnik reported on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_manley@sputnikglobe.com", "name": "Mary Manley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sputnik 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint session of the United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_enclaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian enclaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1118759223.jpg?11187611141717460387", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2688, "textEnd": 2697}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

It encouraged Netanyahu and his war cabinet to \"withstand all pressures for the end of returning the hostages\".\n\nThe combined support of the two parties - which hold 18 of the 72 seats controlled by Netanyahu's expanded emergency government - could help offset opposition by far-right partners to a U.S.-backed proposal for winding down the Gaza war.\n\nThe deal's opponents - the Jewish Power party of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and the Religious Zionism party of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - control 13 seats and have threatened to quit the government over the deal.\n\nThey worry that the proposal would halt efforts to defeat the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Netanyahu has said Israel would not stop the war without toppling and disarming Hamas - while Hamas insists that any deal must end the Israeli offensive against it in Gaza.\n\nThough the Israeli public has rallied around the war triggered by a Hamas cross-border killing and kidnapping spree on Oct 7, support has eroded amid worry for the 120 remaining hostages, more than a third of whom are believed to have died.\n\nAccording to a poll aired by public broadcaster Kan on Sunday, 40% of Israelis support the ceasefire proposal, which was unveiled by U.S. President Joe Biden last week, while 27% are opposed and 33% undecided.\n\nForty percent of respondents said they believe that if Israel enters the deal that would spell an end to the war, while 34% predicted a resumption of fighting and 26% were undecided.\n\nAsked if Israel would succeed in toppling Hamas, 32% said yes, 42% said no and 26% were undecided, Kan found.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Here's today's news:\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR\n\nPalestinian officials have applied to join South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. The request, published yesterday, alleges that Israel's ongoing military offensive is \"part of a systematic effort to wipe Palestinian society and its culture and social institutions from the map.\" The request was made on behalf of the \"State of Palestine\" and signed by Ammar Hijazi, a Palestinian Authority foreign ministry official. Mike Corder reports for AP News.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces told the families of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza that \"they are no longer alive.\" The circumstances of their deaths in Hamas captivity are still under examination, according to the military, but the IDF's chief spokesperson said, \"We assess that the four of them were killed while together in the area of Khan Younis during an operation there against Hamas.\" Lauren Izso and Larry Register report for CNN.\n\nIsraeli officials are concerned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's public insistence he will continue the war until Hamas is defeated could sabotage the \"constructive ambiguity\" used in Israel's latest ceasefire plan. The plan's ambiguous language could allow both sides to enter the first phase of the deal, which includes some hostage releases and a 42-day ceasefire, while leaving for later the question of whether the agreement will lead to the end of the war. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.\n\nHamas is slated to send a delegation to Cairo today to discuss the Israeli ceasefire plan, two officials told The Times of Israel.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR -- U.S. RESPONSE\n\nPresident Biden's description of Israel's latest ceasefire proposal was \"not accurate,\" a senior Israeli official told NBC News. The official disputed that Israel had agreed to the full withdrawal of its forces from Gaza as part of a hostage release deal, and said that while the White House described the plan as originating from Israel, it was actually a proposal put forward by mediators which Israel had amended. Raf Sanchez, Yuliya Talmazan, and Monica Alba report for NBC News.\n\nBiden spoke with Qatar's Emir yesterday and urged him to secure Hamas's acceptance of the latest Israeli ceasefire proposal. Biden \"confirmed Israel's readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to Hamas\" and \"urged [Emir] Tamim to use all appropriate measures to secure Hamas' acceptance of the deal,\" according to a White House readout of the call.\n\nThe United States yesterday urged the U.N. Security Council to support the ceasefire plan advanced by Biden. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 14 other council members to back the proposal, and called on the Security Council to implement the deal \"without delay and without further conditions.\" Edith M. Lederer reports for AP News.\n\nHouse Republicans yesterday advanced legislation to punish the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor recommended war crimes charges against Israeli leaders. The House Rules Committee voted 9-3 yesterday, along partisan lines, to send legislation to the floor that would impose sanctions on ICC officials. The full House is set to pass the bill later this week and send it to the Senate, where it is expected to be ignored by Democratic leaders. Mychael Schnell and Mike Lillis report for The Hill.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR -- REGIONAL RESPONSE\n\nThe foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and Egypt released a statement yesterday affirming support for Israel's latest ceasefire plan advanced by Biden.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS WAR -- INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE\n\nThe leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) also released a joint statement yesterday endorsing Israel's latest ceasefire plan advanced by Biden.\n\nSlovenia's conservative opposition filed a motion that delays the country's recognition of a Palestinian state, a parliamentary spokesperson said. Slovenian lawmakers were scheduled to vote today on whether to recognize a Palestinian state, but the motion to hold an advisory referendum on the decree effectively delays the vote by about 30 days. The Guardian reports.\n\nIRAN-BACKED MILITANTS\n\nIsraeli airstrikes near Aleppo, Syria yesterday killed a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, Iranian state media reported. Gen. Saeed Abyar, a member of Iran's Quds Force, is believed to be the first Iranian to be killed by Israel since the two countries nearly went to war in April after Israel bombed an Iranian consulate building in Damascus. Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times.\n\nIran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets and exploding drones from Lebanon into northern Israel yesterday, according to Hezbollah, Israeli officials, and local media. Israel's military said six reservists had been injured, and a Hezbollah-controlled TV network said the group had fired at Israeli soldiers close to the border. The New York Times reports.\n\nRUSSIA-UKRAINE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe White House confirmed President Biden will not attend the upcoming Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland. Instead, Vice President Kamala Harris and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will represent the United States during the two-day event. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the decision \"would only be met with applause by Putin.\" Veronika Melkozerova reports for POLITICO.\n\nUkrainian forces yesterday claimed they had successfully hit a Russian missile system using Western-supplied weapons inside Russian territory. It is unclear if the weapons used in the strike were specifically U.S.-supplied. The Kremlin warned yesterday that Washington could face \"fatal consequences\" if it does not heed Moscow's caution against Ukraine using U.S. weapons to strike Russia. AnneClaire Stapleton and Christian Edwards report for CNN; Pierre Emmanuel Ngendakumana reports for POLITICO.\n\nGLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nPreliminary results in India's general election show the ruling BJP-led alliance is leading in just under 300 seats, while opposition parties are ahead in about 200. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is eyeing a rare third term for himself and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party. A party or alliance needs to secure 272 seats in the 543 member parliament to form a government. BBC News reports.\n\nSouth Korea announced yesterday it will nullify a 2018 rapprochement deal with North Korea to punish Pyongyang for launching trash balloons, even after the North said it would halt its campaign. South Korea's presidential national security council said a proposal on the suspension will be introduced at the Cabinet Council today for approval. Hyung-Jin Kim reports for AP News.\n\nSome Canadian MPs are \"witting or semi-witting\" participants in foreign meddling, a Canadian government report alleges. The report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians cites incidents including \"knowingly or through willful blindness\" accepting funds or benefits from foreign governments, with China and India being the \"most active perpetrators.\" Sam Cabral reports for BBC News.\n\nFormer Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan was acquitted yesterday of leaking state secrets by the Islamabad High Court. Khan, 71, is expected to remain in prison due to his conviction in another case relating to his marriage to his third wife. Lucy Clarke-Billings reports for BBC News; Asif Shahzad and Ariba Shahid report for Reuters.\n\nThe Australian army will allow recruits from foreign countries to help grow its ranks. From July, New Zealand nationals who are permanent residents of Australia can apply to join, and from next year, foreign recruits including those from the Britain, United States, and Canada will be able to join. Tiffanie Turnbull reports for BBC News.\n\nGerman authorities said yesterday they uncovered evidence of an Islamic extremist motive in last week's knife attack in which a police officer was killed. ABC News reports.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Cambodia today for a visit amid increasing concern about Beijing's growing presence at a key Cambodian naval base. Reuters reports.\n\nPoland has arrested 18 people over the past six months on allegations of pursuing hostile activities or planning sabotage as an agent of Russia or Belarus, the interior minister said yesterday. AP News reports.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Congo said yesterday that Congolese authorities have not provided details about or access to U.S. citizens who were arrested following a coup attempt last month. Jessica Donati reports for AP News.\n\nDOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\nBiden is expected to sign an executive order today allowing him to temporarily close the U.S.-Mexico border when crossings surge, a move that would suspend longtime protections for asylum seekers. Hamed Aleaziz and Zolan Kanno-Youngs report for the New York Times; Michelle Hackman and Tarini Parti report for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSen. Bob Menendez, who is on trial on federal bribery charges, yesterday filed to run for reelection as an independent in New Jersey. Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.\n\nA former U.S. soldier accused of going on an \"international crime spree\" appeared in his first court hearing in Florida yesterday after being extradited from Ukraine. Craig Lang, 34, faces charges in three states for allegedly killing and robbing a couple in 2018, conspiracy to commit passport fraud, and aggravated identity theft, among other crimes. Andrew Jeong reports for the Washington Post.\n\nA juror was dismissed yesterday after reporting that someone dropped a bag of $120,000 in cash at her home with a promise of more if she acquitted seven people charged with stealing over $40 million from a program meant to feed children during the pandemic. These seven are the first of 70 defendants expected to face trial in a conspiracy that cost taxpayers $250 million in one of the nation's largest pandemic-related fraud cases.

You may follow him at Twitter @FidelRahmati\n\nThe United States of America on Monday asked the United Nations Security Council to support a three-step plan announced by President Joe Biden aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. Ambassador, stated that she had sent a draft resolution to 14 other council members to decide on the proposal to end the hostilities in Gaza.\n\nIn a statement released on Monday, June 3, she wrote that many leaders and governments, including countries in the region, have endorsed this plan, and \"we want the Security Council to join them and call for the prompt and unconditional implementation of this agreement.\"\n\nThe Associated Press, which has seen part of this draft presented to the Security Council, reported that it requires Hamas to \"fully accept it and implement its conditions promptly and unconditionally.\"\n\nWhen Biden announced this declaration, he referred to it as Israel's proposal, which includes a \"sustainable ceasefire\" and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza if Hamas releases all the hostages it holds.\n\nIn his latest speech unveiling this plan, Biden said that the first phase of the proposed agreement would continue for six weeks and include a \"complete ceasefire,\" the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza, and the release of some hostages, including women, elderly, and the injured, in exchange for the freedom of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that the draft ceasefire in Gaza requires at least 9 positive votes in the UN Security Council for approval and is conditional on none of the other four permanent members of the Security Council, especially China and Russia, vetoing it.\n\nThe UN Security Council has yet to comment on this matter, and it is expected that voting and discussion on this draft will take place behind closed doors in the coming days.", "source": {"uri": "khaama.com", "dataType": "news",

Alongside other hostage families, she cautioned against Netanyahu's potential obstruction of a proposed deal, following revelations from US President Joe Biden regarding an Israeli proposal, as reported by The Times of Israel.\n\n\"[Biden] spoke because he knows that Netanyahu may torpedo this deal as well,\" she said. \"Biden wanted the public to know what was really on the table.\"\n\nProtests at Democracy Square, the intersection of Begin Road and Kaplan Street, have become a fixture since the inception of the anti-judicial overhaul movement last January. However, they experienced a temporary hiatus after the Hamas terror attack on October 7, which resulted in significant casualties and abductions.\n\nIn Jerusalem, thousands marched towards the President's Residence, initially planned as an anti-government rally but redirected towards securing a hostage deal following Biden's intervention. Chants reverberated through the city streets, demanding the safe return of hostages and expressing gratitude towards Biden for his efforts to end the conflict.\n\n\"He who abandons must return [the hostages],\" protesters chanted, while many held signs thanking Biden for his statement urging an end to the war.

In its first phase, the scheme envisions an immediate \"full and complete ceasefire\" lasting for six weeks, with the second stipulating the release of both Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and withdrawal of IDF personnel from the enclave. The final stage envisions \"a major reconstruction\" of Gaza with the participation of the international community in a way that would \"not allow Hamas to rearm.\"\n\nRead more: Google to Manufacture Pixel Smartphones and Drones in India\n\nOver the weekend, Ophir Falk, chief foreign policy advisor to Netanyahu, said Israel had accepted the framework.

Despite what President Biden said, it has not yet been agreed how many hostages will be released in the first phase. We can stop the fighting for 42 days in order to return the hostages.

We will not give up on an absolute victory,\" Netanyahu stressed.\n\nThe prime minister's remarks contrasted sharply with the US portrayal of Israel's stance on the plan.\n\nOn Sunday, the US State Department said Secretary Antony Blinken held talks on the proposal with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. During the phonecall, the US diplomat commended Israel's purported \"readiness to conclude a deal\" and underscored \"that the proposal would advance Israel's long-term security interests, including by enabling the possibility of further integration in the region.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalvillagespace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Village Space"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rt@globalvillagespace.com", "name": "RT", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.globalvillagespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-01-22T102640Z_1550806445_RC2LVY96YD6Y_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-POLITICS-1-jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

This deal offers a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and ending the crisis,\" the statement says.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_HaNassi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beit HaNassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/02-06-2024/1200-675-21614952-68-21614952-1717289769252.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 355, "textEnd": 364, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Already on Saturday evening, upon receiving the report on Biden's statement, Minister Smotrich threatened together with Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir said they would withdraw from the government.\n\nIt should be noted that without his two national religious coalition partners, Netanyahu would be left with only the Haredim at his side, while the rest of his coalition is populated with his sworn enemies. Benny Gantz from within the coalition and Yair Lapid from the opposition will support a vote to accept President Biden's brokered deal, and their next move would be to force national elections which Netanyahu's Likud party is certain to lose.\n\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said, \"The deal, the details of which have been published, means renouncing the elimination of Hamas, renouncing the continuation of the war - it's a promiscuous deal! There is no total victory here, but a total defeat before Hamas. I say that if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to lead this deal - we will dismantle the government.\"\n\nSmotrich declared last Saturday night, \"I have now spoken with the Prime Minister and made it clear to him that I will not be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the abductees.\"\n\nSmotrich explained: \"We will not agree to ending the war before the destruction of Hamas, nor to inflicting serious damage on the achievements of the war so far through the withdrawal of the IDF and the return of Gazans to the northern Gaza Strip, nor to the wholesale release of terrorists who will return, God forbid, to murdering Jews.\"\n\n\"We demand the continuation of the fighting until the destruction of Hamas and the return of all the hostages, the creation of a completely different security reality in Gaza and Lebanon, the return of all residents to their homes in the north and south, and a massive investment in the accelerated development of these parts of the country,\" Smotrich said.\n\nAs the details of the latest Biden administration-brokered hostage exchange agreement with Hamas emerge, Smotrich's stern objections were well founded:\n\nIn other words, over a period of 126 days, every last gain of Operation Iron Swords will be erased, and Hamas will be given the means to retake the entire Gaza Strip to prepare for the next attack on Israel.\n\nMinister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli (Likud), criticized Biden's offer at a conference in New York City on Sunday, saying, \"We have no other choice, we must continue the war and subdue Hamas. We must return the hostages, it is our moral duty as a Jewish nation, but we must also look to the future of our children. Certain conditions cannot be accepted - the end of the war when Hamas functions as a military and political organization is unacceptable.\"\n\n\"This is not a deal, this is a joke,\" Chikli added. \"Nazi Germany, and Japan, surrendered on their knees, and so should Hamas. We must eliminate Sinwar in Gaza as well as the leaders of Hamas in the Jacuzzi in Doha (Qatar).\"", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_israel@jewishpress.com", "name": "David Israel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Religious Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bezalel Smotrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haredi Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yair_Lapid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yair Lapid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Gantz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benny Gantz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Likud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amichai_Chikli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amichai Chikli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Diaspora_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Diaspora Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Religious-Zionism-Chairman-Bezalel-Smotrich-with-Otzma-Yehudit-Chairman-Itamar-Ben-Gvir-in-the-Knesset-plenum..jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Although the Jerusalem branch of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum distanced itself from the event, several hostage relatives took charge of the procession.\n\nMeanwhile, a joint statement from Qatar, the United States, and Egypt urged Israel and Hamas to embrace the proposed ceasefire and hostage release deal outlined by Biden. \"Qatar, the United States and Egypt jointly call on both Hamas and Israel to finalise the agreement embodying the principles outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"These principles brought the demands of all parties together in a deal that serves multiple interests and will bring immediate relief to both the long-suffering people of Gaza as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families. \"This deal offers a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and ending the crisis,\" the statement adds, The Times of Israel reported.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaplan Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_HaNassi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beit HaNassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/jun/Netanyahu-ka_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 82, "textEnd": 91, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Washington's strategic purpose is to remind the belligerents - Hamas and its allies and Israel and its allies - that the war is not the end of the road, especially if a definitive victory continues to elude both sides while the human and material losses mount, and their international standing and domestic circumstances worsen and grow even more complicated than they are already. Factoring the future into military equations helps diplomacy and political action become more effective as it forces the belligerents to consider opportunities they could seize or risks they could avoid.\n\nAs the situation stands at present, there are several competing visions for the \"day after.\" The Israeli vision is premised on inflicting an overwhelming defeat on Hamas enabling Israel to assert complete control over Gaza. The \"day after\" opens with Israeli-controlled buffer zones followed by the installation of administrative structures and staffs, whose salaries would be footed by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), to govern education, health and security affairs. In so doing, Israel would effectively renege on its obligations under the Oslo Accords. In the process, it would also be creating more settlements.\n\nHamas, too, envisions a victory, one claimed on the basis that Israel failed to achieve its stated objective of eliminating Hamas. It will drive this home by showing that it can still fire missiles into Israel and continue to rule Gaza while preventing a return of the PLO to the Strip. Towards this end it would conclude a deal to hand over the hostages in exchange for the withdrawal of Israeli forces and agree to a two-state solution without recognising Israel.\n\nThe Arab vision was articulated by nine countries, the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries plus Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco, all of which have peace treaties or normalisation agreements with Israel. It calls for a total ceasefire and a hostage/prisoner swap between Hamas and Israel. The process would start with a temporary truce to set into motion the hostage/prisoner exchanges, which would take place over several stages, with larger numbers of hostages and prisoners exchanged in each successive stage to promote the durability of the ceasefire. Also, in accord with this vision, the PNA would be reinvigorated and equipped to administer both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nThe US endorses the broad outlines of the Arab vision for the establishment of peace and security in the Middle East through arrangements between the Palestinians, Arabs and Israel. Washington hopes to promote three deals. The first is \"normalisation for peace\" whereby a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement would reward Israel with normal relations with Riyadh in exchange for a credible path towards the establishment of a Palestinian state. The second would set into motion the comprehensive reconstruction of Gaza by Arab states and international agencies in exchange for the rehabilitation of a unified PNA over the West Bank and Gaza. The third deal would function at the bilateral level and provide that, in exchange for normalisation with Israel, Saudi Arabia would be guaranteed security under a formal arrangement, approved by Congress and along the lines of the security agreements the US concludes with its other allies.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the many political and diplomatic actions, media pressures, efforts on the part of UN organisations (the Security Council, the General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, and the International Criminal Court), the fifth Gaza war is about to enter its ninth month with no sign of abating.\n\nJudging from previous US efforts, Washington is currently focused on deescalating the war by pressuring Israel to make its current drive in Rafah its last. US experts now believe that Israel will not be able to eliminate Hamas but that it has managed to degrade the Palestinian movement's military capacities, which success will be crowned by destroying Hamas' four remaining battalions in Rafah. Simultaneously, Washington is pushing for resumption of the Egyptian and Qatari mediated truce negotiations based on what has been achieved so far in the hope of opening a horizon to relative calm in the coming weeks. Regarding the bilateral security relationship with Riyadh, the two sides are aiming for a formula that is not as strong as the US' defence commitment to Japan but stronger than its defence commitment to Taiwan. Finally, once peace is established, the US will work together with the Arab states to support the PNA economically, in security affairs, and in reconstruction.\n\nSeveral factors could jeopardise progress in the foregoing areas. One is time: as the US presidential elections approach, both Israel and Hamas are playing the \"Trump card\" in order to perpetuate their current positions and undermine Biden's steps. Secondly, as none of these steps would allow a continued political role for Hamas, Hamas, with Iranian support, will do what it can to thwart them. Thirdly, many obstacles could obstruct efforts to promote a unified Palestinian stance with the necessary speed.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title":

House.\n\nThe announcement has also exposed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had approved the proposal, to potential backlash from his far-right coalition partners, who have threatened to collapse the government over the deal.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby emphasized that the move was not intended to undermine Netanyahu or the Israeli war cabinet.\n\n\"This wasn't about jamming the prime minister or the war cabinet,\" Kirby stated. \"This was about laying bare for the public to see how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal -- how it shows how much they really want to get this done.\"\n\nKirby added that the disclosure was aimed at applying public pressure on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and the militant group, who have repeatedly rejected Israel's proposals. \"If anything, this was about putting some public pressure on Mr. Sinwar and Hamas, who have repeatedly refused to accept what Israel has put forward,\" he explained.\n\nDespite Netanyahu's reported comments about \"gaps\" between the Israeli proposal and the deal outlined by Biden, the White House maintains that it is unaware of any discrepancies.\n\nKirby noted that Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser confirmed to The Times of London that the offer detailed by Biden was indeed an Israeli proposal.\n\n\"We're confident that [Biden's speech] accurately reflects that [Israeli] proposal -- a proposal that we worked with the Israelis on, so I know of no gaps to speak of,\" Kirby asserted during a briefing with reporters.",

At no point did she mention the Palestinians killed and displaced.\n\nIf the military doesn't rule over Gaza, \"everything will come back again and again\", 38-year-old Yechezkal Garmiza, a reserve soldier in the Givati Brigade told the Post.\n\n\"We need to finish the job,\" he said - a reflection of the broad, if carefully curated, consensus that holds across Israeli media.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, the urgency of the protests calling for the return of the captives is growing.\n\nThis week, tens of thousands of people pressed into Democracy Square and other locations around the country to demand the release of the captives and the dismissal of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHowever, calls for the captives' return and criticism of the government is not the same as a demand to halt the war. Public support for the conflict is strong, if starkly divided along political lines, polling carried out by the Pew Research Center from March to April has shown.\n\nThe roots behind much of that division was recently highlighted in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which spotlighted in two stories the strict controls imposed by the Israeli censor over what information Israeli citizens are, and are not, allowed access to.\n\nAny information deemed \"sensitive\", including everything from the reasons behind the continued detention of Palestinians caught up in Israeli police dragnets to the campaign of intimidation against a former prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC), are withheld by law from the Israeli public.\n\nIn recent weeks, a request by the current prosecutor of the ICC for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, have been dismissed by most Israeli politicians and media as \"new anti-Semitism\", according to Parnes.\n\nLikewise, the decisions by Ireland, Norway and Spain to recognise Palestine can be dismissed as a rejection of Israel rather than its actions.\n\nAside from official protestations that Israel is being singled out, it has not swayed public opinion notably in favour of the war.\n\n\"If you asked me what the mood was two weeks ago before all these things happened, my answer would be the same: Support for the war might be slacking ... not on humanitarian grounds but for direct, personal reasons,\" Parnes said.\n\nMore recent initiatives, such as a peace plan announced by United States President Joe Biden after Parnes was interviewed - framed as an Israeli proposal - have also served to divide and undermine public enthusiasm for a war that appears to many to have no end.\n\nIsrael launched its war on Gaza on October 7 after a Hamas-led incursion into its territory killed 1,139 people and took more than 200 captive.\n\nSince then, Israeli attacks on the small strip of land have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, wounded more than 81,000 and destroyed any sense of normalcy among a battered and traumatised population.\n\n\"The government of Israel is leading its country to commit crimes of magnitudes that are difficult to [comprehend] and even continues to abandon its hostages,\" Parnes said.\n\nLast week, Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi told Kan public radio he was expecting seven more months of war if Israel were to destroy Hamas and the smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza.\n\n\"Most Israelis want to see the hostages back and do not support endless military operations in Gaza,\" Eyal Lurie-Pardes of the Middle East Institute told Al Jazeera last week.\n\nWithin Israel, seemingly irreconcilable views over the fate of the captives and the future of Gaza divide politicians as much as they do the public, pushing an end to the fighting beyond reach.\n\nThe gulf between those two sides broadened further on Friday when Biden made his announcement of the peace proposal he claimed came from Israel.\n\nRather than unify, the proposal has divided.\n\nFar-right cabinet members Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have threatened to rebel over any suggestion of halting the fighting.\n\nNetanyahu rival and supposed centrist Benny Gantz has spoken warmly of the deal and previously threatened to quit the three-man war cabinet, on which he sits with Netanyahu and Gallant, if no plan for Gaza beyond the conflict is agreed.\n\n\"In mid-May, Gantz threatened to quit the cabinet by June 8 if no plan is forthcoming,\" Lurie-Pardes said. \"However, that date is approaching, and we're still waiting.\"\n\nWhile the current peace proposal may be grounds for postponing that threat, any plan on Gaza's future is unlikely to satisfy either Gantz and his supporters or the Smotrich-Ben-Gvir camp, who are open in their ambitions to colonise the enclave.\n\nIn the short term, opposition leader Yair Lapid has promised to support Netanyahu in parliament on the peace plan, but it is not open-ended support for the prime minister as Lapid has also signalled an intent to form an alternative government.\n\nLast week, Lapid met with politicians Avigdor Lieberman and Gideon Sa'ar to plan a rival government, one they urged Gantz to join.\n\nAll this manoeuvring and division will have little to no impact for those dying in Gaza, the International Crisis Group's Mairav Zonszein said.\n\n\"There's no political will to halt the fighting. Lieberman and Sa'ar are both extreme right-wingers. They're unlikely to halt the war.\n\n\"Gantz is unlikely to offer a real alternative to the current approach aside from operating in a way that is more acceptable to the US,\" she said.\n\n\"Public confidence in Israel's war aims may be lessening, but people are still struggling to see an alternative to the fighting,\"\n\n\"At first sight, Israel's war aims - to destroy Hamas both as a military and governmental force and to return the hostages - were straightforward,\" Lurie-Pardes said.\n\nHowever, he continued, those aims are not likely to happen without a political solution for a Gaza administration, and Netanyahu cannot offer that without risking his coalition, which relies on the far right.\n\nNetanyahu is also suspected by many analysts of extending the war for his own personal ends, namely to stay in office as he is on trial on corruption charges.\n\n\"All Netanyahu needs to do,\" Lurie-Pardes said, \"is to maintain his coalition for the next two months of the Knesset summer session. If he manages to do so, we're not really looking at elections before March 2025 because of the different requirements of election laws in Israel.\"\n\nFor those trapped in Gaza, March is a long way away, if they survive.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_speakman_cordall@aljazeera.com", "name": "Simon Speakman

Thanks for joining us for the NSC News of the Day Gaggle with John Kirby.\n\nI'd like everyone to pause for a moment and join us in wishing John Kirby a very special happy birthday, which he is hating me for announcing to you all right now.\n\nMR. KIRBY: You're a dead man, Sean. (Laughs.)\n\nMODERATOR: With that important announcement, I'll turn it over to Kirby.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Good morning, everybody. As I think you saw, today we announced that Vice President Harris and the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, will travel to Lucerne, Switzerland, on the 15th of this month to participate in the Summit on Peace in Ukraine.\n\nAt that conference, they will underscore the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to supporting Ukraine's effort to secure a just and lasting peace based on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the principles of the U.N. Charter.\n\nAt the summit, the Vice President and Mr. Sullivan will highlight the importance of countries around the world continuing to support Ukraine's effort to secure a just and lasting peace.\n\nAnd I think as you all know, this war could end tomorrow if Mr. Putin would simply withdraw his forces from Ukraine. In the meantime, we will continue, and our allies and partners will continue, to support the people of Ukraine as they fight every day to defend themselves against this aggression.\n\nNow, if I could switch to Mexico. We congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum on her historic election as the first woman president of Mexico. President Biden and the team look forward to working closely with President-Elect Sheinbaum and her team.\n\nAs noted in the President's statement that we released this morning, we're committed to advancing the values and interests of both our nations to the benefit of our peoples.\n\nWe also congratulate the Mexican people, of course, for conducting a nationwide successful democratic electoral process involving races for more than 20,000 different positions at the local, state, and federal level. It's quite an achievement, and we congratulate them on that.\n\nWith that, we can take some questions.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our first question we'll go to the line of Will Weissert with the Associated Press.\n\nQ Hi there. Happy Birthday again. Thanks so much for doing this.\n\nWhy did the President make no mention in Friday's remarks about -- that Israel remains determined to destroy Hamas? Why does the administration think that Hamas would be willing to agree with that huge Israeli caveat? And what other gaps, as Netanyahu referred to them, are there between the U.S. and Israel?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The President has spoken numerous times about the right and responsibility of the Israelis to eliminate the threat that Hamas poses right across their border. Nothing has changed about that. The purpose of the speech was to lay out the details of this recent proposal for a hostage release, a ceasefire, and a potentially -- a potential end to hostilities for the long term. And that was the reason he wanted to lay that out for the American people.\n\nBut make no mistake -- I mean, he remains consistently supportive of Israel's right and responsibility to go after the threat posed by Hamas.\n\nI didn't write down all your questions, but I think you asked about -- oh, why we think Hamas would go for this.\n\nI think -- I would point you to comments that Hamas leaders themselves made on Friday, which was that they were -- that they received the President's speech in a positive way. And now they've got this proposal; they got it Thursday night. We're awaiting an official response by them. And they ought to take the deal. This gives them what they've been looking for, which is a ceasefire and, over time, through the phases, the potential withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nSo they ought to take this deal. It's very forward-leaning. And it's good for the people of Gaza, good for the Israeli people. And they just need to move forward on it.\n\nAs for the gaps, I don't know what gaps you're referring to. I mean, I've heard different statements coming out of Israel. The Israeli Foreign Minister himself acknowledged that this was the Israeli proposal, that it was accurately -- that it is the Israeli proposal. And we're confident that it accurately reflects that proposal, a proposal that we worked with the Israelis on. So I know of no gaps to speak of.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question we'll go to Steve Holland with Reuters.\n\nQ John -- and Happy Birthday, John. How did it come about that the President announced an Israeli -- a ceasefire plan? And did the Israelis know he was going to do it?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Can you repeat that again?\n\nQ How did it come about that the President announced an Israeli ceasefire plan? And did the Israelis know he was going to do it?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, we informed them that the President was going to speak on the hostage deal before he did, of course.\n\nAnd to your first question, it's important to remember this was -- it is an Israeli proposal. It's one that we and they worked on through some intense diplomacy. It's the result of our own diplomatic efforts with Israel. But it is, in fact, their proposal that they have, again, publicly acknowledged is, in fact, their proposal.\n\nThe President felt that it was important to lay it out there publicly. As you know, Steve, we don't typically go through the details of these kinds of proposals. But in this case, given where we are, given how much longer the hostages have now been held, given the fact that Hamas has reneged on several past occasions on proposals that were sent to them, and given the fact that the Israelis really did work hard to come up with this proposal and did so in good faith, the President felt it was important, for the first time, to publicly lay that out.\n\nThe timing was related based on the fact that, the night before, we had given it to Hamas. So that's what explains a Friday speech, is that Thursday it went to Hamas.\n\nBut he thought it was important to lay out the details publicly so that the whole world can see what was in here and the whole world could see how seriously Israel was taking this, and to make it clear that Hamas absolutely needs to accept this proposal. It's a good one. It gets us six weeks of peace. It gets us the hostages out. It gets us the ability to negotiate for phase two, which would get all the hostages out and a potential cessation of hostilities.\n\nThis, as the President said in his speech, is the best way to end this conflict.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question we'll go with Nick Schifrin from PBS.\n\nQ Hey, John. Happy Birthday. Just going to be (inaudible) --\n\nMR. KIRBY: I'm going to kill Sean Savett. (Laughter.)\n\nQ Quick fact-check elucidation. You've said twice now Hamas received the proposal Thursday night. Can you just confirm that was -- it's a proposal in writing that they got?\n\nAnd two major questions. Have you received any Israeli assurance that an agreement agreed to by the war cabinet would be authorized by the full cabinet?\n\nAnd a senior administration official on Friday night told us it was, quote, \"minor differences\" between this draft and what Hamas had put forward. Don't suppose you can detail what those minor differences are? Thanks.\n\nMR. KIRBY: No, I really can't. I don't want to go into any more detail than the President did. And quite frankly, I hope you would agree the President actually laid out a lot of detail in terms of the phases and what each phase would produce.\n\nBut for those minor differences, I think it's best if I don't go there.\n\nI'll let the Israelis speak to their internal domestic politics. This is an Israeli proposal. The Foreign Minister himself acknowledged that. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that. This is their proposal. I'll let them speak to internally how they arrived at it. But as I told Steve, it was certainly the result of a lot of diplomacy between them and our team over recent weeks.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question we'll go with MJ Lee from CNN.\n\nQ Hi, John. Happy Birthday. And thanks for spending a part of your birthday with us.\n\nFirst of all, just on the ceasefire deal, can you quickly confirm whether it is correct that the ball is in Hamas's court right now?\n\nMR. KIRBY: First of all, there's no other place I'd rather be on my birthday than with all of you.\n\nAnd secondly, yes, it is fair to say that the ball is in Hamas's court.\n\nQ Okay. And I was hoping you could help us make sense of the Prime Minister's response to the President's speech on Friday. So, the Prime Minister said that there can be no permanent ceasefire until the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, among other things. The President said in his speech last week that Hamas has been degraded to such a point that it couldn't again perpetrate another October 7th-like attack. So are they not seeing eye to eye on this?\n\nMR. KIRBY: I think I'm going to let the Prime Minister characterize his public comments. What I can tell you is that we've had a lot of diplomatic conversations with the Israelis in recent weeks, during which or after which we arrived -- they arrived at this proposal, their proposal, again, as a result of a lot of diplomacy between us. We're comfortable that it represents fairly and honestly an Israeli proposal, a very forward-leaning Israeli proposal. And we're confident that Hamas needs to take it.\n\nI want to make -- put a punctuation point on this one point, because it came up in the first question. There is no question at all that we don't want to see Hamas pose a threat to the Israeli people. We absolutely agree with the Prime Minister that Hamas and their ability to conduct that kind of an attack again must be prevented, and that Israel has a right and a responsibility to go after that threat and prevent another October 7.\n\nThe President said clearly on Friday that, from a military perspective, we don't assess that Hamas can conduct another October 7. We didn't say -- he didn't say that that doesn't mean that Israel can't continue to go after the threat as appropriate. As a matter of fact, as you and I are speaking, they are still operating in Rafah and trying to put pressure on those leaders and some of those military units there. And we understand that.\n\nBut now's the time, as they have militarily degraded Hamas to the point where they can't right now conduct another October 7th -- now, as they continue to put pressure on these leaders and these units in Rafah, now is the time to move forward to the next stage here, get phase one of this in place, get at least some of the hostages out, get a six-week ceasefire, get 600 trucks in a day so that we can get to phase two and a permanent cessation of hostilities.\n\nAgain, I won't speak for the Prime Minister's comments and why he said what he said. All I can tell you is this proposal is an Israeli proposal. It is the result of intense diplomacy between our two teams. The President characterized it accurately. And now it's up to Hamas to accept it.\n\nQ And just quickly, you said the Israelis did get a heads up that the President would be making his speech on Friday. Did they object?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Not that I'm aware of.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question we'll go with Michelle Jamrisko of Bloomberg. Michelle, you should be able to unmute yourself.\n\nQ Sorry about that. Good morning, Admiral. And let me add my birthday greetings with apologies.\n\nI wanted to get your reaction to OPEC+ members agreeing to extend to next year their output cuts. How are you seeing that from a national security perspective? And how much pressure do you see that putting on prices at the pump for Americans?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, I would just say that the President remains focused on those prices at the pump for consumers, and they continue to come down. I'm not going to be able to comment on what OPEC does from month to month. Again, our focus is going to be on the price at the pump for consumers. And the President is confident that he's got the strategies in place to do that. But I won't be able to comment much more beyond that.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question we'll go with Andrea Mitchell from NBC.\n\nQ So, could you clarify: The Prime Minister said that he's never agreed to withdraw from Gaza. The President never said there was a complete withdrawal from Gaza. He said it would be a withdrawal from populated parts of Gaza. Is that an important distinction? Because does that leave Israel with control of those buffer zones that they have now created contrary, actually, to what the U.S. wanted?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, I think that's getting a little ahead of where we are right now. You're right, the proposal calls for a phased withdrawal from populated centers. I think there's some flexibility in there given the tactical situation in Gaza and what that might look like.\n\nBut if we're able to get to phase one and then phase two, an Israeli withdrawal from population centers is certainly not an insignificant move on their part or for the Palestinian people of Gaza.\n\nBut that's just further afield of where we are right now. What we need right now is for Hamas to accept this proposal.\n\nQ And let me ask you a couple of other things just very quickly. Clearly, it does not address the number of Palestinian prisoners or their identities, which are always a huge obstacle. I mean, that's -- understandably, you're not in that kind of detail yet, but that's something that would be a hurdle. But it also does not address a pathway to a day after or a Palestinian state or Palestinian governance, which was always part of Secretary Blinken's, you know, initial proposals that he got acceptance from, from all of the Arab states, in a trip to eight different Arab countries several months ago.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yes, Andrea, you're right. So, first of all, on the ratio of prisoners and hostages -- to hostages, I mean, that is actually baked into this first-phase proposal. We didn't offer that level of detail. As I said, the President walked through in great detail but not every detail. And those details are hammered out in that proposal that Hamas has. I'm just not at liberty to go beyond the detail -- the level of detail the President displayed for everybody.\n\nOn your second question: You're right, but I would ask you to remember what this is and what it isn't. This proposal the President talked about is, in fact, an extension of the hostage negotiations that we've been engaged in for weeks. It is primarily designed to do three things: get hostages out -- again, in a phased approach; get more humanitarian aid in -- again, in a phased approach, hopefully up to 600 trucks a day; and then get a ceasefire in place.\n\nIn the first phase, it will be a temporary ceasefire, six weeks in duration, to allow the teams and the negotiators to negotiate what phase two looks like. And we don't know what phase two could look like. All we know is what the President -- as the President said on Friday, phase two would entail all the remaining hostages, including male soldiers, getting out -- point one; and point two, a set of circumstances that would lead to a cessation of hostilities, comma, permanently. That's what phase two would end in.\n\nAnd that's really what this was about. That was the bounds of it, the left and right side of it that the President talked about. It doesn't talk about a two-state solution or what the day-after governance could look like because that's not what it's about. It's really about getting the hostages home.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that we aren't still working hard on day-after governance or that we've given up on the idea of a two-state solution. I think as you saw a week or two ago, I can't remember now, but press coverage about how close we were to an agreement, a bilateral agreement with the Saudis, a significant bilateral agreement between our two countries that could help set the conditions for bringing Israel in and moving forward on this normalization deal.\n\nSo, yes, those things weren't discussed in the speech. Yes, they are not in this, but that's because they are not in the proposal that went to Hamas. But again, it does not mean, just because it's not in that proposal, that we're not still working those objectives.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. Next up we'll go to Danny Kemp with AFP.\n\nQ Great. Thank you. Thanks, Admiral. And Happy Birthday. A couple of things, if I may, very briefly.\n\nThe first is just on Ukraine and Vice President Harris attending this conference. Doesn't it look a bit bad for the President to be skipping this peace summit for Ukraine and going to a glitzy Hollywood event instead?\n\nAnd secondly, anything you can tell us on any executive orders on migration that might be announced tomorrow? Thanks.\n\nMR. KIRBY: On your second question: No, I'm not going to go there.\n\nOn your first question: What looks bad is when we have a supplemental request sitting on Capitol Hill for six months and the House Republicans refuse to move on it, to supply the arms and ammunition that Ukraine needs while they're getting attacked in the Donbas, and then the Russians decide to start attacking Kharkiv. That's what looks bad.\n\nThere hasn't been any single leader around the world who has supported Ukraine more, and more stridently, than Joe Biden. And as I said last week, no matter who represents the United States -- and oh, by the way, the Vice President is representing the United States of America at this summit -- it can't be said that the United States has in any way walked away from supporting Ukraine.\n\nIn fact, this whole peace formulation that President Zelenskyy formulated over a year ago and has been trying to operationalize, he's been able to do that, able to have these conversations, able to bring other countries to the table because the United States has been so supportive of this peace formula that he has come up with.\n\nAnd we're looking forward to having the discussion in Lucerne, both the Vice President and Jake Sullivan, to see what the United States can continue to do to support it.\n\nBut you just -- I've been talking about this war since it began, back when I was at the Pentagon. There is no way that you can look at what Ukraine has been able to do over the last two-plus years and not see the hand of the United States there every single step of the way.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question we'll go with David Sanger from the New York Times.\n\nQ You don't look a day older than this, but if you stay\n\nin this job, you might. (Laughter.)\n\nMR. KIRBY: I feel a lot older than the birth certificate would say.\n\nQ Yeah, me too.\n\nSo two questions for you. One: On Israel, your usual routine would be to say, \"We're not going to make announcements for the Israeli government; it's up to the Israelis.\" How many times have you said this to us? But in this particular incident, the President made a decision to jam the Prime Minister by announcing this for him and then making him try to prevaricate back and forth about whether or not this was really an Israeli proposal, on which he was a lot less clear than, say, as you pointed out, your foreign minister. Was that the intent?\n\nAnd then I got a quick question on Ukraine.\n\nMR. KIRBY: No, that was not the intent. This wasn't about jamming the Prime Minister or the war cabinet. This was about laying bare, for the public to see, how well and how faithfully and how assertively the Israelis came up with a new proposal, how it shows how much they really want to get this done.\n\nReally, if anything, this was about putting some public pressure on Mr. Sinwar and Hamas, who has repeatedly refused to accept what Israel has put forward. They simply have not proven willing to take yes for an answer. And every time, the Israelis come back with yes.\n\nQ So why not just let the Israelis announce it and then have the President come out and endorse it and say the ball is in Sinwar's court? That's not how you did it.\n\nMR. KIRBY: That's not how we did it. And as I said, the President felt that where we are in this war, where we are in the negotiations to get the hostages out, that it was time for a different approach and a time to make the proposal public, to try to energize the process here, catalyze a different outcome. The President believed that this was the right approach to do it.\n\nAnd as I said, the timing was really related to when it was delivered to Hamas, which was the night before.\n\nQ Okay. And on Ukraine: The President obviously, on Thursday, made this decision to allow American arms to be shot into a very limited area of Russia. President Zelenskyy over the weekend thanked him for this and then immediately said: It's not enough. We're going to need to have this right throughout much of the rest of Russia; we're going to need to have it perhaps in other areas.\n\nAnd we actually heard Secretary Blinken, on the last day of his trip last week, say this may not be the last area that gets approved. Can you help us think through this moment?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, I won't get ahead of decisions that haven't been made. As you well know, every step of this war -- as the war has evolved, the battlefield conditions have changed, we have evolved and we have changed our support to Ukraine. And that's -- I wouldn't expect that that general approach is going to be any different in coming weeks and months. We'll see where things go and what the Ukrainians need.\n\nI mean, look, who can blame President Zelenskyy for wanting more stuff and more ability to use that stuff as his country continues to come under attack and as they particularly face a concerted -- a still-concerted effort by Russia to endanger Kharkiv, one of their most important cities in the north?\n\nSo, I mean, I don't think it should come as a shock to anybody that President Zelenskyy would be grateful on one hand, but also eager to continue to press his case going forward.\n\nAnd so we'll have those talks, we'll have those conversations with the Ukrainians. Absolutely, we will. And whether it leads to any additional policy changes, I can't say at this point, but we're not going to turn our back on what Ukraine needs. And we're going to continue to try to, again, evolve our support to them as the battlefield evolves as well.\n\nI would just reiterate that the guidance that we just issued late last week that you're referring to with respect to cross-border counter-fires is specifically focused on Ukraine's defense against military targets that are just over the border and targets that Russia is using to physically launch offensives against Ukraine proper. It just makes common sense.\n\nAnd our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS, for instance, or long-range strikes, inside of Russia has not changed.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question we'll go with Karen DeYoung from the Washington Post.\n\nQ You mentioned that Israel is still operating in Rafah and this deal doesn't mean that they can't continue to go after the threat as appropriate. If Hamas said today or tomorrow, or whenever, \"Fine, we accept,\" does Israel immediately stop its operations in Rafah and remove its forces from that populated area? Is it simultaneous with the release of hostages? What happens first? And who takes over governance in populated areas in Gaza?\n\nMR. KIRBY: So, as the President laid out on Friday, if Hamas accepts and we can begin phase one, it would, in fact, mean the first batch of hostages are released, again, over a period of time, of course. And over a corresponding period of time, Israel would withdraw its forces from populated centers. It would also mean, as the President said, the end or the cessation of Israeli military operations in Rafah proper. As for how many troops would move back and over what timeframe, I think that all would have to be ironed out.\n\nAnd how simultaneous it is, you know, with the release of hostages, I don't have that level of detail. It's not like a shotgun start here that I know of, but it is all part of phase one.\n\nAnd your second question was on governance in Rafah? Is\n\nMR. KIRBY: That's what we're trying to get at here. That's why -- to Andrea's question, that's why Secretary Blinken is still working hard. And the President talked about the day after. We've got to get to the day after, and we are having conversations --\n\nQ I'm not talking about the day after. I'm talking about phase one. Who takes over in these places when the Israelis withdraw, both in the north and central Gaza and in Rafah?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, I think you heard over the -- I mean, certainly this is a question really more for the Israelis to speak to, but Defense Minister Gallant made comments in just the last day or so about setting up civilian governance centers in Gaza that would be run by Palestinians who are not affiliated with Hamas. But I'd let them characterize that view a little bit more closely.\n\nQ But the Israelis have proposed this before, and the Palestinians have said the Israelis don't get to choose. And people -- the Palestinians rejected that, rejected Israel establishing this, and said, \"You don't have anything to do with it.\" So who decides?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Again, this is the conversation we're having with the Israelis, will continue to have with them. They've proffered some ideas on what that could look like as they would potentially withdraw from Gaza. I'd let them speak to that.\n\nQ And just to (inaudible) now -- so you would expect that if Hamas said today, \"Fine, we accept the deal,\" Israel would immediately begin withdrawing its troops from Rafah (inaudible)?\n\nMR. KIRBY: What I said was there would be corresponding discussions about the tick-tock and exactly when the hostages would be released, when the prisoners would be released, and then when Israeli forces would begin to move out of population centers. But as our understanding, in phase one, as soon as phase one begins, that operations in Rafah would end. That is our understanding.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. We just have time for a couple more. We'll go to Ron Kampeas with JTA.\n\nQ Oh, thank you for taking my question. First of all, it seems that the crux of the disagreement as to -- between the Israelis and you guys on this thing has to do with President Biden saying the proposal says if the negotiations take longer than six weeks for phase one, the ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations continue. That seems to suggest that basically, you know, the temporary ceasefire is going to be a permanent ceasefire, and the Israelis aren't able to do anything about it. And so, it'd be interesting to understand how exactly you do understand the transition between phase one and phase two.\n\nAnd the broader question is that: On October the 10th, the President said \"pure, unadulterated evil\" has unleashed on this world. And I think what the Israelis want to know is: How can you leave pure, unadulterated evil in place as a part of this deal? Hamas gets to continue to exist, you know, maybe perhaps not in a capacity in which it can carry out an October the 7th, but it's still there. And I think that -- I'd just like you to address that.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Look, I don't think I can say it any better than the President said, to your first question. During the six weeks of phase one, Israel and Hamas will negotiate the arrangements to get to phase two, which would be -- which would represent a cessation of hostilities, a permanent cessation of hostilities.\n\nBut there's an awful lot of work that has to be done to negotiate what phase two looks like. And as the President also said, you know, those negotiations would have to proceed in good faith between Israel and Hamas. And Israel will want to, as they have a right to in these negotiations, make sure that their interests are protected, of course.\n\nAnd that gets to your second question. We don't ever want to see another October 7th. We don't ever want to see, going forward, Gaza under the control of Hamas, whatever post-conflict Gaza governance looks like.\n\nAnd, yes, I understand we don't have all that figured out right now. We don't have all the answers to all that right now. We're working on it very, very hard. Whatever it looks like, it can't look like it did on the 6th of October, when Mr. Sinwar had the ability, singlehandedly, to violate a ceasefire that was in place and send his fighters into Israel to slaughter 1,200 people. That can't happen again.\n\nNow, what that looks like going forward, I can't tell you right now. But if the essence of your question -- and if I don't get it right, you tell me -- but if the essence of the question is, you know, should we expect that Israel should have to live next door to that kind of a terrorist threat, the answer is no, of course not.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. We have time for just one more question. We'll go to Haley Bull with Scripps.\n\nQ Hey. Thank you. And Happy Birthday, John. I wanted to go back to some of Netanyahu's statements since the President's announcement. Is there any concern that him so publicly speaking about their insistence of reaching their war objectives is undermining the pressure you're trying to put on Hamas?\n\nAnd then, on Ukraine: I know you just outlined all the reasons why the President is such a strong supporter of Ukraine. Given that, why not send him to this peace summit then? Thanks.\n\nMR. KIRBY: On your first question, the short answer is no. It is true that our assessment is that Hamas is militarily not capable of conducting the attacks of October 7th again. It is true that the Israelis have put an enormous amount of pressure on Hamas and have degraded their capabilities in a very significant way, or their military capabilities.\n\nBut even as you and I are speaking here, they are still conducting targeted operations inside Rafah because there are still viable threats by Hamas inside Rafah. There are still tunnel networks where they continue to harbor fighters, potentially hold hostages, and certainly store weapons. And they still have a capability down there, and Israel has every right to go after them. They are, and they're doing it in keeping with the plans that they shared with us, and they're doing it with capabilities that we continue to provide them to use.\n\nSo I simply refuse to accept the premise of the question that the President's comments with respect to military capabilities of Hamas somehow undermines Israel's ability to go after them when, in fact, they continue to go after them as you and I are speaking.\n\nAnd, look, as for the -- your second question: As I said before, Ukraine has no stronger champion than President Biden. And the United States has actively participated in every single one of the previous Ukraine peace summits. Every single one. And as I said earlier, we have been the strongest, most staunch supporter of this peace deal that President Zelenskyy put forward.\n\nSince he put it forward, the United States has been trying to find ways to operationalize it. We're sending the Vice President of the United States and the National Security Advisor to this particular peace summit -- again, because of our desire to be represented around that table.\n\nBut as I said last week -- and, by the way, that alone is high level, very serious representation by the United States.\n\nBut as I said last week, no matter who it would have been representing the United States, there can be no question that Ukraine has no stronger backer than the United States. And we've proven that time and time and time again over the last two and a half years.\n\nI don't think you can name another nation that has done as much for Ukraine and for their ability to push back on Russia than the United States. And I don't think you can name another leader around the world -- in fact, I know you can't name another leader around the world who has done more than President Biden has to back up President Zelenskyy in every single way possible. I mean, my goodness, we were just talking, to David's question, about the cross-border policy and how that might change. And my answer is that, you know, we're going to continue these conversations; we're going to continue to help them do what they have to do.\n\nYou can't name me another foreign leader that's doing as much as Joe Biden.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you so much. And thank you all for joining us for our gaggle today. I hope everyone has a good rest of the day, and feel free to send us an email if we didn't get to your questions.", "source": {"uri": "whitehouse.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "The White House"},

Biden, aimed at promoting a lasting ceasefire in Gaza; the access of humanitarian aid; the protection of civilians; the return of displaced people; as well as the reconstruction of destroyed areas.\n\nThe Kingdom \"hopes that the various parties concerned will adhere to this initiative and commit to implementing its different stages,\" the ministry underlined in the statement.\n\n\"Morocco continues to believe that a lasting peace in the Middle East inevitably depends on a two-State solution: a Palestinian State, on the borders of June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side with an Israeli State,\" the statement added.\n\nThe roadmap to an enduring ceasefire was detailed by President Biden in remarks he made end of last week at the White House. He pointed out that the new proposal provides for a full and complete ceasefire; a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza; a release of a number of (Israeli) hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAlso, Palestinians would return to their homes and neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, including in the north, and humanitarian assistance would surge with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day, President Biden said, explaining that with a ceasefire, that aid could be safely and effectively distributed to all who need it. Besides, hundreds of thousands of temporary shelters, including housing units, would be delivered by the international community.\n\nA major reconstruction plan for Gaza constitutes another phase of the roadmap. In this connection, President biden said that under the deal, a rebuilding of Gaza will begin [with] Arab nations and the international community, along with Palestinian and Israeli leaders...\"And the United States will work with our partners to rebuild homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza to help repair communities that were destroyed in the chaos of war,\" the US President said.", "source": {"uri": "northafricapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Africa Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Quds Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Welcome back to those of you who were traveling us last - with us last week. Start with some opening comments.\n\nSince the President's remarks on Friday, Secretary Blinken has been engaging in intense diplomacy with foreign counterparts to urge the completion of an agreement for a ceasefire in Gaza that would secure the release of hostages and set the stage for lasting peace. Over that time, the Secretary has spoken to the foreign ministers of T\u00fcrkiye, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Israeli Defense Minister Gallant and war cabinet member Benny Gantz.\n\nIn all of his calls, the Secretary has underscored the benefits of this proposal to both Israelis and Palestinians. For Palestinians, a ceasefire would see an end to the daily death toll in Gaza, an end to the destruction that has torn so many families apart, and robbed children, women, men of their lives and their futures. It would allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to begin returning to their neighborhoods as the international community surges humanitarian assistance into Gaza and launches a major reconstruction effort.\n\nFor Israelis too, this proposal offers a path to a better future. It would bring home the hostages who have now been separated from their loved ones for 240 days. It would unlock the possibility of calm along Israel's border with Lebanon, where we saw continued terrorist attacks by Hizballah just today, so the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes for the past eight months could finally return home. And it would set the conditions to finally realize the strategic realignment which Israel has long sought - improved relations with its Arab neighbors and the isolation of Iran and the terrorist groups it funds.\n\nThis is the possibility that exists for Israelis and Palestinians today. As the United States said in a joint statement on Saturday with Egypt and Qatar, this proposal will bring immediate relief to both the long-suffering people of Gaza and the long-suffering hostages and their families. It offers a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the crisis.\n\nThe world should know - the Palestinian people should know - that the only thing standing in the way of an immediate ceasefire today is Hamas. The proposal on the table is nearly identical to what Hamas said it would accept just a few weeks ago, and it is now time for them to act. It is time for them to accept the deal. It is time to finalize this agreement and put an end to the suffering of Israelis and Palestinians alike.\n\nAnd with that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: All right. Thank you. And welcome back. Just logistically, all of these calls that - all of - well, if you did say calls, I guess they were all on the phone.\n\nMR MILLER: He saw Fidan on Thursday. He then talked to - he talked to Fidan and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Jordan on the plane on the way back. On Friday, he talked to the foreign ministers - the prime minister of Qatar and the foreign minister of Egypt and - foreign ministers of Egypt and UAE on Saturday, and then he talked to Benny Gantz and Yoav Gallant last night.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So where do things stand? I mean, I think you tried to make it very clear right now that everything rests with Hamas. But there seems to be a lot of friction, to say the least, inside the Israeli Government about this. Are you confident that the Israelis have, in fact, signed off and are willing to go along with this?\n\nMR MILLER: We are completely confident. It was an Israeli proposal. Obviously it was a proposal that they developed in consultation with the United States and Qatar and Egypt, the three countries that have played the mediating role throughout this process. But this was ultimately an Israeli proposal.\n\nIn terms of where it stands, it was submitted to Hamas on Thursday night. We have yet to hear a response. We obviously saw the statement that they put out - I think it was on Friday - but we haven't gotten a response back from them.\n\nIn terms of the - inside the Israeli Government, the President spoke to this in his remarks on Friday, where he said that - fully anticipated that this would be controversial with some members of the Israeli Government, and of course we've seen some members of the Israeli Government already come out and oppose it, in fact opposed it over the weekend.\n\nBut the case that he made and that we will continue to make is that this is a proposal that is in the long-term security interests of Israel. It's obviously in the long-term interests of the Palestinian people as well, but this is a chance to not just come to an end in the - to the conflict in Gaza and return the hostages home to their families, but help solve the conflict in the north of Israel, which is displacing tens of thousands of Israelis, and finally bring further integration with the region, which is in Israel's long-term security interests.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. And then - but then on the other side, where you make the case how it's great for Israel, what does Hamas get out of it? And I'm not asking because I think or that they should necessarily get something out of it.\n\nMR MILLER: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: But it's a negotiation, and there's always give-and-take and concessions. So how - what's one of the selling points for Hamas do you think?\n\nMR MILLER: So let me talk about the - what the Palestinian people get out of it. I know that's not the exact question that you asked, but I --\n\nQUESTION: No, it's not. Because it's actually - I think it's a different question.\n\nMR MILLER: So the Palestinian - because they ought to be the same. They ought to be the same answer, and it - but it might not be, you're right. The Palestinian people get an end to the conflict in Gaza, an immediate ceasefire. They get a surge of humanitarian assistance, 600 trucks a day. We are ready with international partners to begin the reconstruction of Gaza. Credible - that they get to return to their homes and their neighborhoods, and those who have lost their homes get the ability to start to rebuild those homes.\n\nNow, as it pertains to Hamas, look, if Sinwar decides that he's safe in a tunnel and this proposal isn't in his interest because he feels safe, that's an assessment he can make. But I think it is very clearly in the interests of the Palestinian people, and we would hope that, given that this proposal is nearly identical to the one that Hamas submitted just several weeks ago, that they would not move the goalposts now and try to walk away from it.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But - well - but - all right, I'll let that be. The last one --\n\nMR MILLER: No, I get where you're going, but look, I mean, I can't answer for Hamas, but - hold on.\n\nQUESTION: I mean - I know, but - well, you can't answer --\n\nMR MILLER: I would just say Hamas claims they represent the Palestinian people. This is manifestly in their interest, so - and given the fact that Hamas just a few weeks ago signed off on a virtually identically proposal, they should accept it.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, but you just spoke to the points of why this would be wonderful for Israel, and that there is - the way you've approached this so far is that - the way a lot of people have approached it is that Hamas doesn't care about the Palestinian people, they only care about themselves. And so there are, in a sense, three parties to this: Israel, the Palestinian people - non-Hamas - and Hamas. So - but I think the answer to my question, which is \"what's in it for Hamas?\" is essentially nothing for them.\n\nMR MILLER: So they claim to represent - I'm not trying to be cute - they claim to represent the interests of the Palestinian people.\n\nQUESTION: I get it. They claim to. But you don't believe that, and you've made it clear many, many times that you don't think that they do care about the Palestinian people and they don't --\n\nMR MILLER: Well, I suppose this proposal puts - I suppose that this proposal puts that question very squarely to Hamas.\n\nQUESTION: But didn't the last one and the one before that and the one before that?\n\nMR MILLER: And given that this one is nearly identical to the one that Hamas presented --\n\nQUESTION: And then my last one - I want to focus on this \"nearly identical\" - what does that mean? Because a lot of small changes - I've seen negotiations break down over the placement of punctuation marks.\n\nMR MILLER: And that I can't get into in detail from here at the podium, but I will say if you look at the major elements of this proposal, they are nearly identical to the major elements of the proposal that Hamas submitted several weeks ago. There are some minor differences. They are differences that we think that can be bridged, and it's not just the United States that thinks they can be bridged. They are differences that the other mediators, Egypt and Qatar, think that can be - that think can be bridged. I think actually - it's - this is a serious enough proposal that Hamas should just accept it, but if we - there need to be further negotiations, we think those are all eminently bridgeable if - and this is the if - if Hamas wants a deal.\n\nQUESTION: And if - are there nearly identical - does that apply to the - what the Israelis submitted? Or is this word for word what the Israelis submitted?\n\nMR MILLER: The proposal that went to Hamas? Yeah, it is what the Israelis submitted. Their --\n\nQUESTION: So in other words, they - so in other words, the \"nearly identical\" does not apply to the Israeli --\n\nMR MILLER: That is a comparison between the Israeli proposal, which is what went to Hamas on Thursday, and the proposal that Hamas submitted several weeks ago.\n\nQUESTION: All right. Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Maybe just following up on that - said that this is basically what Israel has proposed or accepted. Of course, there is criticism within Israel as well; it's not a monolithic country. I mean, are you sure that Israel can follow through on this, that if Hamas says yes, that - considering the coalition politics and the politics within Netanyahu's cabinet that Israel would definitely go ahead with this?\n\nMR MILLER: So I certainly can't speak to internal Israeli politics - complicated enough for Israelis to speak to without the United States trying to weigh into them. I would say two things. Number one, this is a proposal from the Israeli Government, so that's the first thing that's important. But number two, I think it is important to speak to the benefits of this proposal to all Israelis, and that's why you saw the President do it on Friday. It's why you've seen the Secretary speak to some of these same themes and issues a number of times, including in Israel.\n\nAnd I will say the point that the President made in his remarks on Friday, that you've seen the Secretary say a few times, is that endless conflict in Gaza in pursuit of some idea of total victory is not going to make Israel safer. We agree with Israel that Hamas cannot run Gaza. We agree with Israel on Israel's right and Israel's obligation to pursue Hamas for the terrorist attacks of October 7th. But an endless conflict without a political plan forward is just going to leave Israel bogged down in Gaza and is going to exacerbate the security challenges that they face in the north of Israel. It's going to exacerbate the security challenges they face in the West Bank. It's going to exacerbate the security challenges they face against Iran and the proxies that it funds, because it makes it more difficult for Israel to work with its allies and its partners in the neighborhood.\n\nSo in addition to the long-term security interests that we think this proposal would help address, in addition to bringing the hostages home, which is obviously in the national interest of Israel, it addresses the very real short, medium security challenges that they face. And that's why we think it's in their interest and that's the case that we will continue to make. But the President was pretty clear about this, that we recognize there are people in Israel - including in the Israeli Government - that oppose it. And we're going to continue to make that case and we expect that the Government of Israel will too.\n\nQUESTION: Could I just follow up on two things with that? The - first of all, in the proposal itself, I mean, the - sorry, in the President's remarks, he said that Hamas basically can't do another October 7th attack. In terms of what's the assessment for that, what's the basis for that, is there anything else that needs to be done to ensure that outcome? Basically, would - under this, would Hamas need to more formally lay down some arms? Is there some sort of settlement that would be involved to make sure that that's the case?\n\nMR MILLER: So let me separate two parts of that question, because I think they're slightly different. One is just a question of capability, and Hamas clearly does not have the capabilities it had on October 7th when it launched that horrific terrorist attack. It has seen its leadership degraded - not all, but significantly degraded. It has seen a great deal of its personnel killed or captured. It has seen a great deal of its military materiel destroyed, and not just the weapons themselves, but the underground factories that they were using to produce more weapons, that they used on October 7th; those have been in many cases destroyed by Israel.\n\nSo it is in many ways an incredibly diminished organization from the one that it was on October 7th, and we do not believe could conduct an attack anything like the scale and scope that it did on October 7th. Now, it still poses a threat, absolutely. Hamas launched rockets against Israel just last week, and Israel needs to continue to have the ability to defend itself against that threat. But this goes to the point that we ultimately think you cannot address this threat with just a military solution. This is what I was getting to the other day when I said this idea of pursuing a total victory, which the President spoke to, that just a military campaign in itself, while it will without a doubt continue to kill and capture members of Hamas, is also going to serve as a recruitment device for other potential Hamas members that will come and join and replenish the ranks. And so you have to have not just a military campaign, but a political path forward as well.\n\nAnd that is - to get around to the second part, or what I deemed is the second part of your question - what the Secretary and other members of the administration have been working on with other partners in the region since - intensively since early January, and that is a political path that provides for the reconstruction of Gaza, a political path forward, the security of Gaza. And so when you look at this proposal, obviously the first phrase is for the immediate release of some hostages and a ceasefire; and then over - during phase one you would negotiate phase two, and in phase two and in phase three we would pursue what we've termed the day after. And it's how you ultimately come up with a different governing authority for the West - for Gaza that is not Hamas.\n\nAnd I'll just make clear, in case there is any question, when the Secretary gave a speech in November in Tokyo, he made quite clear that one of the principles that we see for the end of this conflict is that Hamas cannot continue to govern Gaza - period, full stop.\n\nQUESTION: There actually just one thing that's slightly - but just in the proposal, just the language: \"major population centers,\" that the Israelis will withdraw from them. Is there actually a list of what the major population centers are, or is there some wiggle room? Could this be something that could become a point of contention in the future?\n\nMR MILLER: So it just means what it means, which is major population centers. And partly that is because the population of Gaza has been fluid, or where the population of Gaza is has been fluid over the past months because you've seen people move from one place to another. So it means major areas in Gaza where you have people gathered together. And so that's the point of it. I don't want to get into it any more from here, but I think the term is fairly obvious.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. I just wanted to follow specifically on this assessment of Hamas's military capability because some of Israeli officials seems to have taken objection to that line in the President's speech about what they are capable of doing. John Kirby has since said that this stems from U.S. intelligence and military assessments as to what they're capable of. Are those assessments something that the Israelis share in terms of what Hamas is capable of? And then secondly, is that the same bar for the Israelis? Because it seems to be that that's at the crux of whether they're willing to agree to a permanent ceasefire or not.\n\nMR MILLER: So I'm not going to speak to what the Israeli military or intelligence assessment might be. I - as I just said, our assessment is that Hamas in no way could conduct a terrorist attack the size, the scale, the scope of what it launched on October 7th. It has been diminished as a terrorist organization. But that, again, does not mean that the threat has disappeared. It has not. Hamas continues to fight Israeli soldiers in Gaza; it continues to launch rocket attacks in Gaza. And those need to be dealt with.\n\nIn terms of - but in terms of where the proposal - where this roadmap would go forward, there are a number of issues that would need to be negotiated as we transition from phase one to phase two, and that's what I was getting at in my comments a moment ago, that we don't think this idea of total victory where you pursue a military campaign in perpetuity with really no end in sight is something that's in the security interests of Israel. It's obviously not in the interests of the Palestinian people. And so that is the point that we'll continue to make to them.\n\nQUESTION: Without getting into specifically what the Israelis assess, is there a difference between the U.S. assessment and the Israelis' assessment?\n\nMR MILLER: Again, I can't really get in - I can't answer that question without getting to what their assessment is. I can only speak for the United States.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So speaking only for the United States, is this a recent assessment? Because presumably Hamas's capabilities would have been steadily degraded up until this point. Has something changed where they've reached a sort of benchmark, in our view?\n\nMR MILLER: I cannot give you a date where we made that assessment, but we have seen their capabilities steadily degraded over the past eight months of this campaign. Obviously, you saw it first in the north, and then in Khan Younis, and then significantly with the destruction of tunnels that housed Hamas's major weapons manufacturing programs, as IDF made those quite public when they did it. And so when you look at Hamas's capabilities, I think it - it's quite clear that while they still pose a terrorist threat, and we will back Israel's right to deal with that threat, we do not believe they can again launch an attack the size, the scale, of October 7th.\n\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. So there - so the U.S. is unilaterally assessing this. There may still be a difference as to what the Israelis think Hamas is capable of.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. Okay. And then one last one. I mean, if this, as you guys have put it, is the best possible deal that negotiators to this point have been able to present Hamas, what is the plan if they say no?\n\nMR MILLER: So I'm not going to deal with hypotheticals. As we've made quite clear, there's no reason they should say no. This is essentially the proposal that they made. Now, if they want to move the goalposts and back away from what is essentially a proposal they put forward several weeks ago, at some point Hamas ought to have to explain to the world why it has rejected this proposal. And that's what the President was making clear on Friday when - we all get why people criticize Israel. We all get why people criticize the United States for our support for Israel. But this is a proposal to actually reach an immediate ceasefire, to surge humanitarian assistance in, and ultimately set the conditions for an end to the war. Why wouldn't Hamas accept it?\n\nAnd so we have welcomed the statements that have come out in the Arab world calling on this deal to be finalized. We have welcomed the statements that we have seen from the G7 and from other leaders calling for this deal to be finalized. Only Hamas can speak to what it will do. But it ought to have - it ought to have to explain that answer if they do reject this proposal that is, as I said, manifestly in the interests of the Palestinian people.\n\nQUESTION: If they do reject it, though, you would expect the Israeli campaign to continue and for the U.S. to continue supporting Israel as it pursues that campaign?\n\nMR MILLER: I'm not going to deal with hypotheticals. But I think the Israelis have made quite clear that the campaign would continue absent a ceasefire.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, thank you. I wanted just to try and understand what the space for - we're talking about going from phase one to phase two in this deal. If you're saying - you still have the strong line that Hamas can't run Gaza in the future. But you're also saying that there is no path to total victory, to total sort of eradication of Hamas.\n\nMR MILLER: By military means alone is what I mean by that.\n\nQUESTION: By - right. So you're - so what you're asking is for Hamas to peacefully - the leaders and the members of Hamas to peacefully disarm and sort of just disappear. What is the actual sort of proposal here for someone like Yahya Sinwar, who's there, he's a leader? You're saying him and his cadre of leaders of Hamas have no role in the future of Gaza. So what are - what's - what are they - where are they going to be in the future?\n\nMR MILLER: So because that is quite clearly an issue that will still need to be negotiated - we haven't even gotten the acceptance of this proposal yet, but should it be accepted, phase two and all of these related questions are things that will have to be negotiated as part of the process - I am not going to do that negotiation here in public. That said, we have long made clear that we think Hamas should lay down its arms, and that continues to be our position.\n\nQUESTION: But you have kind of moved from earlier in the war, I think, the - you were strongly supporting Israel's goal of completely eradicating Hamas. Now there seems to be this little space for they can exist in some form in --\n\nMR MILLER: No. That is not at all what our position is. What our position is, is that you cannot eliminate Hamas just through military means, just through a military campaign. And this has been the experience of the United States in counterterrorism activities all around the world, that a military means by itself, without some kind of political path for the population, will ultimately prove ineffective.\n\nAnd you can take out terrorists and see those terrorists replaced and ultimately find yourself in the same strategic position you did at the start of the campaign. And so that's why you have to pair a military campaign, which Israel has executed, with a political plan for the people in Gaza. And that is ultimately what we are trying to pursue.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. If the President said that this was an Israeli proposal in essence, why would there be the need to implore the Israelis to accept it? Could you explain that to us?\n\nMR MILLER: We are not - we are imploring others in the Israeli Government to accept this proposal.\n\nQUESTION: Right.\n\nMR MILLER: But this is - this is - this is a proposal that was put forward by the Government of Israel.\n\nQUESTION: Right.\n\nMR MILLER: I think we were - went into this with eyes wide open that there are certain people in the Israeli cabinet, in the Israeli Government, who would probably not look too kindly on this, and of course we've seen their statements in the days since. But ultimately, this is an Israeli Government proposal. But Said, to the point, it's a proposal the Government of Israel made, and we expected that there would be intense debate about it in Israel. There has been. You saw demonstrators out on Saturday night urging that the proposal move forward. And of course you saw several members of the cabinet urging its rejection.\n\nAnd so what the President's message was is that Israel should reject those voices at the ends of the spectrum who have said, don't take a deal to bring the hostages home, don't take a deal to advance Israel's long-term security interest.\n\nQUESTION: So knowing that there is a war cabinet and then there is a larger cabinet and so on, where there is a great deal of veto power among certain people in the larger cabinet and so on - so conceivably they could turn it down. What would be your second plan in this case? Because we saw - we heard the President - allow me, if I may - we heard the President say this war must come to an end. And using the most authoritative podium on Earth, which is the White House, to say this, I mean, there seems to be some sort of commitment that this war has to end.\n\nMR MILLER: So the reason I was smiling at the question is I'm interested that the question is about what Israel might do about a proposal that they put forward that is pending with Hamas, and the real question right now is to Hamas, right.\n\nQUESTION: Right.\n\nMR MILLER: It is Hamas that has this proposal in front of them and Hamas that is the decisionmaker right now about whether it can go forward or not. Now, that said, we have been quite clear that we will continue to make - speak to the Israeli public, speak to the Israeli Government about why this deal is in their interests and why, should we get a deal, moving from phase one to phase two is in their interests and why further integration with their neighbors is in their interests. But let me be clear: The roadblock right now to a ceasefire is not Israel; the roadblock to a ceasefire is Hamas.\n\nQUESTION: Fair. Fair point. But we know that communication with Hamas, especially in Gaza, is very tenuous, is very difficult. It's not that easy. So that may take time. So it could be just an issue of time. They may agree and so on. So if they do, that's it. There is no backing down. Israel will have to sort of abide by this agreement?\n\nQUESTION: Right. One - a couple of last points - allow me - on the West Bank - I really want to ask because --\n\nMR MILLER: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: -- what we have seen is a situation that is really deteriorating in the West Bank. We see towns like Tulkarm, for instance, were being - it being almost besieged. The land was taken, they erected steel doors and so on, and all these things. And I wonder: What is your position on all this? Can - is this reversible? Is this something that you could sort of pressure the Israelis to sort of pullback from?\n\nMR MILLER: So the violence that we have seen in the West Bank is unacceptable. It must stop. Civilians are never legitimate targets of violence; they must be protected. We urge Israel to do everything its power to prevent these attacks in the first place and - when they're not prevented - to hold those responsible accountable. We urge them to work with the Palestinian Authority to that end, and we have also made clear that we are willing to take our own actions to hold people accountable. You've seen us impose visa restrictions and economic sanctions on individuals and entities who perpetrate or support violence in the West Bank, and we will not hesitate to continue to do so.\n\nQUESTION: And finally, Samantha Power - the Israeli - I mean, I'm sorry, the - Samantha Power said that Israel is the chief impediment to Gaza aid. How do you assess what she said?\n\nMR MILLER: So I won't speak to her comments. I'll let my USAID colleagues speak to them. I think if you look at her - the full substance, she was speaking to the conflict ongoing being the chief impediment to getting aid in. And that is - that is manifestly the case. You can get aid - even when you get - can get aid to Kerem Shalom, it's often difficult to get it distributed inside Gaza because people are moving to new places and there's ongoing conflict. That's been a challenge throughout that we will continue to work through.\n\nBut two things with - in that regard. Number one, so there were just officials from the U.S. Government who met in Cairo yesterday with officials from Egypt and from Israel to try and work on a solution to reopen Rafah gate. They were constructive discussions, professional, and we'll continue to pursue them in the coming days because we want to see Rafah open, because that would be another gate to allow humanitarian assistance in. And then second - back to the bigger point - if we could get a ceasefire, if Hamas would agree to this ceasefire proposal, we could get 600 trucks a day coming in - and not just coming in, but it would be much, much easier for them to move safely around Gaza and get humanitarian aid into the hands of the people that we need - who need it.\n\nNadia.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. Prime Minister Netanyahu said neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority will play a role in the day after in Gaza. Do you agree that the Palestinian Authority should be --\n\nMR MILLER: No, we do not. We have made quite clear we see a role for the Palestinian Authority in the governance of Gaza after this conflict.\n\nQUESTION: So do you see this as a point of - that might be not acceptable for Israel in terms of this proposal that the President put forward?\n\nMR MILLER: So when it comes to all of those issues about who would govern Gaza at the end of the - this conflict, I'll say two things. One, it is something that we have been, as you know well, discussing with Arab partners in the region. It's been a good subject of the work that we have done and as well as the work that we have done to encourage the Palestinian Authority to take steps to reform itself - so not just Israelis could have faith in the Palestinian Authority, but so the Palestinian people could have faith in the Palestinian Authority governing as a non-corrupt, faithful actor in the interest of the Palestinian people. So that's the first thing I would say.\n\nThe second thing is - I would say is that we are going to continue to engage with the Israeli Government about this, and there are a diversity of views inside the Israeli Government about the Palestinian Authority and the role that they ought to play and the future that they ought to play in governance in Gaza. And we're going to continue to make clear to them that we think a revitalized, reformed, fully functional Palestinian Authority is in the best interest of the Palestinian people, it's in the best interest of Israel, and it's especially in the best interest of Israel's security.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. I want to have another go at the previous questions on Hamas. The President said that Hamas capabilities had been degraded to the degree that they don't pose a threat equivalent to the October 7th. Would you entertain or accept some kind of political presence for Hamas, or do you think that is going to be a situation analogous to the de-Baathification that we have seen in Iraq after the war, which is de-Hamasization, if - I don't know if the term applies. But basically, that nobody will be allowed to take part in any kind of shape or form of civil authority, of local authority, whatever. We're not talking about a demolition brigade.\n\nMR MILLER: Yeah. So I'm not going to get into any level of detail because we're just not that - at that point in the process. But I will say at a high level, it is the strongly held view of the United States that we will continue to push that Hamas can play no role in the governance of Gaza. It has lost any legitimate claim it ever had - and we didn't think it had one to begin with, but it's lost any legitimate claim to participate in the governance of Gaza by virtue of launching a brutal massacre of 1,200 Israelis on October 7th.\n\nQUESTION: And finally, Saudis and Qataris has condemned an Israeli Knesset attempt for a bill, actually, to label UNRWA as a terrorist organization. Do you condemn this attempt by the Israeli Knesset to do that?\n\nMR MILLER: So I am not - I was not aware of that vote. Obviously we do not believe UNRWA is a terrorist organization. We - there were members of UNRWA who UNRWA provided evidence had participated in some way in the attacks of October 7th, but that is not the --\n\nQUESTION: I want --\n\nMR MILLER: No, but hold - but that is not - that is not actions by UNRWA the body itself. So that's our general position, but I can't speak to a specific vote because I'm not - I'm not familiar with the specifics.\n\nQUESTION: Sure, but I just want - but if - I want you to clarify this: UNRWA has provided evidence that some members were a part - took part in the --\n\nMR MILLER: Yeah - well, so I should say provide - they briefed us on evidence that they found. Yeah, at the beginning of this - I've gone through this a few times - at the beginning of this entire issue with regard to UNRWA, a lot of people think it was - we took the action that we took to suspend UNRWA's funding because of something the Israeli Government told us, and that's not the case. It was UNRWA that came to us and said they were aware of these allegations. They had looked into them, found evidence that certain members of UNRWA had participated in the attacks of October 7th, and so had suspended and fired 13, 14 - I don't remember the exact number now. And that's why we took the action we did.\n\nQUESTION: And you can update us on the investigation because it's been what a few months now?\n\nMR MILLER: I can't because it's not a U.S. Government investigation. It's the United Nations investigation. I would refer you to them to speak to that.\n\nQUESTION: -- a clarification on your engagement with the PA? Are you engaged with the Palestinian Authority right now?\n\nQUESTION: What are the whereabouts of Mr. Hady Amr, for instance? Is he engaged?\n\nMR MILLER: He has been - he travels back and forth between here and the region quite regularly. I don't know if he's here or in the region today. But yeah, he engages regularly with the Palestinian Authority, as do officials in our embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nQUESTION: Matt, did you hear back from the Israeli regarding the investigation on the strike in - last weekend?\n\nMR MILLER: We have not - well, number one, I don't know if the investigation has concluded. But in any event, we haven't been briefed at this point.\n\nQUESTION: And on this proposed deal, the President - also the Secretary yesterday in his call with Gantz, he mentioned that this proposed deal will unlock a calm on the northern borders. Do you have something substantial? Did you - is there a progress made here with Hizballah?\n\nMR MILLER: So we've had ongoing conversations for some time to try to reach a political solution to the cross-border strikes between Israel and Hizballah. And we have made progress in those conversations, but ultimately, it is our assessment that it's very difficult to reach a solution to that problem without calm in Gaza. Ultimately, all of these problems are interconnected, and as long as there is intense fighting in Gaza, it's very difficult to reach a solution in the north. And it - that intense fighting also poses other security challenges for Israel. And so we do believe that, should we get a ceasefire in Gaza, especially if we can make that a durable ceasefire that ends the war, that that is a challenge that we can resolve.\n\nQUESTION: Did you discuss such a deal or diplomatic resolution for the conflict between Israel and Hizballah with Hizballah and Iran?\n\nMR MILLER: So I'm not going to get into any conversations. We don't have direct communications with Hizballah, obviously. But we have been pursuing diplomatic - a diplomatic resolution to this issue for some time.\n\nQUESTION: And one more on Iran. Iran's acting foreign minister said today that the process of negotiations between U.S. and Iran are currently underway, and exchange of messages and consultations continue. Can you confirm that?\n\nMR MILLER: I cannot. I will just say that we have always made clear we have the ability to get messages to Iran when it is in our interest to do so, but I'm not going to confirm or readout any specific conversations.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Just question on the framework that's currently on the table.\n\nMR MILLER: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Can you say if it's the U.S. expectation that during phase two and three of the deal, if it's implemented, if Israel would still be able to carry out specific targeted military strikes should a threat emanate from within Gaza?\n\nMR MILLER: So I don't want to speak to - I don't want to speak to that in terms of tying it to phase two and phase three, because those are things that are going to have to be negotiated in the exact - the exact parameters of that negotiation. We're not - we don't even have a deal for phase one yet, so I should refrain from commenting on that. But the President made clear we will always back Israel's right to defend itself, and that remains true.\n\nAll right. Go ahead, Janne.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. I have two questions. I want to follow up again on the last North Korean garbage balloon question. Last time China sent spy balloons to the United States, but North Korea's send over thousands garbage balloons to South Korea over the past few days. These garbage balloons contain all kinds of unsanitary germs. There could also be damage to U.S. troops in - stationed in South Korea. What measures do you think the U.S. and South Korea to take in this regard?\n\nMR MILLER: So I will just say that it's obviously quite a disgusting tactic - irresponsible, childish - and it should come to an end. And I'll leave it at that.\n\nMR MILLER: Any country that sends trash to its - floats trash over in a balloon to its neighbors. (Laughter.)\n\nMR MILLER: (Laughter.) If it is an agreement between two countries, that is a very different thing. (Laughter.)\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. Do you think that the - yeah, one more. Do you think that this is a violation of the UN Security Council?\n\nMR MILLER: I would have to consult with people here whether trash-carrying balloons - I'm not trying to be flippant. I just have to consult with some people here about whether that's the case.\n\nQUESTION: Also, do you think this action has anything to do with China - China involvement --\n\nQUESTION: Is the Secretary intending to accompany the Vice President in Switzerland at the summit?\n\nMR MILLER: I don't have any scheduling announcements to make with that peace summit. I - you heard the Secretary say a number of times over the past few weeks, you heard us say that we would be well represented at that summit, and that's - clearly saw that today with the announcement that the Vice President would be attending.\n\nQUESTION: Right. President Zelenskyy called out China for sabotaging that event. Do you share his concerns?\n\nMR MILLER: So I will just say that when it comes to the peace summit - I'm going to speak for the United States - that we support the peace summit. We want it to be successful, and that's why you see the Vice President of the United States attending that summit. We support Ukraine's diplomatic efforts. That said, we have always been clear that China could play a useful diplomatic role in helping resolve this conflict if it wanted to. But that said, right now it's hard to see how they could play that role given the actions that we've seen China take over recent months to rebuild, reconstitute Russia's defense industrial base. So we are going to continue to make clear to China that we object to those actions, that we will hold entities responsible for those actions, and we've heard our Russian - sorry, our European counterparts say the same thing.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Let's head to Georgia, if I may, where the Kremlin-inspired draft already became law of the land. The speaker who signed it today was quoted as saying that the Western foundations - I'm quoting him - are financing organizations that are financing terror, violence, et cetera. There are other officials who are talking about clearly shutting down the civil society organizations - clear departure from what they told us intention - their original intention was. Moving forward, how do you expect them to apply the law?\n\nMR MILLER: So I'm not going to speak to that. I will say we have been quite concerned about exactly the point you raise, which is that this law moves Georgia away from its democratic trajectory and could stigmatize civil society and stifle the freedoms of association and expression, and that the actions fundamentally alter the U.S. relationship with Georgia. And so that's why we have launched a review of our relationship and will consider our response to the actions that the Government of Georgia has taken.\n\nQUESTION: More on that point, the mayor of Tbilisi is quoted as saying that we have, quote/unquote, done nothing to be sanctioned. Is he mistaken?\n\nMR MILLER: We've announced a new sanctions policy. We have not yet announced individual sanctions. And I'll leave it at that.\n\nQUESTION: But --\n\nMR MILLER: We - but we have made clear that we would not hesitate to impose them.\n\nQUESTION: Fair enough. Given what's at stake here, why did the Secretary make no mention of Georgia during his Eastern European trip?\n\nMR MILLER: The Secretary just put out a statement announcing an entire comprehensive review of our policy with respect to Georgia that could jeopardize hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance that we provide to Georgia, and as well announced a new visa restriction policy that you should fully expect to see the United States take action on. I think I'll leave it at that. His commitment to this issue has been quite clear.\n\nQUESTION: Sorry. Getting back slightly to the Middle East but staying in Europe.\n\nMR MILLER: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: I don't know how many times you get asked about Slovenia. The - so the parliament is debating recognition of a Palestinian state, of the state of Palestine. It's been put on hold by the opposition. I know in the previous three cases of European countries, the reaction - you had a reaction coming out. But as it's actually in process, does the U.S. want to tip the scales one way or another? Do you have a position on whether Slovenia should go ahead and recognize a Palestinian state?\n\nMR MILLER: So look, ultimately, we see those steps as not helpful or productive at this time. We have been quite clear that we support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state - the Secretary has been working on actual paths to get us there through diplomacy in the region - but that ultimately that is a step that needs to come not through unilateral recognition but through direct negotiations between the two parties.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just ask you briefly about two elections? I know you issued statements on them already, but two major countries: Mexico and South Africa. I know that there have been statements issued in both, but particularly the case of South Africa, it seems the ANC for the first time since the end of Apartheid is going to lose a majority. The U.S. has a relationship with South Africa, but obviously there have been some ups and downs recently with regard to Russia, with regard to - with regard to the issues in The Hague. Does the United States anticipate any changes to the relationship with South Africa coming out of this, anything more to the U.S.'s liking potentially?\n\nMR MILLER: So I'd say that we remain committed to deepening our cooperation with South Africa. We cooperate with South Africa on a number of - a number of areas, even places where we have differences. There are other areas - such as expanding economic prosperity, fighting the climate crisis, ensuring that democracy delivers - where we work quite closely with South Africa, and we would fully expect to do that with the new government.\n\nAnd I do also want to take a note to congratulate the South African people on successful national and political elections, and this won't - maybe won't have resonance for everyone in the room, for the younger crowd in the room, but for some of us older folks, this is now three decades of South Africans having the opportunity to exercise the fundamental right to vote. Something that seemed difficult and far beyond reach when I was a kid has been achieved and now has - we have seen entrenched for three decades, and it's I think important to highlight that positive development.\n\nQUESTION: And on Mexico, again, I know there was a statement issued, but with AMLO there are quite a few arrangements on migration that have taken place. Is it the understanding that these will continue on with the new administration? Do you think - do you anticipate any type of shakeup in terms of the migration protocols with --\n\nMR MILLER: So I think we'll let the new president, the president-elect, take office before we start talking about specific policies. But we do expect to continue our close working relationship with the Government of Mexico. We value the special relationship we have with them and remain committed to working together to advance our mutual economic and security interests.\n\nRyan.\n\nQUESTION: So back in February the White House announced sanctions on people undermining peace, security, and stability in the West Bank. I'm not sure if you saw, but Senator Chris Van Hollen just suggested that those sanctions ought to apply to Smotrich, who you mentioned earlier today as an obstacle to the peace deal. Is that something that the State Department would consider?\n\nMR MILLER: So I'm never - I make this a rule never to make sanctions announcements or talk about what we're considering before we impose any sanction, and before anyone reads anything into that comment, you shouldn't read that one way or the other. It's just our blanket rule in not talking about possible sanctions.\n\nQUESTION: Quick Pakistan question. I'm not sure if you saw Imran Khan was acquitted of his previous conviction on the cipher case, so the only case that he's currently jailed for is what's known as this un-Islamic marriage charge. So the most popular politician in Pakistan is currently in jail because the Pakistani court says that there were not enough menstrual cycles between his wife's divorce and his marriage. So you talked earlier about the Georgia law and that that was undermining Georgian democracy. Why does the - why is the State Department willing to weigh in on a law passed through the Georgian legislature, but for something insane like this, that's a matter for the Pakistani courts?\n\nMR MILLER: So I just don't have any further comment on the case. We look at - when we look at different countries, we take into account appropriate context, circumstances in making our judgments. We've addressed the question of Imran Khan many times. The legal proceedings against him are something for the Pakistani courts to decide in - I'd say in accordance with their laws and constitution.\n\nQUESTION: Could that really be - yeah. But could that really be a matter for the Pakistani courts? Is - could that possibly be the State Department's position?\n\nMR MILLER: It is our position that it - when you come to these laws in Pakistan and this court case, it is something for the Pakistani courts to decide. And you just saw, to this question, charges against him thrown out by the courts, so --\n\nQUESTION: Thank you so much. Regarding the trilateral deal between United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel that included a defense deal between United States and Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia and Israel normalization, we have seen that Secretary Blinken in a Senate hearing mentioned that United States and Saudi Arabia are very near to a defense deal. It seemed like U.S. is prioritizing its defense deal with Saudi Arabia but not the ties with the Israel, the basic offer that U.S. led from - for the mediation between Saudi Arabia and Israel. So with this testimony in the Senate hearing, is it, like, understood that it will be a bilateral deal only with the defense deal between Saudi Arabi and United States and the normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia sidelined?\n\nMR MILLER: No, the arrangement that we have contemplated, that we have been working on, is a agreement that encompasses three parties: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. There are bilateral pieces between the United States and Saudi Arabia that would be part of that deal, and that's what we have been working on, and then there are other components that are - that ultimately involve a path towards a Palestinian state.\n\nBut I will just say as all of - as part of all of this, you've heard the Secretary say this before. There are two - there is one thing that has to happen - two things. One I just referred to, that - the path to a Palestinian state. But the other thing that has to happen before any such arrangement can go forward is calm in Gaza. We don't have calm in Gaza today. We're trying to get to calm in Gaza through this ceasefire proposal, and you heard the President speak to normalization with Saudi Arabia being one of the benefits that it ultimately could unlock.\n\nQUESTION: Secondly, from the second time in 21 years, United States allowed a jailed Pakistani lady who is facing 86 years of, like, sentence in a Texas jail with the allegations of alleged attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan - that is Dr. Aafia Siddiqui. So former Pakistani caretaker government official in a private conversation told - he revealed that U.S. sent Pakistan a very closed deal, a possible deal between United States and Pakistan that might be a swap deal, basically. So you have any information on that? Is there something behind U.S. and Pakistan are considering that?\n\nMR MILLER: So let me take the question. I'm just not familiar with the full details of the case that you mentioned.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Matt. A question on T\u00fcrkiye. Today T\u00fcrkiye interior ministry, they removed a recently elected pro-Kurdish party and mayor of Hakkari and replaced him with a trustee. Do you have any reaction or comment on that?\n\nMR MILLER: So the - our position on the Kurdistan Workers' Party is well known; it hasn't changed. The PKK was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Department of State in 1997. And regarding the specific case you mentioned, I would refer you to the Government of T\u00fcrkiye for comment on that.\n\nQUESTION: And what's your approach to the Kurdish issue in T\u00fcrkiye? I mean, it's been a long time --\n\nMR MILLER: We have made clear our longstanding position on that many times. I don't have anything to add today. Go ahead here, and then we're going to have wrap for today.\n\nQUESTION: You said that you would hope that the Israeli law enforcement would follow through in curtailing violence from settlers in the West Bank. However, on Thursday - last Thursday - the Israeli military raided a vegetable market in Ramallah, in al-Bireh, to be specific, but one of the largest vegetable markets in the West Bank, and which lit on fire. And who's going to hold Israel accountable and the Israeli military in this sense? Which law enforcement authority should --\n\nMR MILLER: So a few things. First, I can't speak to that specific raid. Obviously, Israel has the right to conduct legitimate antiterrorism activities in the West Bank. We have seen them do so, but those need to be legitimate; they need to comply with international humanitarian law. But as regards to this particular incident, I can't speak to it at all.\n\nBut that said, when it comes to holding people accountable, we have seen the Israeli Government take some actions to police settler violence in the West Bank. We've seen them make arrests; we've seen them hold people accountable. But in our assessment, it hasn't been enough, and so that's why --\n\nQUESTION: But this wasn't settler.\n\nMR MILLER: But - I know. That's why I'm separating out the two. I can't - because I can't speak to this one without knowing the details. But when it comes to what I was speaking to, settler violence, they need to do more. And if they don't, we will. It's that clear.\n\nAnd with that, we'll wrap for today.

The first phase, which would last for six weeks, would include a temporary halt to the fighting and the withdrawal of Israel Defense Forces soldiers from populated areas of the Gaza Strip. Women, the elderly, ill, and infirmed would be freed in this phase, in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian security prisoners, while the remainder of the captives would be released in the second phase.\n\nNetanyahu stressed that Israel has gone a long way to return the hostages, \"while adhering to the objectives of the war, first and foremost the elimination of Hamas,\" the Post reported.\n\nIsrael is \"insistent that we will achieve both\" the return of the hostages and the destruction of Hamas, Netanyahu said.\n\n\"This is part of the outline\" Biden presented and \"not something that I have just added because of coalition pressure. This is something that we agreed on in the war cabinet unanimously,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nA senior Israeli official told Axios that Netanyahu's remarks are \"killing\" the \"constructive ambiguity\" of the deal by stressing the demands he will put on the table during the negotiations about Stage 2, even before the parties agreed to enter Stage 1.\n\nThe \"constructive ambiguity\" appears in two clauses of the Israeli proposal, according to Axios.\n\nOne clause states: \"No later than Day 16 the commencement of indirect negotiations between the two sides to agree on the conditions for implementing Stage 2 of this agreement, including those relating to the keys for the exchange of hostages and prisoners [soldiers and remaining men] and this should be concluded and agreed upon before the end of Week 5 of this stage.\"\n\nAnother states: \"All procedures in this stage, including the temporary cessation of military operations by both sides, aid and shelter effort, withdrawal of forces, etc., will continue in Stage 2 so long as the negotiations on the conditions for implementing Stage 2 of this agreement are ongoing. The guarantors of this agreement shall make every effort to ensure that those indirect negotiations continue until both sides are able to reach agreement on the conditions for implementing Stage 2 of this agreement.\"\n\n\"Instead of keeping things ambiguous, [Netanyahu's] statements are pushing Hamas to ask for more clarification, making it harder to get a deal,\" another Israeli official told Axios, adding this is happening because of Netanyahu's efforts to appease National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who leads Otzma Yehudit, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionist Party, and prevent a collapse of the coalition.\n\nThe prime minister's office didn't respond to a request for comment by Axios.\n\nMichael Katz \u2709\n\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax reporter with more than 30 years of experience reporting and editing on news, culture, and politics.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_katz@newsmax.com", "name": "Michael Katz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otzma_Yehudit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Otzma Yehudit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Zionist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religious Zionist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bezalel Smotrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=e0e29100-ddb4-4e91-b075-8b6d0121f7c0&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618758", "eventUri": "eng-9618758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

reporters on Monday night local time that the draft resolution proposed by Algeria regarding Rafah has been submitted and discussions are ongoing in this regard.\n\nHe also talked about efforts in elsewhere in the world to bring an end to the Gaza war. \"We are witnessing diplomatic developments in other regions in this regard, which is also important\".\n\nJoonkook declined to comment on the outcome of the negotiations on the Algerian draft at the 15-member council but said: \"As the head of the Security Council, we will try to facilitate the process of these talks about Rafah\".\n\nLast week, following the closed session of the Security Council regarding Israel's attack on the refugee camp in Rafah, Amar Bendjama, Algeria's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations announced that his country will present a draft resolution at the world body to demand an end to killings in Rafah, a city in the war-ravaged southern Gaza Strip.\n\nThe council has failed to reach a consensus to stop Israel's war on Gaza that has, so far, claimed more than 36,000 lives, mostly women and children.\n\nAfter passing two resolutions on the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, the council's several attempts to pass a resolution for a ceasefire were blocked by the United States, the Zionist regime's ally and key backer.\n\n4399", "source": {"uri": "en.irna.ir",

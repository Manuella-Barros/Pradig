David Nikel Hurtigruten is a well-known name among tourists with a keen interest in Scandinavian travel. Renowned for its scenic voyages along the Norwegian coast, Hurtigruten has been a staple in the Nordic travel industry for decades. What travelers might not realize is that Hurtigruten now offers three distinct types of cruise experiences in Norway, provided by two separate companies under the Hurtigruten brand. These experiences cater to different interests and expectations, making it essential for travelers to understand the nuances of each option before booking their trips. Whether you are looking for a classic coastal voyage, an Arctic expedition, or fancy trying out a new signature route, Hurtigruten has something to offer everyone with an interest in visiting Norway. Understanding the three options will help you select the experience that best aligns with your travel goals and ensure that your adventure through Norway's stunning landscapes and rich culture is everything you hope for.

Instead of focusing on onboard entertainment and luxury amenities, Hurtigruten emphasizes the natural beauty and cultural richness of Norway.

David Nikel Passengers can expect an immersive experience that brings them closer to Norway's stunning landscapes and unique wildlife. Most Hurtigruten ships are older cruise ferries, with a few newer expedition ships added to the fleet. All ships prioritize functionality and comfort over amenities. Regardless of the age of the ship, there is no onboard entertainment in the traditional cruising sense. Instead, the entertainment is the Norwegian coastline, wildlife, and some limited enrichment activities, such as lectures and occasional guided tours, depending on the itinerary. Excellent food is a feature across the fleet, with an emphasis on local and sustainable ingredients. Fish and seafood feature strongly on the dinner menus, while lavish breakfast and lunch buffet meals ensure passengers never go hungry. Norway\u2019s Historic Coastal Route Although the line has diversified since losing the exclusive rights to operate the route, Norway\u2019s historic coastal ferry route remains the backbone of Hurtigruten's offering. Daily departures from Bergen continue. Hurtigruten operates departures on seven of 11 days, with Havila Voyages operating the other four. There's a casual atmosphere aboard Hurtigruten's coastal route ships. David Nikel This route has been operating since 1893, serving as a lifeline for Norway\u2019s remote, coastal communities. Today, the journey stretches from Bergen in the southwest to Kirkenes in the northeast, covering over 2,500 miles. Passengers can embark on a full 11-night round trip from Bergen, take a one-way voyage, or do as the locals do and use the service as a ferry for shorter segments. Regardless of the option you pick, this route offers a thoroughly enjoyable blend of scenic beauty and cultural experiences. Passengers will see dramatic fjords, charming coastal towns, and the northern lights in the winter or the midnight sun in the summer. Multiple daily port calls allow for excursions and exploration in some ports, but many are short stops designed simply for the loading and unloading of cargo and local passengers. Hurtigruten\u2019s New Signature Voyages To mark the 130th anniversary of the coastal route and make more use of MS Trollfjord, Hurtigruten introduced two unique itineraries called the Svalbard Express and North Cape Express. The passenger-only voyages proved popular, so Hurtigruten recently made them a permanent addition to its program, with departures available from Bergen and Oslo. Now named \u2018Signature Voyages\u2019, the renamed Svalbard Line (summer) and North Cape Line (winter) offer unique itineraries with longer port stays, no local ferry service, all-inclusive Nordic cuisine, personalized guiding, and enrichment activities. Norway's North Cape has been a tourist destination for hundreds of years. David Nikel The experience is arguably better for experienced cruisers than the coastal route, with fewer, longer port calls, and a more cruise-like experience, despite still lacking the entertainment of traditional cruise lines. Expedition Cruises In Norway Now known as HX, Hurtigruten Expeditions offers expedition cruises across the world, but also in its home waters of Norway. These cruises are designed for those who want to explore remote and less-visited areas of Norway, often beyond the Arctic Circle. Expedition cruises are conducted on smaller, specialized ships equipped for polar waters and include a range of activities such as kayaking, hiking, and wildlife spotting. Passengers are accompanied by expert guides and scientists, who provide insights into the natural environment and local culture. These cruises retain the core of the Hurtigruten experience but offer a more rugged and hands-on approach to exploring Norway\u2019s wilderness. Available HX expedition cruises to Norway include exploring the Arctic winter aboard MS Spitsbergen or circumnavigations of Svalbard aboard MS Fram. Expedition cruises in Svalbard allow visitors to get closer to nature. getty The latter offers a much more in-depth exploration of Svalbard\u2019s glaciers and wildlife than some other lines' Svalbard cruises, which may make just one port call in Longyearbyen. Booking Tips For Hurtigruten Cruises In Norway Although Hurtigruten trips are a bucket list item for many travelers, research should be done in advance of booking to fully understand the ships, travel concept, and other factors that may impact enjoyment. That\u2019s especially true for someone used to traditional cruising. Hurtigruten\u2019s smaller ships mean that guests will feel the movement of the ocean more. On the coastal route, certain stretches such as rounding Norway\u2019s West Cape and crossing Vestfjorden towards Lofoten are renowned for their rough seas, especially when sailing outside of the summer season. Hurtigruten fares are also higher than guests may expect, especially on the coastal route. Part of the reason for this is the coastal route ships are subject to local laws and must use Norwegian-speaking crew primarily for safety reasons. This requires the payment of relatively high salaries and imposing high taxes on alcohol, among other factors, that keep prices higher than some alternative travel options. Despite the high prices, there\u2019s a lot to love about the Hurtigruten experience in Norway, which keeps many travelers coming back year after year. The breathtaking natural landscapes, rich cultural experiences, and unique itineraries that cater to a range of interests make Hurtigruten cruises a standout choice for exploring Norway.

Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division, said in a statement. \"We have brought this action to ensure that Iowa adheres to the framework adopted by Congress and the Constitution for regulation of immigration.\"\n\nThe federal action was expected, as the Department of Justice warned Iowa's top officials last week that the agency would sue unless they agreed not to enforce the new law. The law is similar to a more expansive Texas statute that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuit was filed on the same day the ACLU of Iowa, national ACLU and the American Immigration Council filed suit to to block the law on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individual Iowans.\n\n\"This ugly law is deeply harmful to Iowa families and communities,\" said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director of The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. \"Iowa lawmakers knowingly targeted people who are protected by federal immigration laws and who are legally allowed to be here.\"\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said Thursday that the state would not back down, and that the law existed because President Joe Biden hasn't secured the southern border.\n\n\"Iowa's law is not unique; it simply enforces immigration laws while Biden refuses to,\" Bird said in a written statement. \"Iowa stands ready to defend our immigration law that keeps Iowa communities safe.\"\n\nThe Iowa law has increased fear among immigrant communities in the state that enforcement would lead to racial and ethnic profiling, complicate interactions with police or dissuade community members from reporting crime. Activist and advocacy groups, including one named in the suit, have hosted gatherings to try to answer people's questions and organized protests in response.\n\nTexas was allowed to enforce the law for only a few confusing hours in March before it was put on hold by a federal appeals court's three-judge panel.

The suit said the law could result in the prosecution of children brought to Iowa by their parents.\n\n\"It will create absolute chaos and human suffering in our legal system, and harm Iowa communities,\" said Melloy Goettel, legal director at the American Immigration Council.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the new legislation into law, reiterated her support for the change.\n\n\"As Governor, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of Iowa,\" Reynolds said in a written statement that repeated the arguments of other Republican leaders. \"Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation's immigration laws -- threatening the safety of our citizens -- Iowa

Civil Rights Groups Are Suing", "body": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Civil rights and immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit on Thursday alleging that Iowa's new law making it a crime to be in the state if previously denied admission to the U.S. is unconstitutional.\n\nIt's the first legal action taken against Iowa in response to the law, though the U.S. Department of Justice warned the state's top officials last week that the agency would sue unless they agreed not to enforce it.\n\nThe complaint filed Thursday alleges that the new statute steps on the federal government's authority to enforce immigration law. The case is similar to a more expansive Texas law that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said Friday that the state would not back down.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa and the American Immigration Council filed the suit Thursday on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individual Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa law has increased fear among immigrant communities in the state that enforcement would lead to racial and ethnic profiling, complicate interactions with police or dissuade community members from reporting crime. Activist and advocacy groups, including one named in the suit, have hosted gatherings to try to answer people's questions and organized protests in response.\n\nTexas was allowed to enforce the law for only a few confusing hours in March before it was put on hold by a federal appeals court's three-judge panel. The panel heard arguments by both supporters and opponents in April, and will next issue a decision on the law's constitutionality.\n\nSome law enforcement officials and legal experts have said unanswered questions remain about how the laws in Iowa and Texas would be implemented, since enforcement of immigration law has historically fallen to the federal government and is a binational process.\n\nThe Iowa law, which goes into effect on July 1, would allow criminal charges to be brought against people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously have been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted.\n\nIn Iowa and across the country, Republican leaders accuse Democratic President Joe Biden of failing to manage the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"The only reason we had to pass this law is because the Biden Administration refuses to enforce the laws already on the books,\" Reynolds said in a statement Friday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Kim Reynolds criminalizes \"illegal reentry\" into the state, tasking Iowa officers with arresting undocumented immigrants who have previously been deported.\n\nBut police chiefs across the state say they lack both guidance from the state and the resources and training to take on responsibilities usually held by federal officers.\n\nAnd they expressed apparent misgivings about whether they could enforce the law.\n\n\"We weren't consulted on it,\" said Greg Stallman, the legislative chair for the Iowa Police Chiefs Association and chief in Altoona. \"So we're unaware of what the intent of this legislation is, or what they're trying to get accomplished.\"\n\nThe state Senate bill has been touted by Reynolds as a response to the Biden administration on immigration, granting Iowa officers the power to \"enforce immigration laws already on the books.\"\n\nIt creates the new state crime of \"illegal reentry,\" which applies to anyone who has previously been deported, removed, or denied admission to the United States.\n\nIn most cases, the offense is an aggravated misdemeanor, which carries a two-year prison sentence. In certain circumstances, it can rise to a class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. If the person had been previously arrested for another felony, it can become a class C felony, with up to 10 years of prison time. The law takes effect July 1.\n\nMore: Justice Department warns it will sue if Iowa tries to enforce its new immigration law\n\nAs she defended the law in comments to reporters Wednesday, the governor said law enforcement had been briefed before it was signed.\n\n\"Well, make no mistake, we talked to them,\" Reynolds said. \"We talked to them before we implemented it.\"\n\nShe pledged to continue communicating with police about the measure and, if necessary, provide additional guidance.\n\n\"Of course, we'll continue to work with them,\" Reynolds said. \"And if we need additional legislation or if we need to provide rulemaking authority or whatever we need to do, we'll work with (Public Safety) Commissioner (Stephan) Bayens, and we'll make sure that information gets out to law enforcement.\n\nMore: Federal appeals court keeps hold on Texas' sweeping immigration in new ruling\n\n\"But at least it begins to give them a tool to address,\" she added, \"and it just, it sends a message.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice wrote to Reynolds and Attorney General Brenna Bird that the department would sue to block the law if it was still being enforced on May 7.\n\nMultiple current and former police chiefs who spoke to the Des Monies Register said the responsibilities laid out for officers in the law were beyond both their resources and their management capabilities.\n\nDes Moines Police Dana Wingert said in a statement that when a person is arrested, their immigration status is checked during booking at Polk County Jail. But confirming a person's immigration status short of that falls to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- a federal agency. Local police lack access to such a database.\n\n\"I'm not interested, nor are we equipped, funded or staffed to take on additional responsibilities that historically have never been a function of local law enforcement,\" Wingert said.\n\nConfusion persists, too, about the process after a person is brought to court and convicted. The law requires a judge to issue an order \"requiring the person to return to the foreign nation\" from which they entered.\n\nThat order must specify how to transport the person to a legal port of entry and the officer or state agency \"responsible for monitoring compliance.\"\n\nPaul Allen, county attorney for Buena Vista County in northwest Iowa, said that needs more clarity.\n\n\"That's not really on a prosecutor's office, but that isn't fleshed out in the statutes,\" Allen said. \"I don't know if they're planning administrative rules or something like that, but I'm not sure how that would work.\"\n\nMore: Trump's promises to 'drill, baby, drill' and kick out migrants are at odds. Here's why.\n\nA former Iowa public safety director said the law, even if properly enforced, would place a further administrative burden on already stretched-thin departments.\n\n\"You've created a law in a negligent fashion that's full of fearmongering to our immigrant community, with no process on how it's going to work,\" said Mark Prosser, who now serves as a Catholic deacon and is on the national Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force.\n\n\"Our chiefs and sheriffs, they'll come out, and they'll have to determine if they even have the staff to do it,\" Prosser added. \"And in most cases, they don't because they're struggling to maintain staffing for their current levels of calls for service.\"\n\nState officials are still examining the law but have not issued guidelines on enforcement or prosecution.\n\nA spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Public Safety said in a statement that \"to the extent other law enforcement agencies may seek our input, we provide it but generally do not issue statewide guidance to all law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nDPS is \"still working through the language of SF 2340 and how it can be enforced,\" according to the statement, and preliminary enforcement \"will likely turn on cooperation from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" and its database of those deported or removed from the country.\n\nBird's office has also not issued guidance on prosecutions under the law to county attorneys, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nThe chief of staff for Polk County Attorney Kimberly Graham said in an email that their office will \"judge each case referred to us on its individual merits,\" and that Graham had discussed the legislation with police chiefs.\n\nOne of the top concerns stemming from the law, chiefs said, was how it could affect departments' relationships with immigrant communities.\n\n\"I'll tell you what's going to lead an officer to ask questions -- it's going to be unintentional, or maybe in some cases intentional profiling,\" said Prosser, who also served as police chief in Storm Lake. \"They're going to ask that question to individuals of color, or who speak a different language.\"\n\n\"And it's going to take our officers and our law enforcement professionals into a slippery slope,\" Prosser added.\n\nMarshalltown Chief of Police Michael Tupper said he was \"already seeing some negative impact\" in his city, which is 33.6% Hispanic or Latino and home to many who work at the JBS meatpacking plant.\n\n\"I think our community's worried about profiling,\" Tupper said. \"We don't want people to be afraid to call the police.\"\n\nHe added that the law would also give more ammunition to criminals who point to the law to evade law enforcement.\n\n\"They will tell people, 'You can't call the police,'\" Tupper said. \"We already see that now. We already see criminals telling people, 'If you call the police, you're going to be deported.'\"\n\nLike Texas law, it's modeled after Iowa's law, poised to be fought in court.\n\nA top DOJ official warned Reynolds and Bird in a letter last week that the department will take action if the law remains in effect by May 7.\n\n\"The only reason we had to pass this law is because the Biden administration refuses to enforce the laws already on the books,\" Reynolds said in response to the letter. \"I have a duty to protect the citizens of Iowa. Unlike the federal government, we will respect and enforce the rule of law.\"\n\nMore: Can the US handle more immigration? History and the Census suggest the answer is yes.\n\nBird said, \"Iowa will not back down and stand by as our state's safety hangs in the balance. If Biden refuses to stop the border invasion and keep our communities safe, Iowa will do the job for him.\"\n\nTexas' law, which the DOJ also took to court, is currently blocked while the lawsuit is decided.\n\nAdvocacy groups, including the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, have strongly opposed Iowa's law, calling it a \"ridiculous stunt\" to \"perpetuate partisan campaign rhetoric.\" Last week, protests were organized around the state in response to the law.\n\nThe ACLU of Iowa declined to comment but referred the Register to its statement from April 10 calling the law \"one of the most extreme, discriminatory, and unconstitutional anti-immigrant bills in the country.\"\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller contributed reporting.\n\nGalen Bacharier covers the Statehouse & politics for the Register.

But confirming a person's immigration status short of that falls to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- a federal agency. Local police lack access to such a database.\n\n\"I'm not interested, nor are we equipped, funded or staffed to take on additional responsibilities that historically have never been a function of local law enforcement,\" Wingert said.\n\nConfusion persists, too, about the process after a person is brought to court and convicted. The law requires a judge to issue an order \"requiring the person to return to the foreign nation\" from which they entered.\n\nThat order must specify how to transport that person to a legal port of entry, as well as the officer or state agency \"responsible for monitoring compliance.\"\n\nPaul Allen, county attorney for Buena Vista County in northwest Iowa, said that needs more clarity.\n\n\"That's not really on a prosecutor's office, but that isn't fleshed out in the statutes,\" Allen said. \"I don't know if they're planning administrative rules or something like that, but I'm not sure how that would work.\"\n\nA former Iowa public safety director said the law, even if properly enforced, would place a further administrative burden on departments that are already stretched thin.\n\n\"You've created a law in a negligent fashion that's full of fearmongering to our immigrant community, with no process on how it's going to work,\" said Mark Prosser, who now serves as a Catholic deacon and is on the national Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force.\n\n\"Our chiefs and sheriffs, they'll come out and they'll have to determine if they even have the staff to do it,\" Prosser added. \"And in most cases, they don't, because they're struggling to maintain staffing for their current levels of calls for service.\"\n\nState officials are still examining the law but have not issued guidelines on enforcement or prosecution.\n\nA spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Public Safety said in a statement that \"to the extent other law enforcement agencies may seek our input, we provide it but generally do not issue statewide guidance to all law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nDPS is \"still working through the language of SF 2340 and the ways it can be enforced,\" according to the statement, and preliminary enforcement \"will likely turn on cooperation from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" and its database of those deported or removed from the country.\n\nBird's office has also not issued guidance on prosecutions under the law to county attorneys, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nThe chief of staff for Polk County Attorney Kimberly Graham said in an email that their office will \"judge each case referred to us on its individual merits,\" and that Graham had discussed the legislation with police chiefs.\n\nOne of the top concerns stemming from the law, chiefs said, was how it could affect departments' relationships with immigrant communities.\n\n\"I'll tell you what's going to lead an officer to ask questions -- it's going to be unintentional, or maybe in some cases intentional profiling,\" said Prosser, who also served as police chief in Storm Lake. \"They're going to ask that question to individuals of color, or who speak a different language.\"\n\n\"And it's going to take our officers and our law enforcement professionals into a slippery slope,\" Prosser added.\n\nMarshalltown Chief of Police Michael Tupper said he was \"already seeing some negative impact\" in his city, which is 33.6% Hispanic or Latino and home to many who work at the JBS meatpacking plant.\n\n\"I think our community's worried about profiling,\" Tupper said. \"We don't want people to be afraid to call the police.\"\n\nHe added that the law would also give more ammunition to criminals who point to the law to evade law enforcement.\n\n\"They will tell people, 'You can't call the police,'\" Tupper said. \"We already see that now. We already see criminals telling people, 'If you call the police, you're going to deported.'\"\n\nLike the Texas law it's modeled after, Iowa's law is poised to be fought in court.\n\nA top DOJ official warned Reynolds and Bird in a letter last week that if the law remains in effect by May 7, the department will take action.\n\n\"The only reason we had to pass this law is because the Biden administration refuses to enforce the laws already on the books,\" Reynolds said in response to the letter. \"I have a duty to protect the citizens of Iowa. Unlike the federal government, we will respect the rule of law and enforce it.\"\n\nBird said that \"Iowa will not back down and stand by as our state's safety hangs in the balance. If Biden refuses to stop the border invasion and keep our communities safe, Iowa will do the job for him.\"\n\nTexas' law, which the DOJ also took to court, is currently blocked while the lawsuit is decided.\n\nIowa's law has been strongly opposed by advocacy groups, including Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, which called it a \"ridiculous stunt\" to \"perpetuate partisan campaign rhetoric.\" Protests were organized around the state last week in response to the law.\n\nThe ACLU of Iowa declined comment but referred the Register to its statement from April 10 calling the law \"one of the most extreme, discriminatory and unconstitutional anti-immigrant bills in the country.\"\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller contributed reporting.\n\nGalen Bacharier covers the Statehouse & politics for the Register.

In certain circumstances, it can rise to a class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.

The federal government and civil rights groups are suing", "body": "By HANNAH FINGERHUT - Associated Press\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The U.S. Justice Department sued Iowa on Thursday over its new law that would give the state the authority to arrest and deport some migrants, making it the second lawsuit filed in a single day that seeks to block legislation passed earlier this year by state lawmakers.\n\nBoth the Justice Department's lawsuit and another suit filed by civil rights and immigrant rights groups argued the state law was preempted by federal law and should be declared invalid.\n\n\"Iowa cannot disregard the U.S. Constitution and settled Supreme Court precedent,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division, said in a statement. \"We have brought this action to ensure that Iowa adheres to the framework adopted by Congress and the Constitution for regulation of immigration.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Schemenauer Extra Effort: Luther High student overcomes school difficulties on her way to education career American Airlines reintroduces higher capacity E175 jets at La Crosse Regional Airport Extra effort: Holmen teen with brain tumor achieves academic success\n\nThe federal action was expected, as the Department of Justice warned Iowa's top officials last week that the agency would sue unless they agreed not to enforce the new law. The law is similar to a more expansive Texas statute that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuit was filed on the same day the ACLU of Iowa, national ACLU and the American Immigration Council filed suit to to block the law on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individual Iowans.\n\n\"This ugly law is deeply harmful to Iowa families and communities,\" said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director of The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. \"Iowa lawmakers knowingly targeted people who are protected by federal immigration laws and who are legally allowed to be here.\"\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said Thursday that the state would not back down, and that the law existed because President Joe Biden hasn't secured the southern border.\n\n\"Iowa's law is not unique; it simply enforces immigration laws while Biden refuses to,\" Bird said in a written statement. \"Iowa stands ready to defend our immigration law that keeps Iowa communities safe.\"\n\nThe Iowa law has increased fear among immigrant communities in the state that enforcement would lead to racial and ethnic profiling, complicate interactions with police or dissuade community members from reporting crime. Activist and advocacy groups, including one named in the suit, have hosted gatherings to try to answer people's questions and organized protests in response.\n\nTexas was allowed to enforce the law for only a few confusing hours in March before it was put on hold by a federal appeals court's three-judge panel. The panel heard arguments by both supporters and opponents in April, and will next issue a decision on the law's constitutionality.\n\nSome law enforcement officials and legal experts have said unanswered questions remain about how the laws in Iowa and Texas would be implemented, since enforcement of immigration law has historically fallen to the federal government and is a binational process.\n\nThe Iowa law, which goes into effect on July 1, would allow criminal charges to be brought against people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously have been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted, potentially facing time in prison before deportation.\n\nThe federal lawsuit states that because the Constitution assigns the task of regulating immigration and managing international borders to federal government, the state law should not be enforced.\n\nThe Iowa lawsuit also contends that the law conflicts with federal law and could direct police to arrest people who are authorized to be in the U.S., such as people who have been granted asylum or have visas. The suit said the law could result in the prosecution of children brought to Iowa by their parents.\n\n\"It will create absolute chaos and human suffering in our legal system, and harm Iowa communities,\" said Melloy Goettel, legal director at the American Immigration Council.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the new legislation into law, reiterated her support for the change.\n\n\"As Governor, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of Iowa,\" Reynolds said in a written statement that repeated the arguments of other Republican leaders. \"Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation's immigration laws -- threatening the safety of our citizens -- Iowa will step in.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Civil rights groups are suing", "body": "By HANNAH FINGERHUT - Associated Press\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A new law in Iowa that makes it a crime to be in the state if previously denied admission to the U.S. conflicts with federal law and could lead to the deportation of people who are legally in the country, civil rights and immigrant rights groups argue in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday.\n\nThe suit marks the first legal action taken against Iowa in response to the law, though the U.S. Department of Justice warned the state's top officials last week that the agency would sue unless they agreed not to enforce it.\n\nThe complaint filed in U.S. District Court alleges that the new statute steps on the federal government's authority to enforce immigration law. The law is similar to a more expansive Texas statute that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nFamily Resources in Davenport to lay off 26 Two dead after shooting in Moline Sunday, police ask public for photo, video evidence Woman gives CPR after shooting in East Moline, police chief confirms one dead Teens killed in Moline Sunday were friends, both fondly remembered Officials identify two people shot and killed Sunday in Moline A violent Sunday leaves one dead in East Moline, two killed in Moline Alabama man arrested in relation to killing in East Moline, victim identified Muscatine furry discusses lifestyle, social media posts Davenport man faces three felony charges for allegedly defrauding multiple area banks Davenport collapse lawsuits: City files appeal to Iowa Supreme Court Two killed in separate crashes Wednesday in East Moline Davenport man was under surveillance, subject of investigation before he was killed Davenport businesses sue city, HESCO over 2019 flood losses Unidentified company considering Davenport for $800 million data center Davenport Learning Center to re-launch programming for alternative education, IEP students\n\n\"This ugly law is deeply harmful to Iowa families and communities,\" said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director of The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. \"Iowa lawmakers knowingly targeted people who are protected by federal immigration laws and who are legally allowed to be here.\"\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said Thursday that the state would not back down, and that the law existed because President Joe Biden hasn't secured the southern border.\n\n\"Iowa's law is not unique; it simply enforces immigration laws while Biden refuses to,\" Bird said in a written statement. \"Iowa stands ready to defend our immigration law that keeps Iowa communities safe.\"\n\nThe ACLU of Iowa, national ACLU and the American Immigration Council filed the suit Thursday on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individual Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa law has increased fear among immigrant communities in the state that enforcement would lead to racial and ethnic profiling, complicate interactions with police or dissuade community members from reporting crime. Activist and advocacy groups, including one named in the suit, have hosted gatherings to try to answer people's questions and organized protests in response.\n\nTexas was allowed to enforce the law for only a few confusing hours in March before it was put on hold by a federal appeals court's three-judge panel. The panel heard arguments by both supporters and opponents in April, and will next issue a decision on the law's constitutionality.\n\nSome law enforcement officials and legal experts have said unanswered questions remain about how the laws in Iowa and Texas would be implemented, since enforcement of immigration law has historically fallen to the federal government and is a binational process.\n\nThe Iowa law, which goes into effect on July 1, would allow criminal charges to be brought against people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously have been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted, potentially facing time in prison before deportation.\n\nThe Iowa lawsuit contends that the law conflicts with federal law and could direct police to arrest people who are authorized to be in the U.S., such as people who have been granted asylum or have visas. The suit said the law could result in the prosecution of children brought to Iowa by their parents.\n\n\"It will create absolute chaos and human suffering in our legal system, and harm Iowa communities,\" said Melloy Goettel, legal director at the American Immigration Council.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the new legislation into law, reiterated her support for the change.\n\n\"As Governor, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of Iowa,\" Reynolds said in a written statement that repeated the arguments of other Republican leaders. \"Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation's immigration laws -- threatening the safety of our citizens -- Iowa will step in.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Kim Reynolds, grants local and state law enforcement the ability to arrest and press charges against illegal immigrants who have outstanding deportation orders, or who have reentered the U.S. after being previously deported or denied access to the interior of the country. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Iowa and the American Immigration Council are suing Iowa over the law on claims that it is unconstitutional and will disproportionately affect the state's immigrant population.\n\n\"Supporters of this law say they passed it because they are tired of the way the federal government and the current administration is handling immigration enforcement. We can all agree that our immigration system needs improvement, but this law is no solution,\" Erica Johnson, founding executive director of Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, claimed in a statement on Thursday. \"Instead, it increases fear among Iowa's immigrant communities and overwhelms local groups who are doing the real work of finding solutions and creating thriving communities.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the state law hamstrings the Biden administration's ability to enforce federal immigration laws, according to NBC News. ACLU of Iowa also claims it will increase racial profiling and result in the separation of families.\n\nThe Biden administration's Department of Justice was previously threatening to sue Iowa unless it dropped the law from the books. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird previously said the state wouldn't give in to pressure on repealing the law.\n\n\"Iowa won't back down. We will defend our law, even if the federal government is going to sue us,\" Bird during a Fox News interview on May 5. \"Iowa has an immigration problem. Iowa isn't a border state, we're a long way from the border, but now every state is a border state with the border so out of control.\"\n\nSF 2340 is set to go into effect on July 1.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to keep states including Iowa and Texas from enforcing stricter laws to curtail the illegal immigration crisis. The administration has been in an ongoing legal battle with Texas, which has deployed the state National Guard to its southern border and has prevented Border Patrol from intervening in border enforcement activities.\n\nIllegal immigration has surged under the Biden administration; Border Patrol recorded roughly 1.6 million migrant encounters at the southern border in fiscal year 2021, compared to over 2 million in fiscal year 2023 and over a million in the first six months of fiscal year 2024, according to Customs and Border Protection data.", "source": {"uri":

Civil rights groups are suing", "body": "By HANNAH FINGERHUT - Associated Press\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Civil rights and immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit on Thursday alleging that Iowa's new law making it a crime to be in the state if previously denied admission to the U.S. is unconstitutional.\n\nIt's the first legal action taken against Iowa in response to the law, though the U.S. Department of Justice warned the state's top officials last week that the agency would sue unless they agreed not to enforce it.\n\nThe complaint filed Thursday alleges that the new statute steps on the federal government's authority to enforce immigration law. The case is similar to a more expansive Texas law that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nSpokesman says second David Schultz autopsy to proceed without body, calls out Facebook group Hinton woman boarded freight train rather than drive home drunk 64-year-old driver dies in South Sioux City crash North Sioux City propane explosion kills three in fire DEAR ABBY: Bitter son won't allow mom to find happiness 7 arrested in 2-day prostitution operation in Sioux City Landlords plan sale of Sioux City's Tip Top Tux, Dream Dress Express inventory Man linked to missing Nebraska girl faces federal charges in Sioux City Iowa Landscaping Company: 'Anything anybody can dream of, we can pretty much do.'

Activist and advocacy groups, including one named in the suit, have hosted gatherings to try to answer people's questions and organized protests in response.\n\nTexas was allowed to enforce the law for only a few confusing hours in March before it was put on hold by a federal appeals court's three-judge panel. The panel heard arguments by both supporters and opponents in April, and will next issue a decision on the law's constitutionality.\n\nSome law enforcement officials and legal experts have said unanswered questions remain about how the laws in Iowa and Texas would be implemented, since enforcement of immigration law has historically fallen to the federal government and is a binational process.\n\nThe Iowa law, which goes into effect on July 1, would allow criminal charges to be brought against people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously have been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted.\n\nIn Iowa and across the country, Republican leaders accuse Democratic President Joe Biden of failing to manage the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"The only reason we had to pass this law is because the Biden Administration refuses to enforce the laws already on the books,\" Reynolds said in a statement Friday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And the law provides no opportunity to raise humanitarian claims for protection from removal enshrined in federal immigration law and international conventions.\"\n\nIn addition, they allege that the law does not prohibit the prosecution of children or adults who were removed or deported and then returned as children.\n\nThe law violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, the group's charge, by implementing a \"patently illegal\" plan to \"replace Congress' immigration scheme with its own.\"\n\nThe American Immigration Council, American Civil Liberties Union, and ACLU of Iowa filed the suit on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice.

civil groups sue Iowa over immigrant arrest law", "body": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\nMay 9 (Reuters) - The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden filed a lawsuit on Thursday seeking to block an Iowa law authorizing the arrest and prosecution of people who have returned to the U.S. after being deported, as a growing number of Republican-led states consider similar proposals.\n\nThe complaint filed in Des Moines, Iowa, federal court by the U.S. Department of Justice claims that the law known as S.F. 2340 unlawfully interferes with the federal government's ability to enforce U.S. immigration law.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other civil rights groups filed a similar lawsuit in the same court earlier on Thursday.\n\nThe Biden administration and the ACLU have made the same argument in lawsuits challenging a similar Texas law that has served as a model for Republican lawmakers across the country who say President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has failed to address a recent increase in illegal border crossings.\n\nIowa's law makes \"illegal reentry\" into the state a crime punishable by up to two years in prison and authorizes state judges to order that individuals return to their home countries after serving sentences.\n\nThe lawsuits filed on Thursday say S.F. 2340 clashes with the system created by federal law for deporting people who are in the country illegally.\n\nAnd the state law does not exempt people who have legal status in the United States, including asylum applicants and recipients of visas for survivors of domestic violence, the civil rights groups said.\n\n\"There are lots of good reasons - related to foreign relations, national security, humanitarian interests, and our constitutional system - why the federal government enforces our immigration law, instead of all 50 states going out and doing their own thing,\" said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director of the ACLU's Iowa chapter.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the law last month, in a statement said she has a responsibility to protect Iowans.\n\n\"Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation\u00b4s immigration laws - threatening the safety of our citizens - Iowa will step in,\" Reynolds said.\n\nA U.S. appeals court in March blocked a Texas law that also allows state officials to arrest, prosecute and order the removal of suspected migrants while it considers the state's appeal of a judge's ruling that said it was invalid.\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma last week enacted a law that is similar to the measures in Texas and Iowa, and several other states are considering bills.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Aurora Ellis)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

Kim Reynolds, grants local and state law enforcement the ability to arrest and press charges against illegal immigrants who have outstanding deportation orders, or who have reentered the U.S. after being previously deported or denied access to the interior of the country. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Iowa and the American Immigration Council are suing Iowa over the law on claims that it is unconstitutional and will disproportionately affect the state's immigrant population. (RELATED: Biden's DOJ Threatens To Sue Another State For Enforcing Immigration Law)\n\n\"Supporters of this law say they passed it because they are tired of the way the federal government and the current administration is handling immigration enforcement. We can all agree that our immigration system needs improvement, but this law is no solution,\" Erica Johnson, founding executive director of Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, claimed in a statement on Thursday. \"Instead, it increases fear among Iowa's immigrant communities and overwhelms local groups who are doing the real work of finding solutions and creating thriving communities.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the state law hamstrings the Biden administration's ability to enforce federal immigration laws, according to NBC News. ACLU of Iowa also claims it will increase racial profiling and result in the separation of families.\n\nThe Biden administration's Department of Justice was previously threatening to sue Iowa unless it dropped the law from the books. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird previously said the state wouldn't give in to pressure on repealing the law.\n\n\"Iowa won't back down. We will defend our law, even if the federal government is going to sue us,\" Bird during a Fox News interview on May 5. \"Iowa has an immigration problem. Iowa isn't a border state, we're a long way from the border, but now every state is a border state with the border so out of control.\"\n\nSF 2340 is set to go into effect on July 1.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to keep states including Iowa and Texas from enforcing stricter laws to curtail the illegal immigration crisis. The administration has been in an ongoing legal battle with Texas, which has deployed the state National Guard to its southern border and has prevented Border Patrol from intervening in border enforcement activities.\n\nIllegal immigration has surged under the Biden administration; Border Patrol recorded roughly 1.6 million migrant encounters at the southern border in fiscal year 2021, compared to over 2 million in fiscal year 2023 and over a million in the first six months of fiscal year 2024, according to Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

And the state law does not exempt people who have legal status in the United States, including asylum applicants and recipients of visas for survivors of domestic violence, the groups said.\n\n\"There are lots of good reasons -- related to foreign relations, national security, humanitarian interests, and our constitutional system -- why the federal government enforces our immigration law, instead of all 50 states going out and doing their own thing,\" said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director of the ACLU's Iowa chapter.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the law last month, in a statement said she has a responsibility to protect Iowans.\n\n\"Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation's immigration laws - threatening the safety of our citizens - Iowa will step in,\" Reynolds said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice last week warned Reynolds that it would sue to block Iowa's law if it takes effect, as it did in challenging the law adopted by Texas.\n\nA U.S. appeals court in March blocked the Texas law while it considers the state's appeal of a judge's ruling that said it was invalid.\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma last week enacted a law that is similar to the measures in Texas and Iowa, and several other states are considering bills.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Aurora Ellis)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The law criminalizes illegal reentry into the state and allows Iowa law enforcement officers to arrest undocumented immigrants who have previously been deported.\n\nThe new law is being challenged by a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Iowa, said Rita Bettis Austin, Legal Director of the ACLU of Iowa in a Zoom press conference with other litigants. \"Today we filed a lawsuit challenging SF 2340, which is Iowa's extreme anti-immigrant. Law. Our co-counsel in the case are the American Immigration Council and the National ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project. We are representing the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individuals who are impacted by this law. They're proceeding in the case under pseudonyms as Jane Doe and Elizabeth Roe.\"\n\n\"There are many very important reasons why we have just one federal immigration system and not 50 separate legal systems,\" she continued. \"SF 2340 conflicts with federal immigration law in ways that are very harmful to immigrants in Iowa. For example, it criminalizes people who do have the legal authority to be present in our country and in our state but have been removed in the past. The law makes no defenses for them. It has no exceptions for them, as our two green card holder clients make clear. It would likewise apply to people who have been granted asylum or may have special visas given to them because they're survivors of domestic violence or other crimes. It would allow them to be prosecuted and it doesn't make any exception for people who were removed or reentered with their families when they were children.\"\n\nKate Melloy Goettel, senior legal director at the American Immigration Council explains why having state by state immigration laws is dangerous. \"The crux of this lawsuit is that it challenges the state's ability to create its own immigration system, flouting more than a century of law that leaves that work to the federal government. We don't want 50 state governments coming up with 50 different immigration systems. One of the problems with SF 2340 is that even a person who now has lawful immigration status, like our two plaintiffs in this lawsuit who have green cards, they could be prosecuted under this law if they were previously deported from the country and reentered. It's a law that makes absolutely no sense and is clearly unconstitutional.\"\n\nErica Johnson, founding executive director with Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, says the law causes more problems than it solves. \"Supporters of this law say that they passed it because they're tired of the way that the federal government in the current administration is handling immigration enforcement. I think we can all agree that our immigration system needs improvement, but this law is no solution. Instead, what we have seen it do is increase fear among Iowa's immigrant and refugee communities. It's also just an incredibly inhumane law that puts the lives of families at risk. It takes people, including children, as we've heard, who had been living here peacefully and contributing to their communities, sometimes for decades, and sets them up for deportation. In Iowa, we need real laws that create workable, orderly humane immigration systems and the fact is that Senate file 2340 does just the opposite.\"\n\nThe groups are filing a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking the federal district court to block the law during the litigation, and before July 1, which is when it is scheduled to take effect unless the court blocks it. The motion may be filed as early as tomorrow.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Immigration_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Immigration Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Meanwhile, Oklahoma last week enacted a law that is similar to the measures in Texas and Iowa, and several other states are considering bills.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_49_14_1279651.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553987", "eventUri": "eng-9553987", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division, said in a statement. \"We have brought this action to ensure that Iowa adheres to the framework adopted by Congress and the Constitution for regulation of immigration.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The law is similar to a more expansive Texas statute that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuit was filed on the same day the ACLU of Iowa, national ACLU and the American Immigration Council filed suit to to block the law on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individual Iowans.\n\n\"This ugly law is deeply harmful to Iowa families and communities,\" said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director of The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. \"Iowa lawmakers knowingly targeted people who are protected by federal immigration laws and who are legally allowed to be here.\"\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said Thursday that the state would not back down, and that the law existed because President Joe Biden hasn't secured the southern border.\n\n\"Iowa's law is not unique; it simply enforces immigration laws while Biden refuses to,\" Bird said in a written statement. \"Iowa stands ready to defend our immigration law that keeps Iowa communities safe.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe Iowa law has increased fear among immigrant communities in the state that enforcement would lead to racial and ethnic profiling, complicate interactions with police or dissuade community members from reporting crime. Activist and advocacy groups, including one named in the suit, have hosted gatherings to try to answer people's questions and organized protests in response.\n\nTexas was allowed to enforce the law for only a few confusing hours in March before it was put on hold by a federal appeals court's three-judge panel. The panel heard arguments by both supporters and opponents in April, and will next issue a decision on the law's constitutionality.\n\nSome law enforcement officials and legal experts have said unanswered questions remain about how the laws in Iowa and Texas would be implemented, since enforcement of immigration law has historically fallen to the federal government and is a binational process.\n\nThe Iowa law, which goes into effect on July 1, would allow criminal charges to be brought against people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously have been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted, potentially facing time in prison before deportation.\n\nThe federal lawsuit states that because the Constitution assigns the task of regulating immigration and managing international borders to federal government, the state law should not be enforced.\n\nThe Iowa lawsuit also contends that the law conflicts with federal law and could direct police to arrest people who are authorized to be in the U.S., such as people who have been granted asylum or have visas. The suit said the law could result in the prosecution of children brought to Iowa by their parents.\n\n\"It will create absolute chaos and human suffering in our legal system, and harm Iowa communities,\" said Melloy Goettel, legal director at the American Immigration Council.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the new legislation into law, reiterated her support for the change.\n\n\"As Governor, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of Iowa,\" Reynolds said in a written statement that repeated the arguments of other Republican leaders. \"Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation's immigration laws -- threatening the safety of our citizens -- Iowa will step in.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The law is similar to a more expansive Texas statute that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuit was filed on the same day the ACLU of Iowa, national ACLU and the American Immigration Council filed suit to to block the law on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individual Iowans.\n\n\"This ugly law is deeply harmful to Iowa families and communities,\" said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director of The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. \"Iowa lawmakers knowingly targeted people who are protected by federal immigration laws and who are legally allowed to be here.\"\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said Thursday that the state would not back down, and that the law existed because President Joe Biden hasn't secured the southern border.\n\n\"Iowa's law is not unique; it simply enforces immigration laws while Biden refuses to,\" Bird said in a written statement. \"Iowa stands ready to defend our immigration law that keeps Iowa communities safe.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe Iowa law has increased fear among immigrant communities in the state that enforcement would lead to racial and ethnic profiling, complicate interactions with police or dissuade community members from reporting crime. Activist and advocacy groups, including one named in the suit, have hosted gatherings to try to answer people's questions and organized protests in response.\n\nTexas was allowed to enforce the law for only a few confusing hours in March before it was put on hold by a federal appeals court's three-judge panel. The panel heard arguments by both supporters and opponents in April, and will next issue a decision on the law's constitutionality.\n\nSome law enforcement officials and legal experts have said unanswered questions remain about how the laws in Iowa and Texas would be implemented, since enforcement of immigration law has historically fallen to the federal government and is a binational process.\n\nThe Iowa law, which goes into effect on July 1, would allow criminal charges to be brought against people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously have been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted, potentially facing time in prison before deportation.\n\nThe federal lawsuit states that because the Constitution assigns the task of regulating immigration and managing international borders to federal government, the state law should not be enforced.\n\nThe Iowa lawsuit also contends that the law conflicts with federal law and could direct police to arrest people who are authorized to be in the U.S., such as people who have been granted asylum or have visas. The suit said the law could result in the prosecution of children brought to Iowa by their parents.\n\n\"It will create absolute chaos and human suffering in our legal system, and harm Iowa communities,\" said Melloy Goettel, legal director at the American Immigration Council.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the new legislation into law, reiterated her support for the change.\n\n\"As Governor, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of Iowa,\" Reynolds said in a written statement that repeated the arguments of other Republican leaders. \"Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation's immigration laws -- threatening the safety of our citizens -- Iowa will step in.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The law makes it a crime for a foreign national to enter Iowa after having been deported from the US in the past, regardless of current immigration status.\n\nThe groups involved are the national and state ACLU chapters and the American Immigration Council. They represent the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, advising and advocating for immigrants and refugees.\n\nIn the complaint filed with the District Court of Southern Iowa, the groups claim that Iowa has exceeded its power by intruding on areas of law reserved to the federal government. They first argue that the federal government has exclusive power to regulate immigration and that Iowa's law conflicts with federal immigration statutes. For example, a person commits no federal crime if the person was previously deported and now reenters the US on a visa. But at the same time, they commit a state crime under Iowa law, according to the complaint. Second, the groups contend that the Iowa law intrudes on the federal government's exclusive power to regulate foreign commerce, which includes \"people's entry into the US and their movement across state borders.\"\n\nThe complaint also stresses the law's impact. Forbidden reentry is an \"aggravated misdemeanor, punishable by up to two years in state prison.\" If the person was previously removed for committing a crime, reentry becomes a felony with a maximum sentence of ten years. The law authorizes state judges to order people to leave the US.\n\nThe ACLU announced the lawsuit on its website, stating that the law is \"one of the worst, most far-reaching immigration laws ever passed in the state of Iowa.\" The civil rights group also cautions that the law applies to minors and will \"fuel racial profiling\" and \"result in the separation of families.\"\n\nKim Reynolds, Iowa's Republican Governor, responded with a brief statement, \"As Governor, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of Iowa. Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation's immigration laws - threatening the safety of our citizens - Iowa will step in.\"\n\nJust over a month ago, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction against a similar law in Texas. That law criminalizes crossing the US border into Texas at an unauthorized point. However, a preliminary injunction only stops the law from going into effect while the case is pending, so the court has not yet given a final ruling.\n\nIn the meantime, more states may join Texas and Iowa in their campaign against immigration. For example, Oklahoma's House of Representatives recently passed a law criminalizing both illegal presence in Oklahoma and reentering after deportation.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cornell_law_school@jurist.org", "name": "Cornell Law School", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "gijs_de_bra@jurist.org", "name": "Gijs De Bra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_national", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign national"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racial profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/05/Iowa-State-Capitol.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553987", "eventUri": "eng-9553987", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 158, "textEnd": 164}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 452988092, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 30, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 30}}}

Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division, said in a statement. \"We have brought this action to ensure that Iowa adheres to the framework adopted by Congress and the Constitution for regulation of immigration.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The law is similar to a more expansive Texas statute that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuit was filed on the same day the ACLU of Iowa, national ACLU and the American Immigration Council filed suit to to block the law on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individual Iowans.\n\n\"This ugly law is deeply harmful to Iowa families and communities,\" said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director of The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. \"Iowa lawmakers knowingly targeted people who are protected by federal immigration laws and who are legally allowed to be here.\"\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said Thursday that the state would not back down, and that the law existed because President Joe Biden hasn't secured the southern border.\n\n\"Iowa's law is not unique; it simply enforces immigration laws while Biden refuses to,\" Bird said in a written statement. \"Iowa stands ready to defend our immigration law that keeps Iowa communities safe.\"\n\nThe Iowa law has increased fear among immigrant communities in the state that enforcement would lead to racial and ethnic profiling, complicate interactions with police or dissuade community members from reporting crime. Activist and advocacy groups, including one named in the suit, have hosted gatherings to try to answer people's questions and organized protests in response.\n\nTexas was allowed to enforce the law for only a few confusing hours in March before it was put on hold by a federal appeals court's three-judge panel. The panel heard arguments by both supporters and opponents in April, and will next issue a decision on the law's constitutionality.\n\nSome law enforcement officials and legal experts have said unanswered questions remain about how the laws in Iowa and Texas would be implemented, since enforcement of immigration law has historically fallen to the federal government and is a binational process.\n\nThe Iowa law, which goes into effect on July 1, would allow criminal charges to be brought against people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously have been removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted, potentially facing time in prison before deportation.\n\nThe federal lawsuit states that because the Constitution assigns the task of regulating immigration and managing international borders to federal government, the state law should not be enforced.\n\nThe Iowa lawsuit also contends that the law conflicts with federal law and could direct police to arrest people who are authorized to be in the U.S., such as people who have been granted asylum or have visas. The suit said the law could result in the prosecution of children brought to Iowa by their parents.\n\n\"It will create absolute chaos and human suffering in our legal system, and harm Iowa communities,\" said Melloy Goettel, legal director at the American Immigration Council.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the new legislation into law, reiterated her support for the change.\n\n\"As Governor, I have a responsibility to protect the citizens of Iowa,\" Reynolds said in a written statement that repeated the arguments of other Republican leaders. \"Since President Biden refuses to enforce our nation's immigration laws -- threatening the safety of our citizens -- Iowa will step in.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

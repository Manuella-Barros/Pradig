Reader discretion is advised.\n\nCharles Manson was one of the most notorious serial killers in US history. His crimes came to light in December 1969 when the authorities charged him and his followers for the brutal killings of actress Sharon Tate and her friends. The court found Manson and his followers guilty and given the death penalty. However, in 1972, the state of California abolished the death penalty, and all their sentences were changed to life imprisonment. His crimes and reputation have since made people curious about his personal life and if he had any kids.\n\nAccording to several reports, Charles Manson married twice and shared one child each with his wives. Per Men's Health, Manson married his first wife, Rosalie Jean Willis, in 1955. The following year, the duo welcomed their son Charles Manson Jr. in 1956. The outlet mentioned that the cult leader was in prison during the birth of Manson Jr. However, two years after his birth, the couple divorced. Then, in 1959, the criminal married Leona Ray \"Candy\" Steven, and together they had a son named Charles Luther Manson. However, it was also reported that Manson had a third child as well, but it wasn't with any of his wives.\n\nMen's Health mentioned that Charles Manson had his third child, Valentine Michael Manson, with one of the members of the Manson Family, Mary Brunner.\n\nWhere are Charles Manson's Kids now?\n\nAccording to Newsweek, Manson's first wife, Rosalie Jean Willis, remarried, and Charles Manson Jr. changed his name. The publication reported that he struggled with his connection to the serial killer and killed himself in 1993. Citing the death certificate, Manson's first child died because of a \"self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\" Meanwhile, information about Manson's second child, Charles Luther Manson, remains scarce. Per International Business Times, Luther Manson changed his name to Jay Charles Warner.\n\nValentine Michael Manson is the only child who has talked about himself and Manson openly. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, he claimed that his father never ordered the killings of Sharon Tate and her friends. He said, \"I don't believe that he did. I believe that it was something manufactured after the fact. This 'Helter Skelter' thing, when you look into it deeply, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\" During the interview, the son also revealed that he received a postcard from Manson and wanted to write back. However, it was too late.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aayush_sharma@comingsoon.net", "name": "Aayush Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Men's Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Tate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharon Tate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Brunner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary Brunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helter_Skelter_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helter Skelter (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Business Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Untitled-design-97.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779594", "eventUri": "eng-9779594", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

She had moved to the city to be close to Manson, who for a time had been incarcerated in nearby Folsom for the home-invasion murders in Los Angeles that made him infamous.\n\nFromme did not appear to harbor any specific animus toward President Ford, but he represented an establishment she and the Manson clan despised. She had been distributing apocalyptic news releases. That summer, speaking to the Associated Press, she promised carnage while invoking two of Manson's crime scenes and a massacre in Vietnam.\n\n\"If Nixon's reality -- wearing a new Ford face -- continues to run the country against the law, our homes will be bloodier than the Tate-LaBianca houses and My Lai put together,\" she said.\n\nThen, as now, the Secret Service had a long list of people who posed a potential threat to the president. Despite her menacing rhetoric, Fromme's name did not make the list.\n\nShe was waiting quietly near an orange tree in Capitol Park around 10 a.m. on Sept. 5, wearing a hand-sewn Red Riding Hood-style cloak that was supposed to symbolize a newly ascetic lifestyle of sacrifice and activism. On her leg, beneath her dress, was a jury-rigged holster with a borrowed .45 handgun that had been developed for the military.\n\nHaving just spoken to a group of business leaders at breakfast, Ford left the Senator Hotel and crossed the street to the park. He was going to see Gov. Jerry Brown at his office, a walk of maybe 150 yards. Hundreds of people had gathered to catch a glimpse of him and shake his hand.\n\nKaren Skelton, then 14, had ditched school for a look at the president. She recalls the crowd was three or four people deep, and Fromme was a few feet ahead of her, to the right.\n\n\"I thought she was a little odd, because she was in this red robe,\" Skelton told The Times in a recent interview. \"At one point she sort of looked around and looked up, and said, 'Oh, what a beautiful day.'\"\n\nThe president had opted against traveling to the Capitol in his armored car, and Larry Buendorf, a 37-year-old Secret Service agent, was part of the security detail accompanying him on foot.\n\n\"Rather than a motorcade, he said, 'I think I'll just walk,'\" Buendorf recalled this month. \"It was unplanned, so everybody hustled to get things in place as best we could. A lot of people lined up along the sidewalk. He was just walking along, shaking hands. I was right at his shoulder, to make sure nobody held on too long and make sure nobody took his watch. My concentration was on the hands that were reaching out to him.\"\n\nRead more: Wild claims of mass child molestation rocked an L.A. beach town. Truth was the first casualty\n\nThat is when he saw the .45 in Fromme's hand, pointed at the president. He stepped in front of Ford and grabbed the gun. Ford was hustled to safety, Fromme thrown up against a tree and handcuffed. Witnesses heard her exclaiming, \"It didn't go off\" and \"He's not a public servant.\"\n\nSomehow, Buendorf's hand was cut. He's not sure exactly how.\n\nInvestigators would find no bullet in the gun's chamber, but four in the clip.\n\n\"You pull the slide back, and it chambers a round. If she had had one in the chamber already, I don't think I would have made it. I think it would have gone through me and the president,\" Buendorf said.\n\nReporters converged on the apartment where Fromme had been living with another Manson disciple, Sandy Good, who warned of a group called the International People's Court of Retribution, which would, she said, bring death to corporate leaders and politicians.\n\n\"A wave of assassins, thousands of people, will be moving through bedrooms with butcher knives,\" she said. \"Those people who are killing our earth deserve to die.\"\n\nInvestigators found no evidence of a broader conspiracy to kill Ford, and no proof that the incarcerated Manson had given the order.\n\nStill, Stephen Kay, a former Manson prosecutor, has long suspected Manson put her up to it as a way to win further notoriety, maybe passing word to her through an intermediary.\n\n\"There's no way that Squeaky thought that up for herself,\" he told The Times, describing her as a \"space cadet.\"\n\n\"Manson loved to be in the news himself or have the family in the news,\" he added.\n\nRaised in an upper-middle-class home in Redondo Beach, the daughter of an aeronautical engineer, Fromme was kicked out of her house as a teenager and met Manson on Venice Beach in 1967. He called himself \"the Gardener,\" the caretaker of lost flower children. Of the forces that influenced her, Fromme wrote in her memoir \"Reflexion,\" \"Charlie and LSD stand out.\"\n\nIn \"Helter Skelter,\" his account of the Manson murders, prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi wrote that Fromme wore a perpetual smile, possessed a \"little-girl quality\" and seemed to radiate an \"inner contentment\" that reminded him of a religious fanatic. \"Charlie is love\" was her doctrine. At the Spahn Ranch near Chatsworth, Manson assigned Fromme to take care of the blind, elderly owner, who was allowing the Manson clan to stay on his property, and by Bugliosi's account, enjoyed the sexual attentions of the female disciples.\n\nThe family leader in Manson's absence, she helped embroider an elaborate ceremonial vest for him, weaving in her own red locks. In the 1973 documentary \"Manson,\" Fromme posed with rifles and daggers, declared that Manson was God, and said she was ready to die for him.\n\n\"Anybody can kill anyone,\" she said.\n\nManson did not command Fromme to accompany the band of killers responsible for the Tate-LaBianca murders in August 1969, but during their trial, she kept vigil outside the Hall of Justice in downtown Los Angeles and carved an X in her forehead in solidarity.\n\n\"After court, I was on my way to the parking lot and Squeaky and Sandy snuck up behind me, and they said they were going to do to my house what was done at the Tate house,\" said Kay, the former prosecutor. \"And we all know what was done at the Tate house.\"\n\nWhen Fromme was arraigned on a charge of attempting to kill Ford, she demanded the federal judge put a halt to logging.\n\n\"The important part is the redwood trees,\" Fromme said. \"We want to save them. Do you understand this is like cutting down your own arms and legs?\" She added, \"The gun is pointed, and whether it goes off is up to you all.\"\n\nAt trial, she asked that Manson be brought to court to testify. The judge refused. At one point, she threw an apple at a prosecutor. In an effort to show that she never meant to fire the .45, the defense established that she had taken shooting lessons at a firing range and knew her way around firearms.\n\n\"The government was very concerned about the possibility of an assault conviction instead of an attempted murder conviction, because there was evidence she was very familiar with guns,\" said journalist Jess Bravin, author of \"Squeaky: The Life and Times of Lynette Alice Fromme.\"\n\nShe was found guilty of trying to kill Ford and received a life sentence. In 1987, after hearing a rumor that Manson was dying of cancer, she slipped away from a minimum-security federal prison in West Virginia with the hope, she said, of being near him. She was captured two miles away. She was paroled, at age 60, in 2009.\n\nBravin said that when he interviewed Fromme, who maintained a kind of religious devotion to Manson until his death, she told him she had gone to the park that day uncertain about what she would do.\n\n\"She had no personal feelings about [Ford] one way or another,\" Bravin said. \"She was very angry at the system and what she felt was the environmental degradation. Ford was coming to speak to businessmen in Sacramento. She felt he was destroying the redwoods.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_goffard@yahoo.com", "name": "Christopher Goffard",

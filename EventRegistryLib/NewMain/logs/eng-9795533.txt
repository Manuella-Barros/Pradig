The Disney+/Hulu/Max bundle and the ad-free Disney+/Hulu Premium bundle will keep their current prices. To offset the price hikes, Disney+ will introduce new features like continuous playlists, ABC News Live, and a preschool playlist starting September 4, with more updates coming later in the year.\n\nThe streaming world has gotten a lot more competitive and expensive recently. Many of our beloved streaming platforms are battling for the top spot, making it more expensive to stay in the game. Netflix has been tweaking its prices constantly since it started, showing just how much things have changed. Disney, jumping deeper into streaming, has also been bumping up prices for its subscriptions. Even with the option to watch ads, we're still seeing costs go up. If you thought Disney+ wouldn't get another price hike this year, think again. Starting this fall, Disney is raising prices for all stand-alone tiers of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ in the US, along with most of its bundles.\n\nBeginning October 17, the ad-supported tier will jump by $2 to $10 per month, while the ad-free tier will also increase by $2, reaching $16 per month, according to The Verge. This means subscribers have a short time to enjoy the current rates for Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu before the changes kick in. After that, they'll need to decide whether to stick with the higher prices or cancel their subscriptions.\n\nRelated How to cancel your Disney Plus subscription\n\nIt's time to bid farewell to your Disney+ subscription\n\nDisney aims to boost its streaming revenue and profitability with these price hikes. Interestingly, the new Disney+/Hulu/Max bundle will keep its current price. Likewise, the ad-free Disney+/Hulu Premium bundle will stay at $20 per month. Here's a breakdown of the specific price changes (via Variety and The Verge):\n\nService\n\nPrevious monthly price\n\nNew monthly price\n\nNew annual price\n\nDisney+ Basic (With Ads)\n\n$7.99\n\n$9.99\n\nN/A\n\nDisney+ Premium (No Ads)\n\n$13.99\n\n$15.99\n\n$159.99\n\nHulu With Ads\n\n$7.99\n\n$9.99\n\n$99.99\n\nHulu With No Ads\n\n$17.99\n\n$18.99\n\nN/A\n\nESPN+\n\n$10.99\n\n$11.99\n\n$119.99\n\nDuo Basic (Disney+, Hulu with ads)\n\n$9.99\n\n$10.99\n\nN/A\n\nDuo Premium (Disney+, Hulu without ads)\n\n$19.99\n\n$19.99\n\nN/A\n\nBundle Trio Basic (Disney+ and Hulu with ads, ESPN+)\n\n$14.99\n\n$16.99\n\nBundle Trio Premium (Disney+ and Hulu without ads, ESPN+)\n\n$24.99\n\n$26.99\n\nHulu + Live TV (With SVOD Ads)\n\n$76.99\n\n$82.99\n\nN/A\n\nHulu + Live TV (No SVOD Ads)\n\n$89.99\n\n$95.99\n\nN/A\n\nDisney is pushing the Disney Bundle as a cheaper option\n\nThese price changes seem strategically aimed at steering consumers toward the Disney Bundle. For just $11 per month, slightly more than the cost of a single service, Disney offers the ad-supported tiers of Disney+ and Hulu, making the bundle a more budget-friendly choice.\n\nTo balance out the upcoming price hikes, Disney+ is adding new features starting September 4. US subscribers will get continuous playlists, including ABC News Live and a special preschool content playlist. This addition will build on the existing library, with four more curated playlists coming later in the fall. Disney is focusing on boosting value by offering more live and on-demand content, with even more updates planned for the rest of the year.", "source": {"uri": "androidpolice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Police"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/08/disney-plus-ap-hero-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795533", "eventUri": "eng-9795533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 382, "textEnd": 393, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 1137, "textEnd": 1147}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

And it will happen again in the fall of 2024. Disney has officially announced that Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ will be more expensive starting on October 17.\n\nDisney+ was $6.99 per month when it launched in late 2019. But now, Disney+ with ads will be $9.99 per month, a $2 increase over the previous price. The ad-free Disney+ tier will also go up $2 to $15.99. Similarly, Hulu with ads is rising to $9.99 a month, while the ad-free option is only going up by a buck to $18.99.

At the same time, the Mouse House is leaving the prices of its Disney+/Hulu bundles unchanged, along with the recently introduced Disney+/Hulu/Max combo offered in partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery -- making them look even more attractive to consumers relative to the pricier stand-alone versions.\n\nDisney, in announcing the price hikes Tuesday, said that beginning Sept. 4, Disney+ subscribers will have access to the ABC News Live streaming channel and a playlist focused on preschool content. Disney+ Premium (no ads) subs will have access to four additional curated playlists later in the fall.\n\n\"With this growing offering, and new ways to enjoy your favorite Disney+ content, Disney subscription plans remain among the best values in streaming today,\" the company said in announcing the price hikes.\n\nThe announcement of the playlist features and addition of ABC News Live seems intended to try to soften the blow of the across-the-board price hikes for the streaming packages. The ad-supported version of Disney+ is rising $2 monthly, to $9.99; Disney+ Premium (no ads) is also going up by two bucks, to $15.99. Hulu with ads will now cost $9.99/month (up $2) and the ad-free Hulu is going up a dollar, to $18.99/month.\n\nAlso increasing by $2 per month are the Disney triple-play bundles with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. (A chart with the company's updated streaming pricing is below.) In the U.S., Disney last raised rates for the ad-free tiers of Disney+ and Hulu, as well as ESPN+, in October 2023.\n\nDisney's pricing for the \"Duo Basic\" bundle (Disney+ and Hulu with ads) will still be $10.99/month and \"Duo Premium\" (Disney+ and Hulu ad-free) will remain $19.99/month. The Disney+/Hulu/Max package will remain $16.99/month with ads and $29.99/month without ads.\n\nThe new pricing for Disney's streaming services is as follows:\n\nNext month, Disney+ will launch a playlist focused on preschool content featuring TV series and shorts available on the service including \"Sofia the First,\" \"The Lion Guard,\" \"Puppy Dog Pals\" and \"Minnie's Bow-Toons.\" Later this fall, four additional curated playlists will initially roll out to Premium subscribers, featuring Disney+ content that will be refreshed monthly: Seasonal Content (a collection of seasonal-themed content from across the Disney+ catalog); Epic Stories (a compilation of stories from brands and franchises including Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars); Throwbacks (with nostalgic pop culture content); and Real Life (featuring traditional documentaries, biopics and true stories).\n\n\"Playlists are the latest example of how we're providing the best value and experience for our subscribers every time they open Disney+,\" said Alisa Bowen, president of Disney+. \"Whether its news, kids' content, popular genres, hit TV shows or blockbuster films, there will be something for everyone in a lean-back viewing experience based on seasonality and interest.\"\n\nDisney is scheduled to report earnings for the June quarter, its Q3 of fiscal 2024, on Wednesday, Aug. 7, before market open.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Disney's streaming portfolio -- including Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus -- will cost more starting in October. While no one likes to see their subscriptions go up, they are some of the best streaming services, so at least the cost is somewhat justified.\n\nDisney is rolling out the price increases on October 17, according to Variety. So, you have a couple more months to enjoy the current Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu prices. From there, it'll be up to you to decide whether to cancel the services or pay the extra money each month.\n\nA $2 price hike will go into effect for the monthly and annual ad-supported plans for the standalone services, as well as the triple-play bundle with Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus. Ad-free Hulu and the ad-supported Disney Plus/Hulu duo bundle are going up by $1.\n\nThe Disney Plus/Hulu Premium no-ads plan will stay at $19.99 per month. And the newly announced Max, Hulu and Disney Plus bundles will retain the same prices of $16.99 (with ads) and $29.99 (ad-free).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the new prices compared to the previous cost:\n\nThe Hulu + Live TV plans see the most significant increases at $6, but every service except the Disney Duo Premium is going up by at least $1. Several popular plans, such as Disney Plus plans, are increasing by $2.\n\nDisney's latest price increase does come with a bit of added value. Beginning Sept. 4, Disney Plus will offer access to an ABC News Live channel and a playlist focused on preschool content. Whether those interest you is a matter of preference, but at the least, the price increase does come with some extra content.\n\n\"Playlists are the latest example of how we're providing the best value and experience for our subscribers every time they open Disney Plus,\" said Alisa Bowen, president of Disney+. \"Whether it's news, kids' content, popular genres, hit TV shows or blockbuster films, there will be something for everyone in a lean-back viewing experience based on seasonality and interest.\"\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how this price hike affects Disney's long-term subscriber numbers and its many streaming options. Streaming is an important part of the company's future, and it seems like bundles are the main focus. They're meant to act as a bulwark against churn (the cycle of subscribers canceling and then signing up again later). Yet, streaming bundles are taking us right back to the days of cable TV, when you were saddled with a package containing channels you didn't want.\n\n\"With this growing offering, and new ways to enjoy your favorite Disney Plus content, Disney subscription plans remain among the best values in streaming today,\" the company said in an official announcement.

Disney announced today that they are hiking prices across the board for Disney+ and Hulu, with both the ad-supported and ad-free tiers of Disney+ rising $2 monthly, to $9.99 and $15.99, respectively. Over on the Hulu side , the ad-supported tier will now cost $9.99/month (up $2) and ad-free Hulu is going up a dollar to $18.99/month.\n\nInterestingly, Disney's pricing for their Duo Basic and Duo Premium bundles (which include Disney+ and Hulu with ads) will still be $10.99 and $19.99/month, respectively. However, if you spring for the Trio Basic or Premium bundle with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, you can expect a $2 increase, raising the price of these offerings to $16.99 and $26.99, respectively\n\nThese new prices will take effect October 17, which means users have about two months to cancel or change their plan if they don't want to get hit by higher costs.\n\nDisney+\n\nSubscription with ads $7.99\n\nPremium Subscription $13.99\n\nSimultaneous streams 4\n\n# of profiles 7\n\nOriginals Yes\n\nLive TV No\n\nLibrary\n\nDisney+\n\nExpand\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nRelated\n\nHow to cancel Disney+\n\nYou can only watch so much Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars.\n\nHow to save money on Disney+ and Hulu\n\nCheck with your cell phone company first\n\nPixar/Disney\n\nDisney+, Hulu and Max streaming bundle\n\nSubscription with ads Yes\n\nPremium Subscription Yes\n\nLive TV No\n\nPrice $16.99-$29.99\n\nFree trial No\n\nDisney+, Hulu and Max (Ad-Supported)Disney+, Hulu and Max (No Ads)\n\nThough streamers are likely reeling from sticker shock after Disney+ and Hulu's latest round of price hikes, there are some deals to be had.

Regarding the price increase, the company said, \"With this growing offering and new ways to enjoy your favorite Disney+ content, Disney subscription plans remain among the best values in streaming today.\" See the full breakdown in prices below.\n\nService\n\nNew Price\n\nPrevious Price\n\nPrince Increase\n\nDisney+ Basic (with Ads)\n\n$9.99\n\n$7.99\n\n$2\n\nDisney+ Premium (no Ads)\n\n$15.99\n\n$13.99\n\n$2\n\nHulu with Ads\n\n$9.99\n\n$7.99\n\n$2\n\nHulu without Ads\n\n$18.99\n\n$17.99\n\n$1\n\nESPN+\n\n$11.99\n\n$10.99\n\n$1\n\nDisney Duo Basic (Disney+ & Hulu with ads)\n\n$10.99\n\n$9.99\n\n$1\n\nDisney Duo Premium (Disney+ & Hulu with no ads)\n\n$19.99\n\n$19.99\n\nNo Change\n\nDisney Bundle Trio Basic (Disney+ and Hulu with ads, ESPN+)\n\n$16.99\n\n$14.99\n\n$2\n\nDisney Bundle Trio Premium (Disney+ and Hulu with no ads, ESPN+)\n\n$26.99\n\n$24.99\n\n$2\n\nHulu + Live TV (With SVOD Ads)\n\n$82.99\n\n$76.99\n\n$6\n\nHulu + Live TV (No SVOD Ads)\n\n$95.99\n\n$89.99\n\n$6\n\nStreaming Inflation Close\n\nSummer 2024 has seen many trends, including streaming inflation. In late December 2023, heading into the new year, Prime Video announced customers would have to pay extra to skip ads. In June 2024, Max announced it was raising the price of its ad-free service from $15.99 to $16.99. Ahead of its 2024 Summer Olympic coverage, Peacock raised prices in July 2024. Paramount+'s $1 price increase will go into effect in August 2024. Netflix, has been the worst offender as the streaming service has increased its subscription fees once a year since the onset of the pandemic, with the company recently announcing it was canceling its lowest-priced ad-free subscription plan of $11.9, with the cheapest ad-free versions being the $15.49 monthly standard HD video quality plan and a $22.99 premium Ultra HD plan.\n\nDisney+ is the latest streaming service to raise its prices, and this comes amid a wave of frustration among consumers, not only because of rising inflation. When Disney+ first launched in 2019, the original plan with no ads was $6.99. That means that in the five years since it launched, that basic service has climbed $9. Yet, it is cheaper than Max and a better deal than Netflix's Ultra HD plan, as they make you pay more for a feature with Disney+. Disney has been criticized heavily for increasing the prices on many of its services, particularly in the theme parks, as the infamous Genie+ service that put the previously free Fast Pass system behind a paywall was recently canceled.\n\nRelated Warner Bros. Discovery Shutting Down Iconic Streaming Platform in September\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery has shared details with subscribers via an email announcement.\n\n5\n\nWhile the idea is that these companies need to continue to grow in profit, at some point, a limit will come, and as more people become more careful about their spending, the streaming services they subscribe to will come into question. Disney+ certainly has a firm hold on the public because they have beloved brands like Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, and the classic Disney library that make them a must-have for families, while Hulu offers many of the most critically acclaimed television series on the air. Yet the fact that there are bundles of these services, including with competitors like Warner Bros. Discovery's Max, shows that the world is seemingly moving back to the cable model of bundling platforms - an approach streaming was believed to have killed in the 2010s.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultra-high-definition television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

After most recently jacking up streaming prices in October 2023, The Walt Disney Company is raising subscription fees by as much as 25 percent, depending on the streaming service and plan.\n\nHere's how pricing will look in October compared to now:\n\nNow As of October 17 Disney+ with ads $8/month $10/month Disney+ without ads $14/month\n\n$140/year $16/month\n\n$160/year Hulu with ads $8/year\n\n$80/year $10/month\n\n$100/year Hulu without ads $18/month $19/month Hulu and Live TV with ads $77/month $83/month Hulu and Live TV without ads $90/month $96/month Disney+ and Hulu with ads $10/month $11/month Disney+ and Hulu without ads $20/month No change ESPN+ $11/month\n\n$110/year $12/month\n\n$120/year Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ with ads $15 No change Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ without ads $25 No change\n\nDisney didn't announce any pricing changes for the bundle that contains Disney+, sister streaming service Hulu, and Warner Bros. Discovery's rival streaming platform, Max.\n\nBased on the updated pricing, Disney is seemingly trying to coax people to sign up for one of its streaming bundles, which combine multiple services for a lower price than if the services were each subscribed to individually. Streaming companies have been trying to use bundles to deter people from frequently canceling their streaming subscriptions. But as we've written before, streaming bundles don't address subscribers' complaints around incessant price hikes, content quality, confusing packages, or features.\n\nAnother price hike\n\nOne of the biggest problems that streaming subscribers, especially long-term ones, are facing is ever-rising prices. Disney already increased prices in October 2023, meaning Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ are facing their second price hikes in about a year.\n\nEarly reactions online, including on forums like Reddit, show people dissatisfied with streaming price hikes that don't seem to align with the quality of content available. For example, Reddit user Montysucker wrote: \"easy[,] cancel now,\" adding:\n\n\"The enshittification of media in the last few years is insane and it's wild how seemingly no one cares anymore about making something that is actually enjoyable to watch and not their egotistic[al] pipe dream.\"\n\nOf course, many expressed being overwhelmed with continuing to see streaming prices rise, as Slow_Investment_2211 wrote:\n\nSo glad I dumped most of my streaming services. So tired of this price increase shit.\n\nOn October 12, 2023, as Variety summarized, Disney+ without ads went up by 27 percent, from $11 to $14 per month. Hulu without ads went up 20 percent ($15 to $18/month). Hulu with Live packages each also increased by $7 at the time, while ESPN+ pricing increased by $1.\n\nDisney paired the price hike announcement with the revealing of new upcoming features for Disney+. However, the new linear channels are little comfort for people who don't use Disney+.\n\nThe new channels will be ABC News Live, which Disney+ users can access on September 4, and channels \"focused on preschool content, featuring TV series and shorts available on Disney+.\" Disney+ will also get four more channels (or as Disney's calling them, playlists) that show: 1) \"Seasonal Content\" from Disney+; 2) \"Epic Stories\" from big franchises like Marvel and Star Wars; 3) \"Throwbacks\" with \"nostalgic pop culture\"; and 4) \"Real Life\" documentaries.\n\nIt's possible that Disney will introduce more channels to appeal to more users. But with all the price hikes that streaming subscribers have endured over the past few years, many would prefer avoiding price bumps that are partially for extra channels that they may never watch. Charging for unwanted content in media packages that are already priced questionably is reminiscent of cable, something that streaming was initially supposed to replace, not replicate.\n\nSubscribers to Disney's trio of streaming services will be unlikely to be alone in facing price hikes for long; analysts suspect Netflix pricing will also increase this year.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scharon_harding@arstechnica.com", "name": "Scharon Harding", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

These latest price increases for Disney+ and Hulu seem designed to incentivize consumers to switch to the Disney+ and Hulu ad-supported bundle (also known as The Disney Bundle). And while that might be the case, seeing the millionth price hike is probably incredibly tiring for consumers. It was just this time last year that Disney announced its last series of price hikes. But last time, price increases only impacted ad-free tiers. This time, no tier is safe. Will streaming prices ever stop rising? It doesn't seem likely. But how much is the cost of Disney+, Hulu, and more changing this time around? Here's the breakdown.\n\nHere's where we stand on the price increase front. Disney+'s ad-supported tier will increase by $2 a month; it will go from $7.99 a month to $9.99 a month. Disney+'s ad-free tier will also increase by $2 a month, going from $13.99 to $15.99.\n\nOn the Hulu front, Hulu's ad-supported tier will also go from $7.99 to $9.99 per month, increasing my $2. Hulu's ad-free plan will increase in cost by $1 per month, going from $17.99 per month to $18.99 per month.\n\nThe Disney Bundle Basic Duo, which features Disney+ and Hulu's ad-supported tiers, will increase by $1 per month and cost $10.99 per month. After this last increase, Disney+ will cost $9.99 per month, so paying one more dollar for an additional streamer now feels sensible. Of course, the shifting streaming prices have been designed to make it so. It seems streamers want to push their consumers to ad-supported options now more than ever.\n\nThe only plan that will not see an increase in price is The Disney Bundle Duo Premium or ad-free option. It will remain $19.99.\n\nThe Disney Bundle \"trio\" option will also increase in price. The trio includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Consumers will see a price hike of $2 on both the basic and premium versions of the plan; they'll land at $16.99 and $26.99 a month, respectively.\n\nESPN+ will also see a $1 price increase, going from $10.99 per month to $11.99 per month. Hulu with Live TV will see a $6 price hike per month, landing it at $82.99 (phew) for the version that includes ad-supported tiers of Disney+ and Hulu and $95.99 (phew!) for the version with ad-free tiers.\n\nThese latest price increases for Disney+, Hulu, and more will begin on October 17.\n\nTo help account for these price hikes, Disney is adding a new feature: continuous playlists. The playlists function basically like TV channels. They play continuous offerings that a user can simply tune into without having to make decisions about what exactly to watch. First up are two continuous playlists, one for ABC News Live and one for preschool content.\n\nDisney+'s president Alisa Bowen shares, \"Playlists are the latest example of how we're providing the best value and experience for our subscribers every time they open Disney+. Whether it's news, kids' content, popular genres, hit TV shows, or blockbuster films, there will be something for everyone in a lean-back viewing experience based on seasonality and interest.\"\n\nThe first two channels mentioned above will go live on September 4. Later in the fall, four more playlists will join them, and these will be refreshed monthly. They include playlists for seasonal content, retro and nostalgic throwbacks, real-life programming that involves documentaries, biopics, and more, and \"epic stories\" from Star Wars, Disney, and Marvel IP. These will only be available for Premium subscribers.", "source": {"uri": "nerdist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerdist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://legendary-digital-network-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/02101348/Deadpool-and-Wolverine-Wade-surprised.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795533", "eventUri": "eng-9795533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 2398, "textEnd": 2408}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 3200, "textEnd": 3211}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

However, Disney Plus is not the only platform the company is raising prices on.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Disney announced a price hike is coming for Disney Plus. The basic and premium plans for this platform will go up to $9.99 and $15.99, respectively.\n\nFor some time, Disney has allowed customers to bundle its streaming services. The option that includes Disney Plus and Hulu with ads is getting a price bump up to $10.99. However, the same bundle without ads is staying the same at $19.99 per month.\n\nOn top of that, expect price increases for both Hulu and ESPN Plus as well. Hulu's ad-supported plan will now be $9.99, while the ad-free tier will cost $18.99. Meanwhile, ESPN Plus, which includes ads, will now cost $11.99.\n\nThese price increases are scheduled to go into effect on October 17. While this is far from welcomed news, Disney is giving something back in return. Disney Plus will be gaining some new channels that stream continuously.

Hulu with ads will similarly jump to $9.99 from $7.99, while the ad-free version will go up to $18.99 from $14.99. ESPN+ with ads will cost $11.99 a month, up from $10.99. Disney last raised prices in the U.S. in October 2023.\n\nThe announcement comes a day before Disney is slated to release its fiscal 2024 third-quarter results before the opening bell on Wednesday. Shares rose 2.5% Tuesday.\n\nDisney, like competitors Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) and Paramount (PARA), has recently been under pressure to make its streaming endeavors profitable after spending huge sums to catch industry leader Netflix (NFLX).\n\nDisney earlier this year took a page out of streaming leader Netflix's playbook and vowed to crack down on password sharing in June.\n\nDisney surprised Wall Street by nearly reaching profitability in its fiscal second quarter when a loss at ESPN+ slightly offset a small profit at Disney+ and Hulu. It attributed the improved results to higher prices, subscriber growth, and lower distribution costs. At the time, it forecast its streaming division would be profitable in the fourth quarter.\n\nDisney has lately nudged subscribers toward bundles by offering steep discounts, and that will still be true after the price hikes.\n\nCase in point, Hulu with ads and Disney+ will increase $1 to $10.99 a month, just $1 more than ad-supported Disney+ alone. The ad-free version isn't increasing in price at all, sticking at $19.99.\n\nStreamers like bundling because it tends to reduce churn and lower subscriber acquisition costs. They have embraced the practice even though it means collaborating with competitors.\n\nIn July, Disney launched a partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery to bundle Disney+ and Hulu with Max for $16.99 a month with ads and $29.99 without. Like the Hulu/Disney+ ad-free bundle, October's price hikes will not apply to this offering.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The new ad-free tier of Disney+ will soon cost $16 a month. It comes as Disney and other companies continue to try and squeeze more profit out of expensive-to-run streaming services and before some recent hits, like Inside Out 2, arrive at home this fall.\n\nLaunched in 2019, Disney+ was the company's answer to Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. The service launched with all of The Simpsons, Star Wars, and most Marvel movies, as well as a large collection of classic Disney films, shows, and animated shorts. In the five years since it started, Disney+ has grown more and more, as Disney has added Hulu shows, more original content, Fox-owned properties, and licensed shows like Doctor Who to the service.\n\nBut all that content doesn't come cheap and over the last few years, the price of Disney+ has increased almost every year. And that's happening again this fall.\n\nStarting on October 17, Disney confirmed that most of its streaming plans including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ will cost around $1 to $2 more a month. Hulu's most pricey plan, which includes live TV, will cost $6 more a month.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney+ basic (which has ads) and Disney+ premium (which is ad-free) are jumping up to $10 and $16 respectively. That means an ad-free Disney+ subscription will cost twice what it did in 2019 at launch, when Disney offered just one plan with no ads for $7 a month.\n\nHulu with ads is going up to $10 a month and without ads it hops up to $19. Finally, ESPN+ will cost $12 a month starting in October. Disney is also adding \"Playlists\" which will be always-on channels within the app streaming content like news, old movies, and TV shows. It will work a lot like how Pluto TV and other FAST (free ad-supported TV) services work.\n\nYes, Disney and other streaming services are basically reinventing channel surfing and cable, but locking it up behind multiple prices, plans, and services. Yes, the future sucks.\n\nThe timing of the price hike doesn't seem random, either, as some recent Disney wins at the box office -- like Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine -- are likely to arrive on the service in the next few months and the House of Mouse is probably wanting to make sure it can capitalize on those recent successes by squeezing folks for a few more dollars to rewatch some popular movies.", "source": {"uri": "kotaku.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kotaku"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Simpsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Television_Stations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Television Stations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_licensing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brand licensing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House of Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pluto TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/618dd19aa20bca25f53759e7346666d3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795533", "eventUri": "eng-9795533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 1029, "textEnd": 1039}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Companies have started to rethink their strategies around streaming services, putting more importance on turning a profit instead of boasting about having a lot of subscribers. Disney raised the prices of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ last year, and will be doing it again this fall, according to Deadline. However, the increase in pricing will come with more content, such as the addition of live playlists dedicated to the news and preschoolers, which should make parents very happy. The majority of subscription tiers will see their pricing increase as of October 17th.\n\nThe announcement of raised pricing for Disney+ and Hulu comes a day before Disney's earning call for Q2. Most will only go up $1 or $2 in price, save for Hulu + Live TV. The new playlists coming in the future are ABC News Live (for the 2024 Presidential Election) and a preschool list consisting of TV series and shorts such as Sofia the First, The Lion Guard, Puppy Dog Pals, and Minnie's Bow-Toons. Premium subscribers will have four additional curated lists pop up in the fall. The playlists will be curated monthly and include Seasonal Content; Epic Stories from brands and franchises including Disney, Marvel and Star Wars; Throwbacks - a destination for nostalgic pop culture content; and Real Life - a lineup of traditional documentaries, biopics, and true stories.\n\n\"Playlists are the latest example of how we're providing the best value and experience for our subscribers every time they open Disney+,\" said Disney+ President Alisa Bowen. \"Whether it's news, kids' content, popular genres, hit TV shows or blockbuster films, there will be something for everyone in a lean-back viewing experience based on seasonality and interest.\"\n\nWhat are the new pricing tiers for Disney+ and Hulu?

As usual, the price bumps are relatively small, but they add up, especially for folks who once believed that cutting the cable cord would also cut costs.\n\nThe price increases run across nearly the entire spectrum and apply to both the ad-free and ad-supported versions of standalone Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ plans, as well as most of Disney's own bundles that include those services, although the Disney-Max bundle seems to have been spared for now, likely because it was just announced and is a partnership that includes Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nSpecifically, the standalone Disney+ plans will increase by $2 each, with the ad-supported one hitting $9.99 monthly and the ad-free version going up to $15.99 monthly. Hulu with ads gets the same $2 price increase to $9.99, while the ad-free Hulu and ESPN+ are only going up by a buck to $18.99 and $11.99, respectively.\n\nIn light of those increases, Disney Duo Basic, which bundles the ad-supported versions of Disney+ and Hulu, becomes an even better deal since it's also only increasing by $1 to $10.99 -- a bump that seems necessary only to keep it from being the same price as the two individual now are on their own. Meanwhile, Disney Duo Premium, which bundles the ad-free versions, remains at $19.99, meaning Hulu ad-free subscribers can tack on Disney+ for only a dollar more.\n\nThe pricing changes will take effect on Thursday, October 17. Here's the full rundown of the increases:\n\nDisney snuck the increases into an announcement focusing on new features, presumably hoping to soften the blow.

To keep the momentum going, Disney is once again raising prices across Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu.\n\nThe ad-supported Disney+ Basic option, available since December 2022, was already disappointingly expensive at $8/month but will now jump to $10. Meanwhile, the ad-free Disney+ Premium will increase from $14/month to $16. Not good. The monthly subscription price of Disney Plus with ads will jump from $8 to $10, while the ad-free tier will increase from $14/month to $16. On a yearly basis, it means coughing up an extra $20 because the annual Disney+ Premium subscription will jump from $140 to $160. To make up for the price increase, the company will throw ABC News Live and thematic playlists comprising content from across its vast properties beginning September 4. The playlists will cover such categories as Preschool, Seasonal, Epic Stories, Throwbacks, and Real Life.\n\nNext up is Hulu. The price of the ad-supported plan will jump from $8/month to $10 and from $80/year to $100/year. Are you nervous already? The privilege of streaming Hulu without advertisements will cost you $19/month instead of $18. Finally, ESPN+ will increase to $12/month and $120/year instead of 11/month and $110/year. Those who subscribe to Disney's basic and premium streaming bundles will soon be paying more, too.\n\nIn July, Disney and Warner Bros. created a mega-streaming bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and Max all included and available with or without ads. On top of that, the company's leadership has two more streaming services in the works. One will bring you live content from major sports leagues like the NFL, NBA, NHL, PGA Tour, Grand Slam Tennis, US Soccer, college football, and NASCAR, thanks to a joint venture between ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery. The other is ESPN, which will get its own streaming service in Fall 2025.\n\nStreaming services have been jacking up prices since the pandemic, to the point where streaming is the new cable in terms of cost. More than anything, these price increases have underscored the importance of keeping streaming subscription spending under control.\n\nSource: The Verge", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foxtel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Disney has confirmed a price increase that will go into effect in October. With this, the company continues the process of making its large investments profitable. While Disney Plus prices will increase, there are a couple of new features to try to justify it. Recently, the company partnered with Warner Bros. to launch an attractive Disney+, Hulu, and Max bundle.\n\nThe Disney Plus project was born in 2019 with high expectations. However, the company barely made its first profit during Q2 2024. The new price increase on Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and Hulu subscriptions seems to be a move that seeks to continue on this path. That said, subscribers probably won't be very happy with the announcement.\n\nStarting with the Disney Plus plan with ads, the monthly fee will go from $8 to $10. On the other hand, the ad-free plan will increase from $14 to $16. Regarding the Disney Plus' annual plan, it will cost $160 (previously $140). As for Hulu, the monthly fee for the ad-supported plan will increase from $8 to $10, while the ad-free plan will cost $19 (previously $18). Hulu's annual plan will also be affected, increasing from $80 to $100.\n\nFor sports fans, ESPN's monthly plan will increase from $11 to $12, while the annual plan will cost $120 (previously $110). Disney's basic and premium streaming bundle subscribers can also expect a small increase in October. That said, Disney Plus subscriptions will include ABC News Live as a new perk. Additionally, the company will launch themed playlists with hand-picked content.\n\nThe new playlists will be divided into categories to help find content sets easily. Disney Plus will first get a \"Preschool\" category with content suitable for the little ones. In the coming months, the service will receive the \"Seasonal,\" \"Epic Stories\" (Marvel and Star Wars primarily), \"Throwbacks\" (for retro content), and \"Real Life\" (documentaries) categories.\n\nThe company previously stated its intentions to make Disney Plus profitable this year. In an official statement, Disney said it expects the service to become \"profitable in the fourth quarter (2024).\" They also aim for \"further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025.\" Only time will tell if making Disney Plus, ESPN, and Hulu subscriptions more expensive helps them achieve that goal or if it ends up being counterproductive.", "source": {"uri": "androidheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jean_leon@androidheadlines.com", "name": "Jean Leon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foxtel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_television_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Children's television series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Disney-plus-AM-AH.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795533", "eventUri": "eng-9795533", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Disney To Report.", "body": "Disney hiked streaming prices on Tuesday ahead of its Q3 results early Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones entertainment behemoth is enjoying its first box-office success for the Marvel Cinematic Universe in years, and recently extended its deal with the NBA with a new sports streaming service to debut later this fall. Disney stock climbed Tuesday.\n\nDisney (DIS) on Tuesday announced plans to raise subscription prices for its various streaming platforms. Starting Oct. 17, basic Disney+ plans will increase to $9.99 per month from $7.99, while the ad-free plan will increase by $2 to $15.99 per month. Hulu with ads will cost an additional $2 per month at $9.99. The ad-free version of Hulu will cost $18.99 monthly, up from $17.99.\n\nDisney also plans to raise the price of ESPN+ by $1 to $11.99 per month. The price for the basic Disney+ and Hulu bundle is increasing by $1 to $10.99 per month, but the price of the ad-free bundle will stay at $19.99 per month.\n\nHulu + Live TV plans with ads will increase to $82.99 per month from $76.99. The ad-free version of Hulu + Live TV will increase to $95.99 per month from $89.99.\n\nPreviously on July 25, Disney announced a Disney+, Hulu and Max Bundle via an agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. Basic versions of the bundle with ads costs $16.99 per month while the bundle without ads runs for $29.99 per month. The plans offer a 38% discount compared with purchasing the services separately, according to Disney.\n\nDisney stock traded near the bottom of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the second quarter, ending with an almost 24% decline for the quarter.\n\nWill TV Deals, Marvel Mojo Help Disney Stock?\n\nThe report comes after the July 26 release of \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" Disney's first R-rated flick that has already grossed more than $824 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. The film has already made nearly $396 million in the U.S., surpassing Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\" as the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time domestically, not accounting for inflation. Gibson's 2004 film generated $370 million at domestic box offices and held the title for 20 years.\n\nThe new Deadpool film is also on track to top the worldwide gross for Disney's \"Inside Out 2,\" which generated $1.55 billion worldwide following its June 14 release.\n\nElsewhere, Venu Sports last Thursday announced it will cost $42.99 per month when it launches later this fall. The stand-alone streaming service is a joint venture between Disney's EPSN, Fox (FOXA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and will offer thousands of live sports events from major pro leagues and top college conferences. The service will have 14 live channels and a library of on-demand content from the companies' network portfolios and ESPN+.\n\nHowever, Disney is still looking to cut costs as its traditional TV assets struggle. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Disney plans to cut 2% of the staff at Disney Entertainment Television, representing about 140 jobs.\n\nOn the theme-park front, Disney on July 29 avoided what would have been its first strike in 40 years at its Disneyland Resort after reaching a three-year contract with unionized workers. The deal includes a $24 hourly minimum wage, wage increases, flexible attendance and sick-leave policies, among other benefits. Disney Workers Rising, which represents 14,000 Disney employees across four unions, has been negotiating with Disney management since late April.\n\nESPN will continue as the exclusive home of the NBA Finals. And the full package of NBA and WNBA events and programming will be available on ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer platform, which will launch fall 2025, Disney said.\n\nBut Warner Bros. filed a breach-of-contract suit against the NBA in late July, claiming the league violated its media-rights agreement with its TNT network, the Wall Street Journal reported. Warner sought to exercise a contract clause allowing it to match rival bids, but the NBA rejected that move, saying TNT's offer didn't match Amazon's.\n\nDisney Earnings\n\nFactSet expects Disney to report a 16.5% increase in adjusted earnings to $1.20 per share on 3.3% revenue growth to $23.08 billion.\n\nAnalysts predict Disney+ subscribership falls to 152.65 million paid subscribers, down from 157.8 million last year and 153.6 million in Q2, respectively.

That includes all of its stand-alone tiers for the three streaming services, as well as one of its bundles.\n\nAd-supported plans for Hulu and Disney+ will increase by $2 to $9.99 monthly each. Hulu's premium plan will cost $1 more at $18.99 per month, while the Disney+ premium plan will go up $2 to $15.99 monthly.

Originally priced at $6.99, subscribers will now have to pay $15.99 for the service's ad-free tier -- more than double what it was in 2019.\n\nThe price rise is part of increases across the board ahead of Disney's quarterly earnings call, which is set for tomorrow morning. Along with Disney+, sister service Hulu will see its ad-free tier jump from $17.99 to $18.99 per month, with ESPN+ rising from $10.99 to $11.99. The ad-supported versions of the services are getting more expensive as well, with both rising by $2 to $9.99 per month.\n\nA report by THR speculates that the price increase is intended to push consumers toward The Disney Bundle, which will offer the ad tiers of Disney+ and Hulu for $10.99 per month. A streaming bundle featuring ad-supported versions of Disney+, Hulu, and Max is also available for $16.99 per month ($29.99 for the ad-free version.)\n\nThe price increases will go into effect on October 17.\n\nThe Disney+ price increase is just the latest in a wave of price rises as distributors seek to pass along the expense of running a streaming service to consumers. Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount are among the streamers to raise their prices in 2024. As we wrote in January, streaming is changing, and we're footing the bill.\n\nIn the meantime, Disney+ has struggled to reach its potential since launching in 2019, costing Disney billions of dollars in the process. We wrote in our 2023 review, \" If you're a Star Wars or Marvel die hard then of course this service is a must, but the thing that really makes it stand out is its back catalog of hard to find old Disney classics. While its ad-supported service is relatively affordable, ad-free Disney+ has almost doubled in price since 2019, and with the streamer removing movies and shows, subscribers are arguably paying more for less. But with originals like Ahsoka and Loki Season 2 still driving the pop culture conversation, those price hikes are likely worth it for most subscribers.\"\n\nFor more, check out all of the biggest TV shows due to release in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Disney+ has been having fewer and fewer new original releases and the price rises do feel over the top. Especially without ads, which is why Disney is trying to push more people towards it. The price of Hulu+Live TV also feels like it's going to push more people to \"cut the cord\", as it inches closer to $100 a month.\n\nWhat do you think of these price hikes?

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nDisney+ is raising its subscription prices again, marking the fourth increase in five years since it launched. Originally priced at $6.99, subscribers will now have to pay $15.99 for the service's ad-free tier -- more than double what it was in 2019.\n\nThe price rise is part of increases across the board ahead of Disney's quarterly earnings call, which is set for tomorrow morning. Along with Disney+, sister service Hulu will see its ad-free tier jump from $17.99 to $18.99 per month, with ESPN+ rising from $10.99 to $11.99. The ad-supported versions of the services are getting more expensive as well, with both rising by $2 to $9.99 per month.\n\nA report by THR speculates that the price increase is intended to push consumers toward The Disney Bundle, which will offer the ad tiers of Disney+ and Hulu for $10.99 per month. A streaming bundle featuring ad-supported versions of Disney+, Hulu, and Max is also available for $16.99 per month ($29.99 for the ad-free version.)\n\nThe price increases will go into effect on October 17.\n\nThe Disney+ price increase is just the latest in a wave of price rises as distributors seek to pass along the expense of running a streaming service to consumers. Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount are among the streamers to raise their prices in 2024. As we wrote in January, streaming is changing, and we're footing the bill.\n\nIn the meantime, Disney+ has struggled to reach its potential since launching in 2019, costing Disney billions of dollars in the process. We wrote in our 2023 review, \" If you're a Star Wars or Marvel die hard then of course this service is a must, but the thing that really makes it stand out is its back catalog of hard to find old Disney classics. While its ad-supported service is relatively affordable, ad-free Disney+ has almost doubled in price since 2019, and with the streamer removing movies and shows, subscribers are arguably paying more for less. But with originals like Ahsoka and Loki Season 2 still driving the pop culture conversation, those price hikes are likely worth it for most subscribers.\"\n\nFor more, check out all of the biggest TV shows due to release in 2024.\n\nKat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Discovery teamed up to launch a bundle of their assorted streaming services. Don't worry if you haven't heard the details yet, as an ad will soon show up in the middle of your favorite shows to fill you in.\n\nThe Disney Plus/Hulu/Max bundle, while not cleverly named, does exactly what it says on the label, making that trio of streaming services available for just one price. If you've already got all three services -- or you're thinking about doing so -- the appeal of this bundle lies in the fact that you can now subscribe for a reduced price over what you paid for each one separately.\n\nReally, it's a very appealing offer that promises to bring you three of the best streaming services at an attractive price. And I wouldn't touch the Disney Plus/Hulu/Max Bundle with a 10-foot pole.\n\nBefore we get into why I'm steering clear of this offer, let's drill down a little more into what you get by bundling together Disney Plus, Hulu and Max and how much it will cost you.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with what each service has to offer, Disney Plus boasts the a deep pool of titles pulled from Disney's library -- animated classics, Pixar movies and a host of original programming and theatrical releases feature Marvel and Star Wars. Hulu has an every shifting library of movies of its own and gives you access to original shows like \"Only Murders in the Building\" and rebroadcasts of current TV shows like \"The Bear.\" Max dips into the Warner Bros. film library, along with original HBO programming and -- less interestingly -- Discovery Channel filler.\n\nThe TLDR version of that last paragraph: the bundle will bring you a wide array of movies and shows across different genres. If you can't find at least half-a-dozen things in there that you like, you're a fussier viewer than me.\n\nAs to the price, the Disney Plus/Hulu/Max bundle starts at $16.99/month for an ad-supported version of those streaming services. To do away with ads, you'd pay $29.99/month.\n\nMy Tom's Guide colleague Alix Blackburn figures that you'd save nearly 35% with the ad-free bundle than you would if signed up for Disney Plus Premium ($13.99), Hulu without ads ($17.99) and the ad-free version of Max ($16.99). By my math, you're saving around $9 a month by opting for the lower-priced ad-supported version of the Disney Plus/Hulu/Max bundle.\n\nThat would be a compelling deal -- if I thought the price of the Disney Plus/Hulu/Max bundle would stay at $16.99 forever. But the last few years should have taught us all that prices of streaming service aren't carved in stone so much as they're written on dry-erase board.\n\nLifehacker recently tallied up how much subscription fees have gone up since 2023 for some of the more popular streaming services. Its research found that if you subscribed to Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, Max, Paramount Plus, Peacock, Apple TV Plus and Amazon Prime Video, you would have gone from paying $76.92 at the start of 2023 to $98.91. That's a 29% rise in 18 months.\n\nFor an even longer-term look at the trajectory of subscription fees, a site called TrackSub lists the prices of major streaming services dating back four to eight years, depending on the service in question. Increases range from a modest $1 monthly hike all the way up to $37 for various tiers of video streaming services.\n\nThe larger point is that video streaming prices only seem to go in one direction, and if you think the Disney Plus/Hulu/Max bundle is going to be the exception to that rule, I've got a streaming video series on the Brooklyn Bridge I'd like to sell you. What goes up may eventually have to go down, but try explaining that to executives at Disney or Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThere's not much we can do about rising streaming service costs, as those are likely to continue so long as studios try to make up for the revenue they're losing from cable cord-cutting. And at the end of the day, the no-commitment nature of streaming means that you can always cancel your subscription should the monthly costs become too much.\n\nBut there's a way that offerings like the Disney Plus/Hulu/Max bundle could become a safer bet, convincing skeptics like me to actually commit to such a service. And it means taking a cue from some of the best phone carriers.\n\nA trend currently taking place among wireless provides involves price lock guarantees. For example, Boost Mobile, as part of its recent rebranding, launched a plan with a lifetime guaranteed price of $25/month for unlimited data so long as you remain enrolled in autopay with the carrier. Verizon-owned Total Wireless introduced its own 5-year price guarantee in recent months, too, and we've even seen price locks offered from bigger carriers like T-Mobile and Verizon.\n\nStreaming services should follow suit. Guarantee that if I sign up for a service now, my rate won't go up for a set amount of time -- say, for a couple of years. This wouldn't be a contract binding me to a streaming service: I'd still be able to cancel at any time, though at the expense of giving up my guaranteed price. It would go a long way toward convincing me that a streaming service bundle is a sensible purchase.\n\nAs it stands, though, it's hard to take the savings being dangled by the Disney/Hulu/Max bundle seriously, when you know that a price hike is waiting just around the corner, like a disappointing Marvel TV series.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "philip_michaels@tomsguide.com", "name": "Philip Michaels", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Such bumps can be encouraging for shareholders of the companies behind the increases, however.\n\nThat was the case on Tuesday with Walt Disney (DIS 2.50%), following the entertainment giant's announcing hikes for most of its popular streaming video offerings -- one day before it's slated to publish its latest set of quarterly earnings. The company's share price closed the day 2.5% higher, easily topping the 1% gain of the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nDisney's stand-alone streamers are all getting price hikes. The company's flagship Disney+ will cost consumers 25% more -- $9.99 per month -- if they're willing to accept ads on the service. The price of ad-free Disney+ is being raised 14% to $15.99.\n\nHulu is to become pricier too; like the ads-included Disney+ tier, it's going to cost $9.99. The service's ad-free premium option is being lifted by $1 to $18.99. ESPN+ will be $1 more expensive per month, as its cost is rising to $11.99.\n\nAs for Disney's popular bundle of services, the Trio -- Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ -- is getting a $2-per-month price bump. This applies to both the ad-supported and ad-free versions. The new prices for the pair are $16.99 and $26.99, respectively.\n\nThe only Disney streaming option that isn't getting a price raise is the ad-free Duo (which wraps Disney+ and Hulu without ESPN+). This holds steady at $19.99 per month. The ad-supported Duo, though, is getting a $1 increase to $10.99.\n\nThe new pricing will go into effect on Oct. 17.\n\nIn its press release unveiling the price increases, Disney attempted to emphasize a new feature -- a set of continuous, curated playlists for Disney+ -- in order to soften the blow. It didn't necessarily need to, as the hikes aren't high enough to spark a consumer rebellion. Customer defection shouldn't be too painful, and the higher take will help stem the losses Disney has famously absorbed from operating its streamers.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_volkman@fool.com", "name": "Eric Volkman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_(broadcasting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flagship (broadcasting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/786200/three-young-people-seated-on-a-couch-and-watching-tv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795533", "eventUri": "eng-9795533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 1621, "textEnd": 1628}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It's been proven that subscribers who sign up for discounted bundles are less likely to unsubscribe since they regularly still use one part of the bundle, providing value and incentive to keep it.\n\nWhen compared to other streaming services, the bundle is priced much higher than most other streaming services, but I do question a major aspect of this data since it's comparing the ad-free version, whereas it's likely more people are signing up for the ad-supported plan, which is just $16.99 a month.\n\nThe key aspect of this bundle is that when new subscribers are signing up, they feel that adding the bundle option makes more sense since it's so much more cheaper.\n\nIn terms of the amount of content, Netflix Standard (without ads), still offers the most amount of content for a single subscription, but Hulu is only just behind it.\n\nRoger's Take: With this data only suggesting that the bundle is a dollar overpriced, it doesn't seem too much of a difference and it also gives Disney and Warner Brothers Discovery some wriggle room to do some promotions, especially with the launch of Venu Sports later this year and over the holidays. Ultimately, they are going to want to get people locked in on the ad-supported tier because that's where they get more money per subscriber.\n\nDo you think the Disney+ Hulu Max bundle is overpriced?

Disney is introducing something similar to live channels in the form of continuous playlists and adding ABC News Live right into its already popular service.\n\nIncreases across the board\n\nThe price increases are pretty widespread, though. They impact Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN with or without ads, as well as bundles. Disney Plus and Hulu monthly options are increasing by $2, while ESPN will cost $1 more a month.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the increases for customers in the United States:\n\nBundle price increases are a bit more wide-ranging. The basic Disney Duo plan, which includes Disney Plus and Hulu with ads, will increase by $1 to $10.99 from $9.99. That same bundle without ads stays at $19.99 a month, though. However, getting Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and Hulu with ads jumps by $2 to $26.99 a month from $24.99.\n\nHulu's Live TV bundles, which include access to Disney Plus and ESPN, are also increasing by $6. Thus, Hulu + Live TV with ads for on-demand content jumps to $82.99 from $76.99, and that same bundle without ads for on-demand content is now at $95.99 from $89.99.\n\nYou'll have until October 17, 2024, to consider the price increases, but as of now, no users are grandfathered in, so you will see the increase hit then.\n\nThe cost of new features\n\nStill, for that price increase, Disney Plus is getting an ABC News Live integration directly into the platform on September 4, 2024, which falls ahead of the upcoming 2024 Election - meaning this could be a great resource. Additionally, these playlists providing a continuous stream of content will be grouped by category, with a pre-school-themed one launching first. You can likely expect to see \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,\" \"Bluey,\" and \"Sofia The First\" in the mix here.\n\nAt some point after, other themes like Star Wars and Marvel will be launched under \"Epic Content\" alongside \"Throwbacks,\" \"Real Life,\" and other seasonal content. However, these and presumably any others will only be for premium customers, aka those without advertisements.\n\nThe price increase also comes a day after Disney Plus added a new environment to its app on the Apple Vision Pro. With it, you can now watch \"The Mandalorian,\" a throwback hit like \"Hannah Montana,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" \"Only Murders In The Building,\" or any other piece of content on what feels like an infinitely large screen with the backdrop of Iceland's Thingvellir National Park courtesy of National Geographic. Other platforms are adding similar Vision Pro content features. You can watch movies with SpongeBob in Paramount Plus now and even catch jellyfish.\n\nYou'll ultimately have to weigh the cost of the increase, including the person writing this story who has Hulu + Live TV, and see if it works out. And who knows, maybe Disney is working on other features or content additions to its streaming services.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_krol@techradar.com", "name": "Jacob Krol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC News Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grandfather clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluey_(2018_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bluey (2018 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_(American_TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic (American TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Montana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Montana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_the_First", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sofia the First"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foxtel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpongeBob SquarePants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_Clubhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qkz8FzNKCPznmZbPn6BJsD-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795533", "eventUri": "eng-9795533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1145}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Last year, however, only the ad-free tiers were impacted.\n\nBut with the price hikes, Disney is also adding new features to Disney+.

Other channels based on seasonal content, retro and nostalgia programming, real-life programming, and \"epic stories\" like Marvel and Star Wars will be added later in the fall, but only for Premium subscribers.\n\n\"Playlists are the latest example of how we're providing the best value and experience for our subscribers every time they open Disney+,\" said Alisa Bowen, president of Disney+, in a statement. \"Whether its news, kids' content, popular genres, hit TV shows or blockbuster films, there will be something for everyone in a lean-back viewing experience based on seasonality and interest.\"\n\nThe playlists operate similarly to the \"channels\" users can find on free streaming services like Pluto TV and Tubi, with a linear schedule built around a specific theme or genre. They allow users to jump in and start watching, without having to hunt around for something to watch, and some media executives believe they can help increase \"stickiness\" and viewership.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_weprin@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Alex Weprin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Music_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Music Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tubi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_Dog_Pals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puppy Dog Pals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pluto TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Lion Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_the_First", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sofia the First"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TCDMAND_G5090-H-2024.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795533", "eventUri": "eng-9795533", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "textStart": 1053, "textEnd": 1060}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 1701, "textEnd": 1708}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Such bumps can be encouraging for shareholders of the companies behind the increases, however.\n\nThat was the case on Tuesday with Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), following the entertainment giant's announcing hikes for most of its popular streaming video offerings -- one day before it's slated to publish its latest set of quarterly earnings. The company's share price closed the day 2.5% higher, easily topping the 1% gain of the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nDisney's stand-alone streamers are all getting price hikes. The company's flagship Disney+ will cost consumers 25% more -- $9.99 per month -- if they're willing to accept ads on the service. The price of ad-free Disney+ is being raised 14% to $15.99.\n\nHulu is to become pricier too; like the ads-included Disney+ tier, it's going to cost $9.99. The service's ad-free premium option is being lifted by $1 to $18.99. ESPN+ will be $1 more expensive per month, as its cost is rising to $11.99.\n\nAs for Disney's popular bundle of services, the Trio -- Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ -- is getting a $2-per-month price bump. This applies to both the ad-supported and ad-free versions. The new prices for the pair are $16.99 and $26.99, respectively.\n\nThe only Disney streaming option that isn't getting a price raise is the ad-free Duo (which wraps Disney+ and Hulu without ESPN+). This holds steady at $19.99 per month. The ad-supported Duo, though, is getting a $1 increase to $10.99.\n\nThe new pricing will go into effect on Oct. 17.\n\nIn its press release unveiling the price increases, Disney attempted to emphasize a new feature -- a set of continuous, curated playlists for Disney+ -- in order to soften the blow. It didn't necessarily need to, as the hikes aren't high enough to spark a consumer rebellion. Customer defection shouldn't be too painful, and the higher take will help stem the losses Disney has famously absorbed from operating its streamers.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

Later this year, premium subscribers will get channels devoted to documentaries, action films and pop culture.\n\nIn recent months, rival online video services including Netflix, Comcast's Peacock and Warner Bros Discovery's Max have also announced plans to raise prices.

Popular content on Disney+ includes Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar films, with Avengers: Endgame and Inside Out 2 trending. Stay tuned for future streaming updates on Collider and prepare for Deadpool & Wolverine by watching Deadpool 2 on Disney+.\n\nFans of Disney+ just got some bad news, but albeit news that was fairly easy to predict was coming at some point. Disney has officially announced that several tiers which fall under its streaming and television umbrella are getting price increases, from standard Disney+ to Hulu with live TV and everything in between. Starting off the change in prices are the two basic Disney+ subscription packages, one with ads and one without. The ads-included tier will rise from $7.99 to $9.99, while the ad-free tier price will increase from $13.99 to a whopping $15.99 per month. The basic, ads-included plan for the Disney+ and Hulu bundle is also rising from $9.99 to $10.99. However, the ad-free bundle of Disney+ and Hulu will stay the same at $19.99 per month.\n\nHulu's standalone streaming service is also getting a price raise for both of its subscription tiers, with the ad tier rising from $7.99 to $9.99 and the ad-free tier rising from $17.99 to $18.99. Disney's hub for all things sports, ESPN+, will see price increases as well, rising from $10.99 to $11.99. Hulu with live TV is getting the biggest price increase of all, with the ads-included package rising from $76.99 to $82.99, and the ad-free package increasing to $95.99 from $89.99. Lastly, the triple bundle package with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ will also raise its prices with ads-included going from $14.99 to $16.99, and ad-free up to $26.99 from $24.99.\n\nWhat's Streaming on Disney+ That's Popular at the Moment?\n\nClose\n\nThe most appealing part of Disney+ has always been the IP's under its large umbrella, whereas other services like Netflix are constantly securing the rights to popular shows like Suits or Prison Break. While you won't ever see Breaking Bad streamed on Disney+, you don't ever have to worry about where any Marvel or Star Wars projects are going to air, as well as animated films from Disney and Pixar.\n\nBoth Deadpool movies and Logan have seen an increase in popularity on Disney+ with the recent release of Deadpool & Wolverine, while Avengers: Endgame has also recently crept into the top 10. Many fans have also been streaming the first Inside Out, while the sequel, Inside Out 2, continues breaking box office records and now sits as one of the top 10 highest-grossing movies of all-time.\n\nThe Disney+ price increases will go into effect later this year.

The same is true for Hulu and ESPN+.\n\nThe three streaming video services are ready to watch on Mac, iPad, iPhone or Apple TV. It'll just cost a bit more in a few months.\n\nDisney+ is the home of Star Wars, Marvel and more, but it's not a big a success as some might think. It has 11% of the U.S. streaming market, according to analysts. That puts it just a bit ahead of rival Apple TV+, which has 9% of the market. And Hulu has 10% of the market, so it's also in the same neighborhood.\n\nStill, Disney made a profit off these two services in the second quarter of this year, and says it expects them \"to be a meaningful future growth driver for the company, with further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nPart of the reason they'll be profitable is an upcoming increase in subscription fees. The cost of Disney+ without ads is going up to $15.99 a month (previously $13.99/mo). An annual no-ads subscription will be $159.99 per year (previously $139.99/yr).\n\nWith ads, the Disney+ will be $9.99 per month, up from $7.99/mo. There's no annual subscription option.\n\nFor comparison, Disney+ debuted in 2019 at $6.99 per month with no commercial interruptions. That later went up to $7.99 per month, then $10.99 per month, then $13.99 per month. The cost jumps almost every year, but the streaming service was not at all profitable in its early days.\n\nThe sister service Hulu without ads will soon be $18.99 per month. With ads, the cost is $9.99 or $99.99 a year.\n\nAfter the latest price increase, Disney's sports streaming service ESPN+ will cost $11.99 or $119.99 a year. This includes commercials, and there's no option to avoid the ads.\n\nThe price changes are set to take effect October 17, 2024.

The prices will take effect from October 17 and affect Disney+, Hulu and ESPN - the three streaming services run by the entertainment giant.\n\nDisney+ with adverts rise to $9.99 from $7.99 a month - a 25 per cent increase.The advert-free tier will go up $2 to $15.99. Meanwhile, at Hulu the tier with adverts also goes up $2 to $9.99. The advert free version rises $1 to $18.99.\n\nThe price hikes seem aimed at pushing customers to The Disney Bundle - which includes both Disney+ and Hulu with adverts for $10.99, after a $1 rise. That works out at only a dollar more than getting either service on their own. ESPN+ with ads also rises by $1 to $11.99.\n\nNews of the rise broke around 1pm ET, and was thought to have been leaked by the company ahead of its latest quarterly earnings report tomorrow. Soon after, streaming fans took to social media claiming they would cancel their subscriptions - fed up with price rises.\n\nDisney is the latest to raise prices as TV streamers seek to turn a profit on businesses that until now have lost money. They have been willing to spend on big budget shows - but offer cut-price subscriptions - in a bid to lure in customers. But investors now want to see a return.\n\nPeacock rolled out prices rises from July 19. The $2 a month increase took the price for its standard service - confusingly called 'Premium' to $7.99. The annual cost rose $20 from $59.99 to $79.99.\n\nBoth work out as a huge 33 percent price rise. At the end of June, it emerged that Paramount+ Essential will rise by $2 to $7.99 for new customers - also a 33 percent price rise. Current customers pay the same. Prices rises take effect on August 20.\n\nEarlier in June, Warner Bros. Discovery raised the price of its ad-free Max subscription for the second time in year. The $1 price rise to $16.99 a month for the ad-free tier took effect last month for new subscribers.\n\nThe 'ultimate' ad-free option, which offers 4k streaming and the ability to run four accounts at the same time, will also be raised by a $1 to $20.99. Spotify also announced last month that the cost of its Individual ad-free premium subscription plan in the US will go up by $1 a month to $11.99.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

But investors have been cautious of late, with shares reversing prior gains to fall more than 20% over the last three months.\n\nHere's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\n\nGuidance will be closely watched after last quarter's disappointing forecast led to concerns over the company's long-term outlook.\n\nIn May, Disney said an important part of its streaming business turned a profit for the first time but that it expects weaker results in that segment for the third quarter, highlighting the challenges in achieving sustainable streaming profitability, a key priority as its linear TV business declines.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company announced price hikes will once again hit its various streaming services. The monthly cost of the Disney+ ad tier will rise by $2 to $9.99, while the ad-free version will also tick up by $2 to hit $15.99.\n\nSimilarly, Hulu's ad-supported tier will rise by $2 to $9.99 per month, with the ad-free version rising by $1 to $18.99. The Disney Bundle will offer ad tiers of Disney+ and Hulu for $10.99 per month, up $1 from its previous price and an overall more attractive offering compared to the individual plans.\n\nThe price changes, among others announced, are set to go into effect on Oct. 17. Disney expects full streaming profitability by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n\"A faster track to significant earnings would be a plus for the direct to consumer segment,\" CFRA analyst Ken Leon wrote in a note ahead of the earnings release.\n\nLeon added the company's renewed deal with the NBA will also be top of mind for investors, particularly when it comes to how much Disney is willing to spend on expensive sports rights.\n\nOutside of the NBA, the company will debut a new sports streaming platform with Fox (FOXA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) sometime this fall at a price point of $42.99 a month. It's also working on a separate sports streaming platform for ESPN, set to debut in fall 2025.\n\nParks remain another area of concern after the company said third quarter operating income for the segment should be \"roughly comparable to the prior year.\"\n\nAt the time, Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said the company has seen \"some evidence of a global moderation from peak post-COVID travel\" at its theme parks. He also noted rising costs and inflation will likely register a hit to profits.\n\nIn a note to clients last month, KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel said attendance at Disney's theme parks was only up one out of 30 days year over year in June, citing internal domestic geolocation data.\n\n\"Looking forward, we'd expect continued softness, which could lead to deceleration or potentially declines in revenue for domestic parks,\" the analyst said.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed the demand outlook will likely weigh on results but that any weakness should be \"temporary given a $60 billion investment commitment as well as the launch of new cruises in fiscal 2025-2026 which will double capacity.\"\n\nIn one bright spot, Disney's theatrical power seems to be back on track with strong showings from films like \"Inside Out 2\" and the more recent \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" It's also on pace to lead the box office in the back half of this year with the upcoming releases of \"Moana 2\" and \"Mufasa: The Lion King.\"\n\nBut analysts say the focus will remain on parks and streaming.\n\n\"While we think [Disney's theatrical comeback] is nice incremental revenue and operating income, theatrical results are hardly the driver of profitability that they used to be,\" Nispel said.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Despite mostly keeping her personal life private, she occasionally shares glimpses into her family life on social media.\n\nThe actress has been married to actor/producer/director Marcello Thedford for 16 years, and the couple met 28 years ago while shooting a movie in Rome. McGee's acting credits include '90s series such as Martin, Family Matters, and The Sinbad Show, as well as a recent appearance in her former co-star Danielle Fishel's Tubi Original movie Classmates.\n\nTrina McGee is not the only celebrity mom to welcome a baby later in life. Stars like Cameron Diaz and Naomi Campbell have also had children past the age of 50. Diaz welcomed her son at 51, while Campbell gave birth to her second child at 53.\n\nAs McGee prepares to expand her family, fans and followers have sent their well wishes and congratulations to the actress on her exciting news.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Meets_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boy Meets World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trina_McGee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trina McGee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Supremes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belize"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belize"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tubi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sinbad_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sinbad Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Fishel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Fishel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Diaz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets_and_Bedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets and Bedding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/boy-meets-worlds-trina-mcgee-is-pregnant-at-54.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622222", "eventUri": "eng-9622222", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 158, "textEnd": 164}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The couple met in Rome 28 years ago while shooting the action thriller movie Daylight. The 54 year old is best known for her role as Angela Moore, the love interest of Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong) in the hit US TV sitcom Boy Meets World.\n\nFollowing news of her pregnancy, fans looked back on previous snaps on Instagram and spotted her blossoming baby bump in a photo where she appeared to be on holiday.

McGee simply replied, \"Yup.\"\n\nMcGee has been married to husband Marcello Thedford since 2008. The couple met nearly three decades ago while shooting Sylvester Stallone's 1996 action-thriller Daylight. McGee was previously married to ex-husband Randall Courtland Davis from 1991 to 2001, and the exes share two children: Langston and Ramia. She also is mom to a third child from a previous relationship.\n\nMcGee is best known for her time on Boy Meets World, where she appeared as Shawn Hunter's (Rider Strong) love interest from 1997 to 2000. The actress, who is 11 years Strong's senior, shocked fans earlier this year when she revealed that she was actually pregnant while shooting the fifth season of the ABC sitcom.\n\n\"That time I played a teenager but in reality I was 6 months pregnant...,\" McGee wrote via TikTok in April to the background music of Brandy's hit \"Baby.\" McGee bobbed her head to the music with a smirk before the video cut to a photo of her character sporting a loose cardigan to cover up her growing baby bump during the season 5 episode \"And Then There Was Shawn.\"\n\n\"For those who didn't know... you gotta let 'em know,\" she captained the post.\n\nFans of the show quickly took to the comments section to share their disbelief. \"What? U were pregnant in the Halloween episode?! Thats wild! I would have never guessed.... that's my all time favorite episode,\" one person wrote, while another added, \"\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32 omg we had no idea! How old is your child now? You hid it well!!\"\n\nWhile McGee mostly opts to keep her private life out of the spotlight, she has been open about her time on Boy Meets World and its subsequent revival, Girl Meets World. In January 2020, she tweeted that she was labeled as \"Aunt Jemima\" by a cast member on the OG series, while she was \"met with cold blank stares\" on the Disney Channel spinoff.\n\nSix months later, amid the Black Lives Matter movement, Danielle Fishel, who portrayed Topagna Lawrence on both BMW and GMW, tweeted about doing research to become a better ally when a fan asked if she had apologized to McGee yet.\n\n\"I owed @realtrinamcgee an apology for being rude, cold, & distant when she guest starred on GMW (her tweet regarding warm hellos being met with cold blank stares was about me),\" Fishel, 43, wrote in response. \"Trina and I spoke over a month ago and she gracefully accepted my apology.\"\n\nMcGee, for her part, addressed the interaction in an interview later that year.\n\n\"I got a message from Danielle at the time, she wanted to talk,\" she told Yahoo Entertainment at the time. \"My relationship with her right now is decent. We're very complimentary of each other. ... She goes out of her way to say, 'Hey, are you OK?' She actually just sent me a cute picture of her baby, so I'm not trying to hang around and have a grudge against the girl or anything, I'm just slowly trying to take steps to trusting.\"\n\nMcGee also opened up about the \"Aunt Jemima\" comments, who were made by the actor who portrayed Eric Matthews, Will Friedle. She told the outlet that the actor had reached out to her and \"conveyed to me how much this has changed his perception of comedy. And humanity.\" She noted that in addition to Friedle's apology, she had also apologized to him for \"making the statements public because his joke came out of just not knowing, not viciousness and he forgave me. That's what friends do.\"\n\nWhen Friedle along with Fishel and Strong started their \"Pod Meets World\" rewatch podcast in 2022, McGee was one of the trio's first guests. There, Friedle confessed that his tension with McGee ultimately \"changed [his] life.\"\n\n\"That moment was the moment I was like, 'You can't just say stuff. You can't just throw things out there because you think it's funny and walk away,\" he said. \"You could be hurting people. You could legitimately be hurting people because you think it's funny.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kat_pettibone@usmagazine.com", "name": "Kat Pettibone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Fishel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Fishel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Supremes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Meets_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy Meets World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Stallone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belize"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belize"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Jemima", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aunt Jemima"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_Strong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rider Strong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy_Norwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandy Norwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Meets_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Girl Meets World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winter Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pod_Meets_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pod Meets World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Friedle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Friedle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-917205550.jpg?crop=0px%2C185px%2C2100px%2C1101px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622222", "eventUri": "eng-9622222", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 93, "textEnd": 99}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 2279, "textEnd": 2291}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

She shares two kids with her ex-husband Randall Courtland Davis, who she was married to from 1991 to 2001. She's been married to actor Marcello Thedford for over 16 years, according to People.

She sported a beautiful blue bathing suit top with a long gray skirt. Her baby bump could be seen poking out under the top. She also rocked a straw hat and had a yummy-looking dessert in her hand.

The actress, who played the girlfriend of Shawn Hunter (portrayed by Rider Strong) during the show's final three seasons, shared the exciting news on Instagram, per USAToday.\n\nA Joyful Surprise\n\n\"At the tender age of 54, I have found myself pregnant,\" McGee wrote in her heartfelt Instagram post. She requested prayers for a safe delivery and expressed gratitude for the well wishes she received from her followers. Alongside her announcement, she included the lyrics from The Supremes' classic song \"Baby Love.\"\n\nMcGee's unexpected pregnancy has sparked curiosity among fans, who were shocked to learn her age. The actress, who has been married to actor Marcello Thedford for 16 years, is already a mother of three. Two of her children are from her previous marriage to Randall Courtland Davis.\n\nHer journey in Hollywood has been both fascinating and unconventional. Joining \"Boy Meets World\" in Season 5, McGee portrayed a high schooler and college freshman while balancing her real-life role as a mother. She reflected on this surreal experience during an interview on \"Good Morning America\" in 2022.\n\nIn a surprising revelation, McGee shared a TikTok video in 2022 that showed her baby bump during the series' run. The caption humorously read, \"That time I played a teenager but in reality, I was 6 months pregnant.\" Fans were delighted by this behind-the-scenes glimpse into her life during the show.\n\nAge and Pregnancy Risks\n\nWhile McGee's pregnancy is a cause for celebration, it's essential to acknowledge the potential risks associated with pregnancies later in life. According to the Mayo Clinic, older mothers face a higher risk of complications, including the possibility of a C-section delivery. Additionally, babies born to older mothers have an increased risk of certain chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome.

She was pregnant with her third child for part of her tenure on the show, reflecting on her experience on Instagram she said: 'That time I played a teenager but in reality I was 6 months pregnant...'\n\nDuring the series, her character had a romance with Shawn Hunter, played by Rider Strong, and their interracial relationship was a rarity for major network sitcoms at that time.\n\nTrina previously spoke about moments when she felt she had to tone down her Blackness.\n\n'Coming from Black sitcoms, I always had to have like a Black meter,' she said.\n\n'My Black meter was probably down to a two. I remember when I was doing Angela's Ashes episode, somehow my Black meter had slipped up, and I was at about a nine,' she added to the Pod Meets World podcast.\n\nShe later explained that she was asked her to 'turn down the Telma Hopkins' persona about eight notches'. Hopkins is a Black actress best known for starring in Family Matters.\n\n'I knew exactly what he was talking about,' said Trina.\n\nTrina has also starred in Martin, Family Matters and The Sinbad Show.\n\nBoy Meets World is available to stream on Disney Plus.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page -

Every now and then though, the actors reveal interesting tidbits about their time on the young adult sitcom in addition to sharing updates on their lives. Trina McGee-Davis, who played the role of Angela Moore during the final three seasons, has shared such details. Most recently, the 54-year-old actress revealed that she's pregnant with another child. That's definitely big news, but what you may find even more intriguing is that, at one point, McGee was on the show while she was six months pregnant.\n\nA mother of three already, the actress took to Instagram to announce that she's expecting her fourth child. Her post simply included a video with a message that formally confirmed her expectancy. Playing over the clip was a snippet of the hit song \"Baby Love\" from The Supremes. Her official message on the matter read as follows:\n\nShe also confirmed in her caption that she was planning to \"sign off social media for a bit\" and thanked fans for their support. Many took to the comment section to extend congratulations to her. They did the same in another recent post of hers, which was taken from her trip to Belize. In the snapshot, the Friday After Next alum's baby bump was clearly visible, much to the delight of her social media followers. Check it out:\n\nMajor congratulations are definitely in order, and she seems excited about her latest child's arrival. And, based on that vacation post, she already seems to be going in on her baby bump journey. It's sweet news but, still, as this development comes to surface, I can't help but think about the time she was pregnant while filming one of the greatest TGIF comedies.\n\nTrina McGee-Davis revealed this interesting behind-the-scenes fact in a TikTok video she shared back in 2022. In the brief clip, the actress appears on screen and, under her is the caption, \"that time I played a teenager, but in reality, I was [six] months pregnant.\" The video then transitions to a still of McGee-Davis in character as Angela in Boy Meets World. Said image is from the Season 5 episode \"And Then There Was Shawn.\" Take a look:\n\nIn hindsight, it's honestly wild to think that the star was expecting at the time, especially amid the taping of that episode. The installment - which played on tropes from various slasher films - required a bit more physical activity from the stars. In some cases, they were rushing around the corridors of the fictional John Adams High School to evade a killer. Kudos to the actress as well as the costume designers for ensuring that the baby bump was hidden.\n\nOne could definitely argue that Trina McGee-Davis' time on the show was \"complex.\" From the jump, the producers went through a lot of hurdles to cast her as Angela. Later on, not only was she older than her Boy Meets World co-stars, but she was also the only person of color in the main cast. In recent years, she's been open about \"disrespectful\" incidents she experienced, at least one of which was tied to her race. All in all though, she continues to embrace her role as a series alum and has since made amends with some of her former colleagues.\n\nOne would hope that her former co-stars will wish her well with this latest pregnancy as plenty of fans have already. Here's wishing her all the best as she prepares for the arrival of her latest baby.\n\nYou can revisit Trina McGee-Davis' performance as Angela on Boy Meets World by streaming the entire series with a Disney+ subscription.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_swann@cinemablend.com", "name": "Erik Swann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trina_McGee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trina McGee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Meets_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy Meets World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGIF_(TV_programming_block)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TGIF (TV programming block)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Supremes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belize"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belize"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slasher_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slasher film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trope (literature)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y5BpDQ4h6FhWw5u6MesXLW-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622222", "eventUri": "eng-9622222", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Take your social media break for your peace as needed.\"\n\nIn light of McGee's surprise pregnancy announcement, curiosity about her husband, whom she rarely discussed publicly, has surged.\n\nPer The Sun, her partner, who is also an actor, producer, and director, has been her spouse for 16 years. The duo's story began in the '90s while they were filming the action thriller \"Daylight\" in Rome.\n\nAside his minor role in the Sylvester Stallone movie, Thedford is recognized for his performances in \"Volcano\" and \"Employee of the Month.\" He also ventured into directing, producing, and co-writing the 2009 film \"Thug Love.\"\n\nIn October 2022, Maitland Ward opened up about the varying reactions she received from her former castmates regarding her career switch to adult entertainment.\n\nThe Blast noted that she shared the details during an appearance on the \"Skinny Confidential Him & Her\" podcast.\n\nWard disclosed that one of the three former sitcom stars who reached out to her was Trina McGee, who she noted showed support \"in the beginning.\"\n\nThe second person was Will Friedle, who also reached out after Ward's adult film career began gaining traction. As to how he really felt, Ward revealed, \"[He] says he supports me, but won't watch anything that I do.\"\n\nShe also mentioned that the show's creator, Michael Jacobs, was supportive of her career shift.\n\nWhile Ward acknowledged that not all her former castmates reached out to her after her career shift, she emphasized that she did not receive any direct negative feedback.\n\nHowever, in the interview, Ward opened up about feeling isolated from some of her former castmates after her career transition.\n\nHer memoir, \"Rated X: How Porn Liberated Me From Hollywood,\" included interactions with Danielle Fishel, who portrayed Topanga Lawrence on the show.\n\nWard recalled a party where she encountered Fishel, noting that Fishel did not engage with her and barely acknowledged her presence. In her words:\n\n\"Danielle didn't speak to me at all, which I thought was odd. She barely acknowledged that I was even there.\"\n\nDespite their shared history, Ward described not feeling a sense of distance, especially since their last interaction at Ward's wedding in 2006.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afouda_bamidele@theblast.com", "name": "Afouda Bamidele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trina_McGee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trina McGee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congratulations_(Cliff_Richard_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Janet Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitland_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maitland Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Supremes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Meets_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy Meets World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jacobs_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jacobs (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Him_&_Her", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Him & Her"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Fishel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Fishel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Friedle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Friedle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Stallone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topanga,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Topanga, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Topanga, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Outplacement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Outplacement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1540x712/2024/06/04091210/Trina-McGee-scaled-e1717506952552.jpeg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622222", "eventUri": "eng-9622222", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

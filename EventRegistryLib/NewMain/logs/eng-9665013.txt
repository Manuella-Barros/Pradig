As such, cybersecurity teams will need tools and platforms that enable them to fight fire with fire, he added.\n\nIt's not clear how many phishing simulations an organization should be creating but there's no doubt training will need to improve. It may be more difficult than ever to detect a phishing campaign crafted using a generative AI tool. However, there is usually some sense of urgency being created that end users should learn to be wary of, as the number of phishing emails continues to increase. For example, an email asking an end user to create an exception to a process even when it appears to have come from a CEO or CFO should automatically require additional confirmation.\n\nThat issue will become even more problematic when phishing attacks include deep fakes that incorporate audio and video files that appear to be from someone an end user might implicitly trust, noted Benishti.\n\nThe one thing that is certain is the Nigerian Prince era of phishing attacks that could be easily detected because of errors in grammar or misuse of colloquial phrases is now all but over. Cybercriminal gangs will no longer have to spend nearly as much time and effort honing content as they once did. The overall cost of launching a phishing campaign in the age of generative AI may soon approach zero.\n\nAI tools, hopefully, will make it easier to identify anomalies indicative of a phishing campaign that most end users would not initially spot. However, there will inevitably be phishing campaigns that by dint of sheer volume will make it into an email inbox. The challenge then becomes providing the level of training required to make sure end users remain constantly suspicious of any request that requires them to perform a task outside of a normal workflow. Even then, end users should ensure that additional communications, that confirm the identities of all parties involved in those workflows, are made using multiple mediums.\n\nThere will inevitably come a day when a phishing attack fueled by generative AI results in an all-but-inevitable breach. The challenge and the opportunity now is to define a set of processes that minimize the potential blast radius of a breach.

Hackers often utilize phishing emails as a method to breach security systems leading to data breaches, financial harm, and reputational damage for organizations.\n\nTo counter this danger, companies invest in training initiatives designed to educate staff on recognizing and mitigating phishing attacks. However, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of these training programs. This article will delve into approaches businesses can employ to evaluate the outcomes of phishing email training for employees.\n\nTraining schemes can bolster an organization's security posture by empowering employees with the necessary knowledge to swiftly identify and respond to potential risks, which is crucial for cybersecurity in the digital age. Failing to assess the efficacy of these programs could result in wasted resources and time dedicated to initiatives that might not be delivering results.\n\nBefore launching any phishing email training program, it is essential to establish employees' existing knowledge levels through training assessments. These assessments aim to gauge their familiarity with phishing tactics and their capacity to spot emails effectively.\n\nBy carrying out these evaluations, companies reap two advantages. First, it enables them to customize training materials based on identified gaps in knowledge or common misunderstandings about phishing emails. Second, it establishes a standard against which improvements in employee awareness can be assessed after training sessions.\n\nSimulated phishing attacks replicate real-life situations in which individuals receive emails designed to deceive them into sharing sensitive information or taking harmful actions unknowingly. These mimicked attacks are highly effective in gauging the success of an organization's training program.\n\nBy observing how employees respond to attacks before and after training sessions, companies gain insights into whether their employee's ability to recognize emails has improved or remained unchanged over time. Regularly conducting these assessments helps pinpoint weaknesses in training and enables interventions.\n\nMeasuring the rates of emails used in simulated attacks can offer insights to organizations on the efficacy of their phishing email training. Click rates may suggest a need for training or more focused content.\n\nFurthermore, keeping track of the number of employees reporting malicious emails is equally crucial. Reporting indicates that employees are actively participating in their training and are alert to threats.\n\nOrganizations should promote a culture that values and acknowledges reporting to reinforce desired behaviors.\n\nPost-training evaluations provide an opportunity for organizations to gather feedback from employees regarding the effectiveness of phishing email training. This feedback can be gathered through surveys or interviews, allowing employees to share any difficulties they encountered during the training and offer suggestions for improvement.\n\nThese assessments help measure employee satisfaction with the program and offer insights into areas that may need adjustments. Organizations can enhance training sessions by addressing employee concerns and preferences to better meet user expectations.\n\nRelying solely on evaluations and assessments may not provide a complete picture of an organization's security efforts. Continuously monitoring phishing incident data is essential to gain insights into the effectiveness of a phishing email training program.\n\nBy analyzing phishing attempts and incidents within an organization, stakeholders can identify patterns, trends, and vulnerabilities that may require attention or additional training. Regularly tracking this data enables organizations to keep their programs current and implement security measures.\n\nTo understand how effective phishing email training is, organizations can look into metrics associated with these attacks. By monitoring factors like click-through rates and response rates of real phishing emails, companies can evaluate employee actions and pinpoint areas needing more attention or enhancement. Examining these metrics yields data that complements assessment approaches, revealing patterns or weaknesses in an organization's security setup.\n\nAnother crucial aspect in gauging the success of phishing email training is assessing incident response time. This metric gauges how swiftly employees detect a phishing scam and report it appropriately. A quicker response time indicates heightened alertness and preparedness among staff members. By analyzing incident response times pre and post-training initiatives, organizations can ascertain if their programs lead to the identification and reporting of threats.\n\nPhishing attacks remain a concern for businesses globally. Educational efforts targeting employee awareness about the risks associated with phishing emails are vital for upholding cybersecurity practices within organizations.\n\nTo ensure the success of these efforts, it's important to assess the effectiveness of programs through both pre- and post-training evaluations, simulated phishing attempts, click rates and reports, evaluation of employees after training sessions, and consistently monitoring phishing incident data.", "source": {"uri": "innotechtoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Innovation & Tech Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "t_today@innotechtoday.com", "name": "T Today", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incident management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education and Training", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Business_Development", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Business Development", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Employee_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Employee Relations", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Education and Training", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Training", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Training", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://innotechtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3790151.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665013", "eventUri": "eng-9665013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

But the uptick started shortly after ChatGPT got launched. The attackers are definitely using AI to launch attacks that mimic emails far better than anything that they've done to date,\" she said.\n\nWith generative AI tools, the scammers can now work in multiple languages and with good grammar, Wilking said.\n\nThey are also \"really taking advantage of the helpful nature of hospitality.\"\n\nTwo-factor authentication\n\nTo be helpful to a supposed guest, a hotel owner is \"probably going to open up the attachment\" that is actually malware, she said.\n\nWilking said that in order to stay safe travelers and hosts should sign up for two-factor authentication when surfing online.\n\nREAD: Scammers out to steal travel bugs' data, money\n\nIn addition to providing a username and password, two-factor authentication requires users to verify their identity through an added factor, such as a one-time code sent to their mobile device or generated by an authenticator app.\n\n\"I know it can be a little bit painful just to set up and then you have to remember which phone it's on and everything,\" she said.\n\nHowever, the extra step \"is still hands down the best way to combat phishing and credential stealing,\" she said.\n\nAnd \"don't click on anything that looks suspicious, even if you think it might be real.

Every other property around it is $1,000 a night and this one's on sale for $200.\"\n\n\"We've set up AI models to detect those and either block them from getting on there to begin or take it down before there's any booking,\" she said.\n\nThough it remains modest for now, travel sites have seen the rise of suspected state actors, reported to be Russia and China, that are trying to cause online mischief or snoop on customers.\n\n\"Why would a nation-state go after a hotel chain?

In today's professional world, mobile devices can do basically everything a laptop or desktop can do -- including get phished. Mobile devices are increasingly the starting point of the modern kill chain, and mobile phishing plays an important role in the process. Understanding how threat actors attack mobile devices is the first step to keeping data and devices secure.\n\nWe typically think of phishing as something that happens via email. Business email compromise (BEC) attacks accounted for nearly $2.4 billion in cyber crime losses in 2021. As more and more of modern life takes place on mobile devices, cyber attackers are now specifically targeting those devices with increasingly creative schemes. Mobile phishing campaigns can take the form of SMS messages, phone calls, and more. Each attack is designed to deceive people into either divulging sensitive information or downloading malicious software.\n\nTo successfully complete a mobile phishing attack, threat actors use clever social engineering to convince you of their legitimacy. Typically, they target individuals within an organization as a means to an end -- their ultimate goal is to gain access to more important networks, systems, or files beyond the initial point of entry. In that sense, mobile phishing focuses on compromising a specific user's account as a first step toward a more advanced attack.\n\nMobile phishing attacks rely on various techniques designed to deceive users and steal sensitive information, and they can be extremely sophisticated. These are some of the most common tactics attackers use in mobile phishing schemes:\n\nThere has been an alarming rise in mobile phishing around the world. In 2022, a quarter of enterprise mobile device users fell victim to phishing attacks. Many of those users were deceived more than once and 40% of those users clicked on at least six malicious links. More than half of personal devices were exposed to some sort of mobile phishing attack at least once per quarter. These statistics and others outlined in the 2023 Global State of Mobile Phishing Report show how this particular type of attack represents a growing area of concern.\n\nChanges in work culture have certainly contributed to the uptick in mobile phishing, and hybrid work structures and BYOD policies have muddied the waters when it comes to corporate security protocols. With that said, any mobile device can be susceptible to phishing attacks, regardless of whether or not it is a personal device, what manufacturer it comes from, or what operating system it's running.\n\nIt's important to understand that successful mobile phishing attacks can be incredibly costly for the companies they target. For organizations of at least 5,000 employees, the financial impact of a successful phishing attack was nearly $4 million in 2022.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that mobile devices are inherently more vulnerable to cyber attacks than other devices. Smaller screens make it harder for people to spot suspicious messages, first of all. And the ubiquity of mobile devices, in particular smartphones, allows us to form shockingly casual relationships with these powerful pocket computers.\n\nEven as we take them for granted, our mobile devices quickly evolve into our digital avatars. Mobile devices are treasure troves of highly personal data, especially when it comes to BYOD programs that allow or encourage employees to use their personal phones for work purposes. If an attacker successfully completes a phishing attempt on a personal mobile device, it's likely not just that individual's personal data at stake. On the contrary, in today's work world, that personal device can easily serve as the key to their organization's most sensitive data.\n\nThose dynamics put some industries at higher risk of mobile phishing attacks than others. Highly regulated industries like insurance, banking, and legal are typically seen as the most lucrative marks because of the vast amount of sensitive data they own, manage, and transmit through their networks and across huge device fleets. Attackers often target high-profile individuals with high levels of clearance and unfettered access to sensitive resources. Specifically attacking executives like CEOs and CFOs in this way is a precision mobile phishing tactic called spearfishing.\n\nTo prevent mobile phishing attacks, individuals and organizations need to implement proactive measures. Here are some essential mobile security practices organizations can use to protect against potential threats:\n\nThere are also a number of tools and technologies out there that organizations can use to strengthen corporate security and prevent mobile phishing. Mobile device management (MDM) for corporate-owned devices is a step in the right direction, but it's not enough of a strategy on its own. You need a mobile endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution that extends security to personal devices as well as corporate-owned devices.\n\nLookout Mobile Endpoint Security is a mobile EDR solution that can detect and respond to threats in real-time -- including mobile phishing attempts -- ensuring your enterprise and data remain protected.

Personally, having grown up around cars thanks to my dad, a master mechanic, I see oil as messy and cumbersome. Data, in my view, is more akin to bacon -- universally enjoyed and valuable in various forms; everyone wants it and will go to great lengths to have an extra helping, maybe even pushing a sibling's arm out of the way to get the last piece.\n\nThe good news is that we know the primary method of gaining initial access to steal healthcare data, which simplifies our ability to set up a good defense. What is the method? Simply replace the action of reaching across the table to stab the last piece of bacon with phishing emails (and yes, I realize I can't stretch my bacon-data analogy much further).\n\nLet's examine some numbers to see why email security should be considered a top priority. Healthcare data has consistently been the top target for cyber threat actors over the past seven years. In 2023 alone, the Health and Human Services (HHS) reported 280 breaches, impacting 24.8 million individuals. Additionally, HHS is currently investigating 451 other incidents, potentially affecting another 120.1 million people.\n\nThe HHS \"Wall of Shame,\" established in 2009 to list breaches impacting 500 or more individuals, highlights the severity of these breaches. The six most significant breaches have compromised the data of 127.1 million individuals, surpassing the population of the top five US states combined from the 2023 census. The Anthem breach, now known as Elevance Health, in 2015 was the largest single affecting 78.8 million individuals, double California's population. If the HHS breaches from 2023 formed a state, it would rank as the third most populous.\n\nThe US Senate Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee summoned UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty to explain the events leading up to and during the recent Change Healthcare cyberattack. During the session, Witty revealed that a \"substantial portion\" of Americans were affected by the Change Healthcare breach in February 2024, potentially impacting a third of the US population, approximately 110 million people. This incident is the largest breach in the history of the HHS.\n\nTrustwave's report, Cybersecurity in the Healthcare Industry: Actionable Intelligence for an Active Threat Landscape, identifies phishing as the primary method threat actors use to infiltrate organizations. To counter this, organizations conduct phishing exercises to train employees, ensuring they can recognize and avoid real phishing attempts. Employees who fail these exercises must undergo additional training and face subsequent phishing tests.\n\nWhen employees report phishing emails, the organization must respond effectively. Rather than merely creating email rules to move or delete reported messages, it's essential to refine our controls. This action includes enhancing email filters, removing phishing emails from mailboxes, and preventing future occurrences.\n\nAt a recent conference attended by a number of security professionals, I conducted an experiment to illustrate the efficacy of proactive measures against phishing attacks. During the event's setup, I mentioned our marketing team placed a $250 Amazon gift card under one of the chairs. All the attendees had to do was stand up and check beneath their seat to see if they had won.\n\nUsing a tactic similar to those in phishing emails, I crafted my request to seem urgent and enticing. As expected, everyone fell for my ploy -- some even checked the empty chairs. I guess I must have appeared quite trustworthy, even though most attendees had met me only five minutes earlier.\n\nThe experiment explains why removing phishing emails from all mailboxes is more effective than just deleting them from individual inboxes. If half the audience knew about the fake gift card beforehand, my attempt to convince the others wouldn't work. This outcome parallels the effectiveness of removing multiple instances of the same phishing attempt from all mailboxes within the organization.\n\nTrustwave's MailMarshal offers robust solutions for these challenges. It allows organizations to create new rules based on reported phishing emails to block similar threats. The upcoming version of MailMarshal will enable the removal of phishing emails from all mailboxes within the organization, ensuring comprehensive protection against these attacks.\n\nWe can better protect sensitive data and maintain trust in our systems by staying vigilant and proactive in our cybersecurity measures, especially in the healthcare sector.", "source": {"uri": "trustwave.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "trustwave.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevance_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elevance Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Threat actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Change Healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Witty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Witty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Energy_Subcommittee_on_Oversight_and_Investigations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustwave_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trustwave Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitedHealth_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UnitedHealth Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email filtering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gift card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.trustwave.com/hubfs/Web/Defaults/2024-meta-image-home.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665013", "eventUri": "eng-9665013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

But the uptick started shortly after ChatGPT got launched. The attackers are definitely using AI to launch attacks that mimic emails far better than anything that they've done to date,\" she said.\n\nWith generative AI tools, the scammers can now work in multiple languages and with good grammar, Wilking said.\n\nThey are also \"really taking advantage of the helpful nature of hospitality.\"\n\nTo be helpful to a supposed guest, a hotel owner is \"probably going to open up the attachment\" that is actually malware, she said.\n\nWilking said that in order to stay safe travelers and hosts should sign up for two-factor authentication when surfing online.\n\nIn addition to providing a username and password, two-factor authentication requires users to verify their identity through an added factor, such as a one-time code sent to their mobile device or generated by an authenticator app.\n\n\"I know it can be a little bit painful just to set up and then you have to remember which phone it's on and everything,\" she said.\n\nHowever, the extra step \"is still hands down the best way to combat phishing and credential stealing,\" she said.\n\nAnd \"don't click on anything that looks suspicious, even if you think it might be real. If there's even a little bit of doubt, call the property, hosts, and customer support,\" she said.\n\nFake property?\n\nWilking said Booking.com and other major companies are cooperating closely and increasingly relying on AI to help in the fight.\n\nAI, for example, is helping thwart the proliferation of fake properties on platforms that are actually a bid to scam the user.\n\nScammers \"set up a fake property that looks like it's in the Swiss Alps. Every other property around it is $1,000 a night and this one's on sale for $200.\"\n\n\"We've set up AI models to detect those and either block them from getting on there to begin or take it down before there's any booking,\" she said.\n\nThough it remains modest for now, travel sites have seen the rise of suspected state actors, reported to be Russia and China, that are trying to cause online mischief or snoop on customers.\n\n\"Why would a nation state go after a hotel chain?

Historically, phishing scams attempt to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information like login credentials or financial details.\n\nTravel websites, in particular, offer lucrative opportunities for scammers due to the wealth of personal and financial information travelers share. The launch of ChatGPT marked a turning point, with scammers using these tools to craft persuasive phishing emails.\n\nAccording to Wilking, these AI-generated emails are not only grammatically correct but also capable of operating in multiple languages, making them more persuasive and harder to detect.\n\nRead Also: Booking.com Scams: Users Targeted by Hackers Who Put Stolen Account Details for Sale on Dark Web\n\nTo combat this growing threat, Marnie Wilking advises both travelers and hosts to adopt two-factor authentication (2FA) for their online activities.\n\nThis additional security measure requires users to verify their identity through a secondary method, such as a one-time code sent to their mobile device or created by an authenticator app.\n\nWhile setting up 2FA can be somewhat inconvenient, Wilking emphasized its effectiveness in preventing phishing and credential theft. In addition to using 2FA, Wilking urged caution when dealing with suspicious emails or attachments.\n\nShe recommended that if there is any doubt about the authenticity of a message, it is safer to contact the property or customer support directly rather than click on any links or attachments.\n\nBooking.com and other major companies also leverage AI to bolster their defenses against these scams. AI models are being used to detect and block fake properties listed on their platforms.\n\nThese fake listings often appear to offer exceptional deals in desirable locations to lure unsuspecting travelers. By identifying and removing these fraudulent listings, companies aim to protect users from falling victim to scams.\n\nAnother emerging concern is the involvement of suspected state actors in these cyber activities. Wilking mentioned reports of state actors from countries like Russia and China engaging in online espionage or mischief.\n\nAccording to Booking.com's internet safety boss, these actors may target specific hotel chains frequented by high-profile individuals, such as US senators, to gather intelligence or cause disruptions.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jace_dela_cruz@techtimes.com", "name": "Jace Dela Cruz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booking.com", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booking.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-factor authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Synthetic media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Login"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/448685/820/0/0/0/booking-com-warns-of-rise-in-ai-travel-scams-as-summer-travel-season-begins.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665013", "eventUri": "eng-9665013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

But the uptick started shortly after ChatGPT got launched. The attackers are definitely using AI to launch attacks that mimic e-mails far better than anything that they have done to date,\" she said.\n\nWith generative AI tools, the scammers can now work in multiple languages and with good grammar, Wilking said.\n\nThey are also \"really taking advantage of the helpful nature of hospitality\".\n\nTo be helpful to a supposed guest, a hotel owner is \"probably going to open up the attachment\" that is actually malware, she said.\n\nWilking said that in order to stay safe travellers and hosts should sign up for two-factor authentication when surfing online.\n\nIn addition to providing a username and password, two-factor authentication requires users to verify their identity through an added factor, such as a one-time code sent to their mobile device or generated by an authenticator app.\n\n\"I know it can be a little bit painful just to set up and then you have to remember which phone it's on and everything,\" she said.\n\nHowever, the extra step \"is still hands down the best way to combat phishing and credential stealing\", she said.\n\nAnd \"don't click on anything that looks suspicious, even if you think it might be real. If there's even a little bit of doubt, call the property, hosts, and customer support\", she said.\n\nWilking said Booking.com and other major companies are cooperating closely and increasingly relying on AI to help in the fight.\n\nAI, for example, is helping thwart the proliferation of fake properties on platforms that are actually a bid to scam the user.\n\nScammers \"set up a fake property that looks like it's in the Swiss Alps. Every other property around it is US$1,000 a night and this one's on sale for US$200\".\n\n\"We have set up AI models to detect those and either block them from getting on there to begin or take it down before there's any booking,\" she said.\n\nThough it remains modest for now, travel sites have seen the rise of suspected state actors, reported to be Russia and China, that are trying to cause online mischief or snoop on customers.\n\n\"Why would a nation-state go after a hotel chain? Well, if it's a hotel chain that they know is frequented by a US senator, why wouldn't they go after that?\" she said.

They target millions of users and compromise sensitive information.\n\nTraditional phishing detection methods, such as blacklists and heuristics, have proven inadequate in real-time detection, especially against zero-day attacks.\n\nThese attacks exploit system vulnerabilities before they are identified and addressed, making them particularly challenging to detect and mitigate.\n\nThe study aimed to bridge this gap by developing a browser extension that leverages machine learning to identify and classify phishing URLs in real time.\n\nThe research involved an extensive literature review, design, and implementation phases, culminating in a robust solution outperforming conventional security measures.\n\nImplementation and Performance\n\nThe implementation phase involved developing a machine learning model using Python and integrating it with a browser extension built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\n\nThe model was trained on publicly available datasets from sources like PhishTank and Kaggle, with features extracted from these datasets to enhance detection accuracy.\n\nThe Random Forest algorithm emerged as the top performer among various machine learning models tested, including Support Vector Machine, Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and K Nearest Neighbor.\n\nThe model achieved an impressive accuracy of 98.32%, precision of 98.62%, recall of 97.86%, and an F1-score of 98.24%.\n\nTo evaluate the model's zero-day detection capability, a 15-day testing period was conducted, during which 15 URLs were obtained daily from PhishTank.\n\nThe model demonstrated a high rate of correct predictions, achieving an overall accuracy rate of 99.11%.\n\nNotably, the model detected phishing URLs that evaded Google Safe Browsing, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying previously unseen threats.\n\nFuture Enhancements and Broader Implications\n\nThe study's findings underscore the potential of machine learning in enhancing cybersecurity.\n\nThe browser extension detects phishing websites in real time and includes a reporting system that allows users to flag suspicious websites.\n\nThis feature contributes to the continuous improvement of the model by updating the dataset with new phishing trends and tactics.\n\nFor future improvements, the researchers suggest implementing dynamic dataset updates to keep the model current with emerging phishing threats.\n\nAdditionally, integrating advanced algorithms and feature engineering can enhance the model's accuracy and adaptability.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to integrate this solution directly into web browsers as a built-in feature, providing seamless protection for users while browsing the internet.\n\nThe success of this study marks a significant step forward in the fight against phishing attacks.\n\nBy leveraging machine learning, the developed browser extension offers a robust and effective solution for real-time phishing detection, making the internet safer for everyone.\n\nIntegrating machine learning into browser extensions represents a promising advancement in cybersecurity.\n\nThe ability to detect zero-day phishing attacks with high accuracy protects users from potential threats and sets a new standard for online security measures.\n\nAs the digital landscape evolves, such innovative solutions will be crucial in safeguarding users' privacy and data.", "source": {"uri": "cybersecuritynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyber Security News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One popular PhaaS (Phishing-as-a-Platform) was Caffeine, which was first identified and reported by Mandiant researchers.\n\nMRxC0DER, an Arabic-speaking threat actor, developed and maintained the caffeine kit.\n\nHowever, Caffeine has now been discovered to be rebranded as ONNX Store and is found to be managed independently, but the original developer is taking care of the Client support.\n\nThreat actors are currently using this new rebranded platform to target financial institutions through phishing emails.\n\nAdditionally, the ONNX store offers a user-friendly interface that can be accessed via Telegram bots.\n\nFurther, it also has the capabilities to bypass 2FA mechanisms which will increase the success rate of business email compromise attacks.\n\nPhaaS Platform Bypass 2FA\n\nAccording to the reports shared with Cyber Security News, the phishing pages used in these campaigns resemble the original Microsoft 365 login page that will convince any unsuspecting user to enter their authentication credentials.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the rebranding specifically focused on improving operational security for threat actors and their services.\n\nWhile Caffeine kit used a single shared web server for managing all the phishing campaigns, this new ONNX store allows threat actors to control their operations via Telegram bots and support is provided by a support channel.

Further, most of the phishing emails impersonated reputable services like Adobe or Microsoft 365.\n\nEncrypted JS Code To Evade Detection\n\nAdding to its arsenal, this phishing kit also uses an encrypted Javascript code that will only decrypt when the page loads.\n\nThis prevents anti-phishing scanners from detecting these phishing domains.\n\nOnce the JS code decrypts, third-party domains such as \"httbin[.]org\" and \"ipapi[.]co\" collect the victims' network metadata, such as browser name, IP address, and location, before sending it to threat actors.\n\nThe encryption method also hides malicious scripts which follow the below approaches\n\nThese hidden malicious scripts cannot be viewed during a casual inspection. However, if the key and the encrypted string are known, it can be decrypted easily.\n\nHowever, the decrypted JS code was also designed to steal the 2FA token entered by the victims.\n\nBulletproof Hosting For Cybercriminals\n\nThe phishing domains registered have SSL certificates, which GTS CA 1P5 issued from Google Trust Services LLC.\n\nFurther, most of the registered domains were through NameSilo and EVILEMPIRE-AS.\n\nFurther, these bulletproof hosting services enabled cybercriminals an additional layer of anonymity.\n\nIn addition, there were services designed to support a wide range of illegal operations.\n\nThe advertisement on a Telegram group stated that the Bulletproof hosting was under development and they were adding RDP sessions.\n\nFurther, this new ONNX store is also mentioned to support multiple malicious campaigns with high-performance features using enhanced RAM, CPU, and SSD speeds and unlimited bandwidths.", "source": {"uri": "gbhackers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GBHackers On Security"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Neural_Network_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Open Neural Network Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-factor authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloudflare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email spoofing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet hosting service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CAPTCHA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web server"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy server"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet Protocol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Login"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof_hosting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulletproof hosting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain_Names", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Domain Names", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZ88SqT5d6FFkqL1NGs6w0ZfxW0XToenamVeT3ewUQ67Daq-n2fSn3vSzFRu_D48fCVvgN4ADpZiVidofkIzfHBSON6L4XoqFZ2fim-dCagcGIBM3OS43bLko8uU65obrEilq4sY3eeJ5epJGnBsRmjCxDIiexh5NDK9tyqTlRDfph-X3BCYOnsMbtfkuP/s16000/PhaaS%20Platform%20Bypass%202FA%20(1).webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665013", "eventUri": "eng-9665013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Phishing attacks, in particular, increased \"anywhere from 500 to 900%\" over the course of the last 18 months across all industries worldwide.\n\nThese attacks are now targeting the hospitality industry, as crooks rely on AI to mimic authentic emails directed at both travelers and property owners.\n\nCybercriminals can use travel websites for phishing scams due to their nature of asking for credit card information, family details, or personal identification documents. Also, a hotel owner is prone to opening the attachment of a message that could be malware in order to help a supposed guest.\n\nWilking said Booking and other big companies started cooperating while increasingly relying on AI models to stop scammers from posting bogus stays on trusted platforms, preventing and removing the addition of properties that have suspiciously low prices compared to the market standard of the advertised area.\n\nAlso mentioned during the conference was the fact that travel sites have seen the rise of suspected state actors, reportedly from Russia and China, \"trying to cause online mischief or snoop on customers.\"\n\nPhishing and credential stealing can be avoided by using two-factor authentication (2FA) with Booking accounts and any other account. Needless to say, people should not click on anything that looks suspicious and should call the property, hosts, or customer support instead.", "source": {"uri": "technadu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechNadu"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lore_apostol@technadu.com", "name": "Lore Apostol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Identity document"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multi-factor authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.technadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Booking.com-Building-Sign.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665013", "eventUri": "eng-9665013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

where people are tricked into handing over their financial details - since generative AI tools like ChatGPT burst onto the market.\n\n\"Of course, we've had phishing since the dawn of email, but the uptick started shortly after ChatGPT got launched,\" she said.\n\n\"The attackers are definitely using AI to launch attacks that mimic emails far better than anything that they've done to date,\" she said.\n\nPhishing attacks often try to convince people to hand over their card details through by sending them fake - but very convincing looking - internet booking links.\n\nScammers often target websites like Booking.com and Airbnb because they allow people to list their own places to stay\n\nAfter someone pays up, the scammers either vanish without a trace - leaving the buyer without a place to stay - or even try to scam them out of more money through follow-up messages.\n\nThese sorts of scams have been around for decades, though they often come with telltale signs of fraud, such as spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.\n\nScotland fans fume over accommodation 'out of a horror film'\n\nSwift fans scammed over Wembley accommodation\n\nBut - speaking at the Collision technology conference in Toronto - Ms Wilking said AI was making them harder to detect because it could generate realistic images and much more accurate text, in multiple languages.\n\nShe is calling for hotels and travellers to use two-factor authentication - it involves an additional security check, such as inputting a code sent to you phone - calling it \"the best way to combat phishing and credential stealing\".\n\nShe also urged people to more vigilant than before when clicking on links.\n\nBut despite criticising how scammers are using AI, she said the technology was also allowing Booking.com to rapidly remove fake hotels that tried to scam people.\n\n\"We've set up AI models to detect those and either block them from getting on there to begin or take it down before there's any booking,\" she said.\n\nJane Hawkes, a consumer expert specialising in the travel industry, said travel providers should \"step up efforts\" to make people aware of the scams.\n\n\"They also have a responsibility to advise travellers ways to minimise the risk of being scammed,\" she said.\n\nBut she said people should do their research \"with due diligence\" to avoid falling for them in the first place.\n\n\"Check that contact details are readily available on websites and that there is a telephone number - many scam sites purposely don't have one,\" she said.\n\nAnd she also recommended booking package holidays, rather than booking flights and accommodation separately, and to use a credit card to maximise how much you are protected.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booking.com", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Booking.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Package tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multi-factor authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_bbc_articles_618/8604bcfd04cbbf25cc5b6b15995877a3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665013", "eventUri": "eng-9665013", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 92, "textEnd": 99}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The tech allows scammers to craft phishing emails in multiple languages at the same time, leading to a 4151% increase in malicious emails since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022.\n\n\"A threat actor can prompt AI to write an email very quickly, and in any language, with almost zero cost,\" SlashNext CEO Patrick Harr told Decrypt in an interview. \"You will see these [phishing emails] are not just in English only -- I can write in a number of languages and target a number of people in different parts of the world, and I can do it literally within seconds.\"\n\nA recent report by the International Business Times highlighted a sharp increase in phishing attacks targeting both business and leisure travelers with fake website listings and offering massive discounts -- for example, an offering of $200 a night in the Swiss Alps when other sites say $1,000 a night.\n\n\"If there's even a little bit of doubt, call the property, hosts, and customer support,\" Booking.com's chief information security officer Marnie Wilking told IBT.\n\nBooking.com did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nA phishing attack involves messages sent to unsuspecting victims who click on a link that connects to a malicious website or application, tricking users to submit personal or security information, such as passwords.\n\nIn January, cybercriminals targeted crypto email lists using the Mailerlite service, taking over $700,000 from phishing victims.\n\nA newer form of phishing, \"smishing\" or text message phishing, Harr said, is an increasingly popular and dangerous way to attack mobile phones.\n\n\"We have obviously shifted to a mobile world long ago and people are so used to using text messages, and these bad actors always go to where you're comfortable and try to interject themselves,\" Harr said. \"The thing we've seen as a change inside of 'smishing' is it's no longer just a 'click here' because your gift package is on the doorstep.\"\n\nAfter businesses embraced QR codes during the COVID-19 pandemic, Harr said the ubiquitous symbols are now being deployed by scammers.\n\n\"80% of all phones have really no protection at all from phishing,\" Harr said, citing a recent report by Verizon. \"So that's the reason why they're using QR codes -- trying to either get you to pay for something, reveal sensitive information about yourself, or steal your password.\"\n\nWhile phishing attacks remain far and away the most prevalent attack vector used by cybercriminals, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently issued a warning about \"juice jacking,\" which often targets travelers looking to recharge their devices at airports and hotels.\n\nAttackers are taking advantage of the technology built into the universal USB standard, which provides for transmitting power as well as data. A maliciously configured USB port or cable could, when plugged into a victim's device, steal information or install unwanted software.\n\nTo avoid this emerging type of attack, the FCC suggests using personal chargers plugged into basic power outlets, using portable batteries, or using data blockers that ensure a USB connection is limited only to power transfer.\n\nDecrypt reached out to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for more advice.\n\nA CISA spokesperson pointed to resources it provides to help consumers better protect themselves from phishing scams, including recognizing common phishing signs like urgent or emotional language, requests for personal information, and incorrect email addresses.\n\nMisspelled words used to be a clear sign of a phishing attack, but the CISA said this was no longer the case due to the widespread use of AI.\n\n\"This isn't just for summer, this is something people can do all year round to be more secure,\" the CISA spokesperson told Decrypt.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_nelson@decrypt.co", "name": "Jason Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Business Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attack vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_and_Infrastructure_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/juice-jacking_shutterstock_1299399340-gID_7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665013", "eventUri": "eng-9665013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

AI has brought in many benefits, but it has certainly posed serious security risks for consumers and businesses alike, both of which are already grappling to avoid advanced online threats.\n\nAI is well and truly in the cybersecurity spotlight, given it can be used by both attackers and protectors in a multitude of ways. For cyber criminals, they can use AI as a tool to support their attacks and make phishing attempts look more legitimate. AI also significantly enhances targeted attacks like spear phishing. Previously, attackers had to manually select and research targets for susceptibility to social engineering. Now, AI can automate this process, identifying likely victims and crafting convincing phishing lures. This lowers the barrier to entry, allowing even less sophisticated actors to launch effective, lucrative campaigns.\n\nAI also can generate believable deepfake audio and video to help scammers to achieve their goals, and AI even can accelerate exploit development. Traditionally, exploiting software vulnerabilities required high expertise to interpret and exploit CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Now, AI models have been shown to generate exploit code directly from CVEs, speeding up the process and enabling more actors to engage in exploit development, leading to increased data theft and ransomware attacks.\n\nAs AI becomes more pervasive and impactful, society is justifiably becoming more concerned with its implications and unintended consequences. As an AI fan, I want to see it deployed widely in positive ways, but its trust needs to be earned, and whenever bias or misuse occurs and makes the news, that trust is degraded.\n\nTo stay protected online, never share personal information, bank details, or home address with someone you don't know or an organisation you don't fully trust. Use your instincts -- if something feels off, it's better to be cautious and avoid clicking on links that seem suspicious.

Booking.com Warns All Travelers Of AI-Enabled Travel Scams: How To Stay Safe On Your Next Trip - Travel And Tour World", "body": "As summer approaches and travelers eagerly plan their getaways, Booking.com, a leading travel platform, has raised alarms about a surge in AI-enabled travel scams. According to Marnie Wilking, Chief Information Security Officer at Booking.com, the hospitality industry, once considered relatively safe from such attacks, is now a prime target for cybercriminals leveraging advanced AI tools.\n\nNader El Biblawi, Chairman of the Egypt Travel Agent Association, says \"I urge Saudi tour operators and travelers to use Destination Management Companies (DMCs). Relying on online or self-initiated tools does not provide the same level of security and peace of mind as working with professional DMCs. They are well-versed in the region and can offer comprehensive and secure travel experiences. This is my primary message wherever I go in the GCC: use DMCs and travel agencies for your vacations to ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip\".\n\nPhishing scams, where attackers trick victims into revealing sensitive information like login credentials or financial details, have been a persistent threat since the early days of email. However, with the advent of generative AI tools, these attacks have become more sophisticated and harder to detect.\n\nWilking highlighted a staggering increase in phishing attacks, ranging from 500% to 900% across various industries over the past 18 months. She pointed out that AI's ability to generate convincing and grammatically correct messages in multiple languages has greatly enhanced the effectiveness of these scams. This rise in AI-powered phishing poses significant risks to the travel and tourism industry, where sharing credit card details, personal information, and IDs is commonplace.\n\nThe travel and tourism industry offers a lucrative target for cybercriminals. Travelers often book accommodations, tours, and trips online, providing ample opportunities for scammers to exploit. Wilking explained how scammers use AI to craft highly convincing emails and messages that mimic legitimate communications from travel platforms or hospitality providers.\n\nImpact on the Travel Industry:\n\nIn the face of these evolving threats, travelers need to be vigilant and adopt robust security measures to protect their trips from cyber scams. Booking.com and other major companies are increasingly using AI to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, but individual caution is equally crucial.\n\nTips for Safe Travel and Tourism:\n\nBooking.com is at the forefront of using AI to combat these rising threats. The company has developed sophisticated AI models to detect and block fake property listings before they can trick users. By analyzing patterns and behaviors, these models can identify potential scams and remove them from the platform swiftly.\n\nAdvanced AI Tools for Security:\n\nWhile companies like Booking.com are investing heavily in AI and other technologies to protect users, travelers themselves play a crucial role in ensuring their safety. By adopting safe practices and staying informed about potential threats, travelers can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to AI-enabled scams.\n\nBest Practices for Travelers:\n\nAs AI technology continues to evolve, so too will the tactics of cybercriminals. The travel and tourism industry must remain vigilant and adaptable to counter these emerging threats. The use of AI for both defensive and offensive purposes in cybersecurity will likely become more prevalent.\n\nAI's Dual Role in Travel Security:\n\nThe rise of AI-enabled travel scams presents a serious challenge for the travel and tourism industry. As these threats become more sophisticated, it's essential for both companies and travelers to adopt proactive measures to protect their data and ensure safe and enjoyable travel experiences.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAs you plan your next trip, whether it's for tourism, a tour, or a business engagement, keep these security tips in mind to safeguard your journey from the growing threat of AI-enabled travel scams.

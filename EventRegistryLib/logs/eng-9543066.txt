Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman To Announce Three-Day Week off Policy in 2024 Budget of Modi Government? PIB Fact Check Reveals Truth About Viral Image.\n\nShe said that GST, which was first mooted by the erstwhile Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government, was ultimately implemented under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the necessary consensus was carefully built, and the GST Acts were passed by the Parliament in 2016. She also said that in 10 years, the UPA was unable to achieve political consensus on GST.\n\nThe Finance Minister said that before the implementation of GST, India's indirect tax system was fragmented and complicated, and every state was practically a distinct market in itself with different rules and tax rates. Inputs for Central excise duty, etc., could not be availed, leading to an increased tax burden on the common people, she said.\n\nThe GST streamlined 17 taxes and 13 cesses into a five-tier structure, simplifying the tax regime. The turnover threshold for registration rose to Rs 40 lakh for goods and Rs 20 lakh for services (from Rs 5 lakh on average under VAT). The GST also reduced 495 different submissions (challan, forms, declarations, etc) across states to just 12, she explained. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman Accuses Tamil Nadu Government of Banning Ayodhya Ram Mandir Live Telecast on January 22, Labels Actions as Anti-Hindu.\n\nThe GST simplified compliances through uniform processes, simple registration, single returns, and a fully IT-driven system with minimal physical interface, she added. The Quarterly Returns with Monthly Payment (QRMP) scheme, with much lower compliances, has benefited over 44 lakh small taxpayers and MSMEs. As per a Deloitte survey (2023), 88 per cent of MSMEs credit GST for cost reductions along with optimised supply chains.\n\nThe GST regime has enhanced MSME financing through tools like e-invoicing, TReDS, and the Account Aggregator framework. The number of registered taxpayers under the GST grew to over 1.4 crore from 65 lakh in 2017, the Finance Minister said.\n\nThe E-way bill system removed inter-state checkpoints, reducing logistics costs. Trucks travelled 44 per cent more daily, and corruption at tax 'nakas' decreased. Consequently, domestic goods' inter-state trade surged to 35 per cent of GDP in FY22, up from 23.5 per cent in FY18, she pointed out.\n\nThe Finance Minister said, \"Reflecting a pro-poor approach, the effective weighted average GST rate has consistently fallen since 2017. The Revenue Neutral Rate was suggested to be 15.3 per cent but was lower at 14.4 per cent in 2017, and it has come down to 11.6 per cent in 2019.\" The GST lowered taxes on many essential items compared to pre-GST rates. Common items like hair oil and soaps saw tax being cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent.\n\nElectrical appliances are taxed at 12 per cent against 31.5 per cent before. Movie tickets were taxed lower, too. Further tax rate rationalisation has been done since 2017. The National Anti-profiteering Authority has ensured that companies passed the benefits to the consumers, FM Sitharaman said.\n\nThe Finance Minister also cited the fact that GST has exempted many essential items and services, such as unbranded food items, certain life-saving drugs, healthcare, education, public transport, sanitary napkins, hearing aid parts, and agricultural services to drive home her point.\n\nShe also said that GST exemplifies cooperative federalism in India besides empowering the states.\n\nThe GST Council, with a 75 per cent majority vote requirement, assigns one-third voting power to the Centre and two-thirds to the states. Out of the 52 meetings, all decisions but one were reached through consensus. \"As the Chairperson of the GST Council, I have ensured that the voices of all states are heard equally without bias,\" she said.\n\n\"It is a myth that all GST collections are pocketed by the Centre. GST contributes significantly to state revenues -- states receive 100 per cent of the SGST collected in a particular state, and approx. 50 per cent of IGST (i.e. on inter-state trade). A significant portion of CGST, i.e., 42 per cent, is devolved to the the states based on the Finance Commission's recommendations,\" the Finance Minister pointed out. She also cited figures to show that GST has improved tax buoyancy from 0.72 (pre-GST) to 1.22 (2018-23). Despite compensation ending, state revenues remain buoyant at 1.15.\n\nThe Finance Minister also said that without GST, states' revenue from subsumed taxes from FY 18-19 to 2023-24 would have been Rs 37.5 lakh crore. With GST, the states' actual revenue amounted to Rs. 46.56 lakh crore.\n\nShe said that despite the GST rate being less than the prescribed Revenue Neutral Rate, and the Covid pandemic affecting the revenues, GST collections (as a percentage of GDP) have now reached the levels they were before GST (both net and gross). This demonstrates that the Centre and the states, collectively through better tax administration, are able to collect the same revenue with a lower burden on the taxpayers.\n\n\"GST is an expression of Modi government's commitment to'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayaas'. Our continuous efforts are towards ensuring that new heights are scaled through better taxpayer services and increased efficiencies instead of increased taxes,\" FM Sitharaman said.", "source":

Common items like hair oil and soaps saw tax cuts from 28 per cent to 18 per cent \"\n\nShe also highlighted the two recent achievements in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) architecture.\n\nShe emphasized the GST collection crossing of Rs 2 lakh crore and the appointment of the President of the GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) as a significant milestone.\n\nIn her post, she also shared about the history of GST by crediting former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee led the NDA government for initiating the idea and credited PM Narendra Modi for its implementation. She also highlighted the complexities of India's pre-GST indirect tax system, emphasizing the fragmented market and varied tax rates across states.\n\n\"Before GST, India's indirect tax system was fragmented & complicated, and every state was practically a distinct market in itself with different rules and tax rates. Inputs for central excise duty, etc, could not be availed, leading to an increased tax burden for the common people. - GST streamlined 17 taxes and 13 cesses into a 5-tier structure, simplifying the tax regime\" said the post.\n\nShe also highlighted the positive outcomes of GST, including enhanced MSME financing, reduced logistics costs through the E-way bill system, and increased interstate trade.\n\nUnion minister also emphasized the pro-poor approach of GST, with consistently falling effective weighted average GST rates since 2017.\n\nFurthermore, Sitharaman stressed the cooperative federalism aspect of GST, empowering states through the GST council's decision-making process. She debunked the myth that all GST collections are pocketed by the Centre, highlighting the significant contribution to state revenues.\n\n\"It is a myth that all GST collections are pocketed by the Centre. GST contributes significantly to state revenues - States receive 100% of SGST collected in that state, approx. 50 per cent of IGST (i.e. on inter-state trade). A significant portion of CGST, i.e., 42 per cent, is devolved to the states based on the Finance Commission's recommendations\" said the post.\n\n\"Without GST, states' revenue from subsumed taxes from FY 18-19 to 2023-24 would have been Rs. 37.5 lakh crore. With GST, states' actual revenue amounted to Rs. 46.56 lakh crore\" it further added.\n\nThe Minister said \"Despite the GST rate being less than the prescribed Revenue Neutral Rate and COVID-19 affecting the revenues, GST collections (as a % of GDP) have now reached the levels they were before GST (both net and gross). This demonstrates that the Centre & States, collectively, through better tax administration, are able to collect the same revenue with a lower burden on our taxpayers\".\n\nAt the end, the post concluded by adding \"GST is an expression of Modi Govt's commitment to'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayaas'. Our continuous efforts are towards ensuring that new heights are scaled through better taxpayer services and increased efficiencies instead of increased taxes\".

With GST, states' actual revenue amounted to \u20b946.56 lakh crore,\" she said on social media. The FM was underlining two major milestones -- First, collection from GST exceeded \u20b92 lakh crore in April. Second, with the appointment of retired Justice Sanjaya Kumar Mishra as President, the formation of GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) was set in motion.\n\nThe government introduced GST on July 1, 2017, by subsuming 17 taxes and 13 cesses administered by the Centre and States/Union Territories with the legislature. The FM said GST has improved tax buoyancy from 0.72 (pre-GST) to 1.22 (2018-23). Despite compensation ending, state revenues remain buoyant at 1.15. \"Despite the GST rate being less than the prescribed Revenue Neutral Rate and Covid-19 affecting the revenues, GST collections (as a percentage of GDP) have now reached the levels they were before GST (both net and gross),\" she said.\n\nThis remark appears to be in response to former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian's assertion earlier this month that the April GST number (\u20b92.1 lakh crore.) is a record, but the focus must be on revenues, net of refunds, not on headline collections. \"Despite recovery from the pandemic & better implementation, GST revenue for FY24 @ 6.1 % of GDP has still (after 7 years) not surpassed pre-GST level,\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\nMeanwhile, the FM said that she has ensured all states' voices are equally heard without bias. \"It is a myth that all GST collections are pocketed by the Centre. GST contributes significantly to state revenues - States receive 100 per cent of SGST collected in that state, approx. 50 per cent of IGST (i.e. on inter-state trade). A significant portion of CGST, i.e., 42 per cent, is devolved to the states based on the Finance Commission's recommendations,\" she explained.\n\nThe Minister also highlighted that the effective weighted average GST rate has consistently fallen since 2017. The Revenue Neutral Rate was suggested to be 15.3 per cent but was lower at 14.4 per cent in 2017, and it has come down to 11.6 per cent in 2019. GST lowered taxes on many essential items compared to pre-GST rates. Common items like hair oil and soaps saw tax cut to 18 per cent from 28 per cent. Electrical appliances taxed at 12 per cent v/s 31.5% per cent before. Movie tickets were taxed lower, too.\n\nTaking note of number of registered GST assesses to over 1.4 crore from 65 lakhs during pre GST regime, she said this has happened despite the turnover threshold for registration rose to \u20b940 lakh for goods and \u20b920 Lakh for services (from \u20b95 lakh on average under VAT). GST also reduced 495 different submissions (challan, forms, declarations, etc) across states to just 12.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 6, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goods and Services Tax (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjaya_Kumar_Mishra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanjaya Kumar Mishra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cess", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Subramanian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Subramanian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/j8st4q/article68146464.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2501_27_4_2024_17_43_51_4_SRR_0033.JPEG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543066", "eventUri": "eng-9543066", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-01", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 732}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

This not only indicates improvement in economic activity, but also that most opposition-ruled states have more revenue at their disposal contrary to their claims.\n\nExplaining with figures in a long post on social media, union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: \"Two significant milestones were reached in the larger GST architecture. The President of the GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) has been appointed & gross GST collections crossed a landmark of Rs 2 lakh crore - thanks to heightened economic activity. This post is divided into three parts. The first part explores the origins of GST and its role in streamlining the Indirect tax system. The second part discusses how GST has benefitted people through a pro-poor approach. The third part underscores GST's role in promoting cooperative & fiscal federalism...\"\n\nThe opposition, particularly the Congress and its senior leader Rahul Gandhi, has been attacking the government calling the GST 'Babbar tax' and has promised to remove it if the party comes to power. But, the figures show that this tax has helped states more than it has the Centre. Sources said armed with these figures, which also show that states have benefitted, the Centre can now counter allegations coming from state governments like West Bengal, Telangana and Karnataka that they have been deprived of funds.\n\nIn the third part of her post, Sitharaman said it is a myth that all GST collections are pocketed by the Centre. \"Cooperative Federalism in India, empowering states. The @GST_Council, with a 75% majority vote requirement, assigns one-third voting power to the Centre & two-thirds to states. It is a myth that all GST collections are pocketed by the Centre. GST contributes significantly to state revenues - States receive 100% of SGST collected in that state, approx. 50% of IGST (i.e. on inter-state trade). A significant portion of CGST, i.e., 42%, is devolved to the states based on the Finance Commission's recommendations. Without GST, states' revenue from subsumed taxes from FY 18-19 to 2023-24 would have been Rs. 37.5 lakh crore. With GST, states' actual revenue amounted to Rs. 46.56 lakh crore...\" she wrote.\n\nThe minister further said GST is an expression of the Narendra Modi-led government's commitment to 'Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas, sabka prayaas'. She added that through the GST Council, both central and state governments should collectively strive to make the system more taxpayer-friendly to meet the prime minister's vision of a 'Viksit Bharat'.\n\nIn the first part of her post, she said: \"Before GST, India's indirect tax system was fragmented with every state practically a distinct market in itself with different rules and tax rates. Inputs for central excise duty, etc, could not be availed, leading to an increased tax burden for the common people.

The Revenue Neutral Rate was suggested to be 15.3% but was lower at 14.4% in 2017, and it has come down to 11.6% in 2019,\" Ms. Sitharaman postulated.\n\n\"Further tax rate rationalization has been done since 2017. National Anti-profiteering Authority ensured that companies passed the benefits to the consumers. GST has exempted many essential items and services, such as unbranded food items, certain life-saving drugs, healthcare, education, public transport, sanitary napkins, hearing aid parts, agricultural services, etc,\" she pointed out.\n\nNoting that the idea of GST was first mooted under the Atal Behari Vajpayee-led NDA government, Ms. Sitharaman said that the UPA government was unable to achieve political consensus on its implementation, while the necessary compact was \"carefully built\" under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership.\n\n\"Before GST, India's indirect tax system was fragmented and complicated, and every state was practically a distinct market in itself with different rules and tax rates. Inputs for central excise duty, etc, could not be availed, leading to an increased tax burden for the common people,\" Ms. Sitharaman said in a statement. The GST streamlined 17 taxes and 13 cesses into a 5-tier structure, and reduced 495 submissions and filings across States to just 12, simplifying the tax regime, she said.\n\nStressing that GST simplified compliances through uniform processes, simple registration, single returns, and a fully IT-driven system with minimal physical interface, Ms. Sitharaman cited a survey that found 88% of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) credited the tax for reducing costs and optimising supply chains.\n\nWhile the number of registered taxpayers under GST grew to over 1.4 crore from 65 lakh in 2017, 44 lakh small taxpayers and MSMEs have utilised the Quarterly Returns with Monthly Payment (QRMP) scheme that entails much lower compliances, she said.\n\n\"GST has enhanced MSME financing through tools like e-invoicing, TReDS, and the Account Aggregator framework,\" the minister emphasised, adding that the E-way bill system removed inter-state checkpoints and lowered logistics costs.\n\n\"Trucks travelled 44% more daily, and corruption at tax 'nakas' decreased. Consequently, domestic goods' inter-state trade surged to 35% of GDP in 2021-22, up from 23.5% in 2017-18,\" Ms. Sitharaman said.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services_tax_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services tax (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goods and Services Tax (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Progressive_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Progressive Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indirect tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cess", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/business/Economy/k0n6ry/article68146433.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20240420049L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543066", "eventUri": "eng-9543066", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 145, "textEnd": 150}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

All the other essential commodities should be fully exempted under GST.\"\n\nAll processed and value-added manufactured food products and other goods of importance should be brought under the 5% GST rate, he said. All other Goods and Services should attract a GST rate of 10%. Luxurious goods should be taxed at 15% and sin goods may be changed at a much higher rate restricting consumption, it added.\n\nThe benefits of Input Tax Credit (ITC) should neither be denied nor restricted to any assesse, as this will lessen the cascading effect on the price due to tax on tax. In consultation with Trade and Industry, the GST Act and Rules should be simplified to reduce the cost of compliance, said the AFCCI.\n\nTherefore, the Chamber requested the new Union Government to be formed in June 2024, to take up the next generation of GST reforms to accelerate the growth of our economy towards 'Developed India'.", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "dtNext.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services_tax_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services tax (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goods and Services Tax (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indirect tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_exemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax exemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value added"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://dtnext-prod.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/h-upload/2024/05/04/820606-gst.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543066", "eventUri": "eng-9543066", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madurai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

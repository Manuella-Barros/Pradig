Other athletes came over to try and calm down the confrontation, which was done in front of the world's cameras.\n\nFootage from the incident appears to show Hay and Mills tussling as the runners went on to the final straight.\n\nMills can then be seen falling alongside three others while runners fought for track position.\n\nHay finished seventh and qualified for the final, with Mills furious in a post-run interview.\n\nWhen asked by media after the run what he said to Hay, Mills said: \"I'm probably not allowed to say. I haven't seen anyone but there'll be an appeal, I hope.\n\n\"It was a perfect qualifier for me. I was thinking nobody in this field can keep up with me and then bang hit the deck. But what can you do?\"\n\nFollowing the race, it has been confirmed that Mills has been advanced to Saturday's final.\n\nLobalu and Foppen have also been put in the race.\n\nA statement from British Athletics on X says: \"Following this morning's 5000m heat, George Mills has been advanced to Saturday's final.\"\n\nHay was not disqualified.

I got taken out.\"\n\nAsked what he had said to Hay, Mills said: \"I'm probably not allowed to say.\" Mills confirmed that he wanted Team GB to appeal, with officials having the ability to reinstate athletes if they are deemed not at fault.\n\nIt was subsequently confirmed that the footage was studied by the officials and they ruled in favour of Mills and allowed all of the four fallers - Mills, Ndikumwenayo, Poppen and Lobalu - into Saturday night's final.\n\nThe BBC commentators Paula Radcliffe and Steve Cram thought that Mills, and those who had fallen, had paid for allowing the pace to drop so much during the race.\n\n\"If you choose to jog around that slowly, and people fall, it's kind of your own fault,\" said Radcliffe. \"When there are that many people around I'm not sure you are going to be able to say, 'I had somebody trip me up'. There were too many men there because nobody took it on.\"\n\nSeeing the pictures of Mills confronting Hay, Cram added: \"No.... Paula is right to some extent, with the exception of Nordas, most of them have got themselves to blame.\n\n\"George was in a bad position from a long way out. He should have checked out much earlier. George, from what I could see, did do a do big push there in the home straight.\"\n\nThe after-race confrontation involving Mills and Hay drew immediate comparisons with the British runner's father and an infamous clash with Robbie Savage during their days playing for Middlesbourhg and Birmingham City respectively.\n\nThere was then almost another major collision in the second heat when a cameraman, who was focussed on the javelin, wandered obliviously onto the track and within centimetres of a pack of runners.\n\nJakob Ingebrigtsen, fresh from his shock fourth place in the men's 1500m last night, gestured to the cameraman and had to swerve into one of the middle lanes to miss him. He won the heat and will take his place in the final of a distance in which he has won the last two World Championships.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Hay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugo Hay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Ndikumwenayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Ndikumwenayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ahmed_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Ahmed (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Radcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paula Radcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5000_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5000 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Javelin throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbie Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xwhLZQIN5g.MjureKyBYrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/23157736974c67f829a7fed5bc769cb1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797475", "eventUri": "eng-9797475", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

I got stepped out on as I was about to kick in the home straight and boom, a French lad took me down.\"\n\nAfter Mills was asked what he had said in frustration to Hay, he responded: \"I'm probably not allowed to say, but yeah, said I'd... yeah.\"\n\nHe then discussed whether he had been able to lodge a complaint with any Olympics officials yet.\n\nMills continued: \"I haven't seen anyone, but I'm pretty sure that BA will be on it and put an appeal in, I hope.

The French guy took me out.\"\n\nAll four runners involved in the collision duly lodged successful appeals, meaning they will be permitted to compete in the 5000m final.\n\nHe added: \"It looks like my path was maybe stopped. Mo Ahmed went down with 800m to go and I just about managed to hurdle him, so I thought I'd got away with one there, but then going into the home straight on the last lap, I was tucked in on the inside, where I wanted to be, because I knew some sort of gap would open up. It did and I was ready to put my foot down and all of a sudden, boom, I hit the deck.\n\n\"I was ready to go. If we look at the top pace of the race, it was playing into a 1500m guys hands, so that was my plan. Get around the whole race, sit in and don't waste any energy, get into the last 100m, doesn't matter if you are 10th or 12th, you will be able to come past.\n\n\"We executed that to the point, and I was ready to execute that last little bit, but that got taken out of my control unfortunately.\"\n\nHay, who finished seventh in the race well ahead of the quartet who were involved in the tangle of legs, was also interviewed by Eurosport and voiced his innocence in the fall. He said: \"There was a big collision, it's not me. Somebody pushed me, something happened and I turned around and everyone was on the floor. I hope it wasn't me. I did really well.\"\n\nFormer Team GB runner Allison Curbishley questioned Mills' tactics on BBC Radio 5 Live however, saying: \"George Mills has done this so many times, he doesn't put himself in the best of positions.

That meant that all of the runners remained bunched up throughout the race as they ran the risk of stumbling or falling over at a crucial moment.\n\nAs the race entered its final two laps, that's exactly what happened, as Canada's Mohammed Ahmed tripped and fell to the floor ahead of the decisive lap.\n\nREAD MORE: Team GB Olympics star forced to fly home and return to full-time day job immediately\n\nWhile he battled to rejoin the main group, however, there was more drama yet to come as a huge collision on the home straight saw four more athletes - including Team GB's George Mills - fall to the floor. The Dutch runner, Mike Foppen, was also caught up in the clash as he fell forward and landed on his head before getting up and finishing the race alongside Mills.\n\nAs the runners composed themselves after a crazy end to the race, a furious Mills was not about to let it lie as he marched over to his rival Hugo Hay of France - who qualified - to confront him. Pointing at the Frenchman and shouting in his direction, he then raised his hand to his chest and shoved him backwards.\n\nA stunned Andrew Cotter, on commentary duties for the BBC, couldn't believe what he had seen as he tried to unpick the \"chaos and carnage\" of the last two laps.\n\nAs he watched Mills confront Hay, Cotter said: \"I'm not sure you can react like this. Hugo Hay is trying to calm him down.\" Steve Cram added: \"With the exception of [race winner] Narve Gilje Nordas, they've only got themselves to blame. George was in a bad position from a long way out, he should have checked out much earlier.\"\n\nFollowing the race, a fuming Mills spoke to the BBC as he explained: \"I think it's pretty clear [what happened].

The 25-year-old clipped the legs of a runner next to him, lost his balance and fell over, with three others also going down.\n\nThe first heat of the 5000m was run at a slow pace, meaning the field had not been stretched out coming into the closing stages. That left a huge bunch of athletes straining for the finish line - and ultimately ended in chaos.\n\nThe incident follows disappointment in the 1500m for Mills, who finished 11th in the semi-finals to miss out on the finals. Speaking afterwards, the Harrogate runner admitted that fatigue was a problem after three days of straight racing.\n\n\"I knew my back was up against the wall a little bit,\" he said. \"With messing up in the first round and having to run the repechage, that's made it three days on a row.

Joe Ingles has signaled for a while that this would be his final Boomers campaign,\" Uluc claimed.\n\nMills is fifth in all-time Olympic scoring, behind Argentina native Luis Scola. At 35, Mills carreid the Australia to the best of his ability with 26 points on 11-21 shooting from the field and 2-5 from behind the three-point line, and two steals for good measure. If such stats weren't enough, Mills hit a jump shot to force overtime vs. the surging Serbia Olympic team.\n\nUnfortuntely for Australia, such heroics didn't amount to a victory.\n\nMills postgame comments read as someone ready to kick his feet up and remember the good times.\n\n\"We just enjoy every moment of this journey,\" Mills said after the loss against Serbia. \"Hasn't been the smoothest sailing ship, but we do it together and never take those moments for granted.\"\n\nAlthough Australia gave up an historic lead, Mills walks away with pride intact as he did what he could to lead his team to a quarterfinals matchup with Germany.

Cory Mills is denying accusations of misrepresenting his four-year military career, sharing documents he says prove his record of heroic Army service.\n\nMills, a first-term congressman representing Florida's 7th District, is facing an Aug. 20 Republican primary challenge from Michael Johnson, a retired Department of Defense employee and Vietnam-era Army veteran from Altamonte Springs.\n\nWhile campaigning, Johnson is handing voters flyers that ask: \"Why does Mills lie about his military service? ... He is committing Stolen Valor.\"\n\nThe term \"stolen valor\" refers to people who make false claims about serving in the armed forces or their military record.\n\nIn particular, Johnson and other critics challenge Mills' claim of earning a Bronze Star medal.\n\nMills -- who won a wide-open 2022 Republican primary -- has provided The News-Journal with several documents he says prove he served in Iraq in 2003 and earned a Bronze Star with heroism. Also, a seriously wounded soldier's mother says Mills was her son's team leader and was in Iraq, as Mills contends.\n\n\"I'm tired of the slander and the defamation,\" Mills said. \"I ran for office to be able to serve the American people, not to defend something I did 20 years ago over and over and over.\"\n\nMills is a loyal supporter of former President Donald Trump, who in a 2022 endorsement called the congressman a \"wonderful patriot\" and \"a great fighter for our Country.\" Mills' help in evacuating Americans out of dangerous foreign lands in Afghanistan in 2021, Israel in 2023 and Haiti earlier this year, have gotten him national media attention, as has his analysis as a former sniper after Trump survived an assassination attempt on June 13.\n\nThe News-Journal made a Freedom of Information request to the Army for Mills' Official Military Personnel File and DD Form 214, a document summarizing a soldier's service upon discharge from active duty -- on July 15. The documents have yet to be provided to the newspaper, but some have previously been given to Johnson. The News-Journal has confirmed some of the records provided to Johnson are legitimate, as is a medal-confirmation memo Mills shared.\n\nForm shows Bronze Star, but no foreign service\n\nThe DD 214 lists the Bronze Star among the award Mills earned in four years of active duty, ending in 2003. But it contains other errors, Mills said, which critics have used to raise questions about the document.\n\nThey point to section of the document shows no days of foreign service and raise questions about other records Mills has provided.\n\n\"It's very suspicious. It's really red flags,\" Johnson said.\n\nWill Kern, who served more than five years on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps and nearly another three in the Marine Corps Reserves, knows Mills from their time working together for international security contractor DynCorp. He said he and coworkers had questions about Mills' background then, and still do. He called Mills' DD 214 \"very strange.\"\n\n\"I was heartbroken, as well, to tell you the truth. Having been a former special operator, I know what these men went through to achieve these goals and what these guys have endured, the ones that have been recipients of Bronze Stars and Silver Stars, so just to find out that all of this has just been a lie, it's just ... it's mind-blowing,\" Kern said.\n\nJohnson, Kern and others have been contributing documents to the website corymillswatch.com, launched earlier this year by Altamonte Springs businesswoman Jade Murray.\n\nMurray said she received a cease-and-desist letter dated June 11.\n\n\"I did receive one letter from a lawyer and I responded to it, and they never responded back. And a lot of what was stated in that letter (weren't claims I made on the site),\" she said. \"I've really been very, very careful to not make any claims that I can't back up.\"\n\nFor example, Murray said the attorney accused her of stating that Mills was never deployed.\n\n\"I never claimed he wasn't deployed. I stated what his documents say, that he didn't have any combat.\n\nSkeptic calls for photos of Mills in Iraq in 2003\n\nKern, who lives in Houston, has gone so far as to offer a reward for photographic evidence of Mills' time in Iraq.\n\n\"We are serious: If you can find someone with a picture of Cory Mills in a U.S. military/Armed Forces uniform in Iraq or Afghanistan, we will pay $1,000,\" Kern wrote in an email. \"It was the most photographed war in our lifetime, and not one picture or video of Cory in uniform, deployed overseas with the U.S. military, has ever been found.\"\n\nAfter hearing about the reward, Mills texted two photos to The News-Journal, writing, \"Get your $1,000.\"\n\nAfter looking at the photos and sharing them with others, Kern said he believes the photos were taken during training for the 82nd Airborne medical team in Failaka Island off the coast of Kuwait. Kern said producing a photo of himself in Iraq or Afghanistan with personal protective equipment and a weapon \"shouldn't be a hard request for a hardened, combat Bronze Star recipient.\"\n\nMills has also countered the stolen valor allegations by providing The News-Journal with a copy of his Form 638, the paperwork requesting that Mills receive a Bronze Star, as well as a July 11 Army letter confirming Mills had received the Bronze Star, the Combat Medical Badge and two Global War on Terrorism medals.\n\nMills served in the Army from 1999-2003\n\nMills, 44, is originally from Winter Haven. He is a registered Florida voter at a New Smyrna Beach address and won his congressional seat in 2022. Florida's 7th District includes Seminole and southern Volusia counties.\n\nHe enlisted in the Army in July 1999, when he was 19. He earned an honorable discharge in August 2003, fulfilling his commitment. When he left, he was a member of the Headquarters Company, 1st Division of the 325th Infantry Regiment, part of the 82nd Airborne Division. In March 2003, the 325th took part in the invasion of Iraq.\n\nMills' DD 214 shows he earned a Bronze Star, a Kosovo Campaign medal and expert marksmanship, combat medical, expert field medical and parachute badges. The document also indicates Mills had 0 days of foreign service.\n\nMills says there were errors on his DD 214, which he did not sign, adding he didn't have time to review the document while he was being transitioned off his base. Errors on a DD 214 are \"common,\" Mills said.\n\nMills explained the portion of the document showing no foreign service, saying that line typically does not include deployments overseas, only assignments at bases in Germany, Korea and elsewhere.\n\nSome of Mills' skeptics disagree, saying deployments are usually included as part of the foreign service accounting.\n\nArmy reviews Mills' medals, including Bronze Star\n\nMills claims on his campaign website that he is a \"decorated U.S. Army combat veteran.\"\n\nSome of the skeptics argue Mills couldn't have been awarded a Bronze Star because his records show no foreign service. They question whether he even served in Iraq in 2003.\n\nMills provided The News-Journal two additional documents that he says debunks \"stolen valor\" claims.\n\nThe first came as a result of a review of Mills' medals. Mills said the review came at his request, as he was looking for additional backup to his DD 214 showing he earned the Bronze Star.\n\nThe Army reviewed all of Mills' medals, he said, because the staff discovered he had not been given the Global War on Terror Service Medal or Expeditionary Medal.\n\nWhen Johnson requested Mills' DD 214, the Army redacted the section listing medals.\n\nIn an April 23 letter to Johnson, Col. Christopher Ruga, chief of staff of the Army Human Resources Center at Fort Knox, Kentucky, wrote: \"We have become aware that there may be some inaccurate information in (Mills' Official Military Personnel File) concerning awards, and we are reviewing the records to resolve this issue.\"\n\nAdditionally, sometime in March, a mention of the Bronze Star was edited out of Mills' official Congress biography. Mills told The News-Journal the omission was likely an error as his bio was rewritten to reflect his first year in office.\n\nWhen the Army's review of the medals was complete, a memo signed on behalf of Lt. Col. Damian Tong, chief of the Awards and Decorations Branch, dated July 11 states Mills earned a Bronze Star, a combat medical badge, a Global War on Terrorism service medal and a Global War on Terrorism expeditionary medal.\n\nBill Costello, an Army deputy public affairs officer, confirmed in a separate email that Tong had written the memo in response to the review mentioned by Ruga.\n\nRetired general confirms signing Mills' Bronze Star recommendation\n\nMills furnished The News-Journal with a Form 638, the recommendation for him to earn the Bronze Star. While it shows that he earned the medal and details why, Johnson and others have questions, including the date the form was signed.\n\nArmy Brig. Cmdr. Arnold N. G. Bray's signature is on the Form 638. On one line, Bray's title is listed as brigade commander. On another, it refers to him as\" \"BG (R),\" meaning brigadier general (retired). According to his LinkedIn page and several bios, Bray retired in 2012.\n\nBray himself told The News-Journal that he did sign a recommendation for Mills, but neither he nor Mills answered the question of when it was signed.\n\n\"Cory was one of my (non-commissioned officers) and I awarded all my squad leaders and above the Bronze Star,\" Bray wrote in a text message recently. \"To be clear. Without exception, my soldiers and especially my NCOs were doing things (whereby) uncommon was common.\"\n\nBray also wrote that Mills' actions justifying the award are \"ordinarily submitted by the observing individuals. To be clear, I am not validating any of the specifics.\"\n\nFormer Army soldier Bobby Oller, who served in the 325th from 2002 to 2006, says the bottom of the Form 638 shows that it was created in \"Apr 2021.\"\n\n''We all know he had to have this document made after 2021,\" Oller said.\n\nBoth Oller and Johnson say they have spoken to several members of the 325th and has found no one who recalls Mills.\n\nKern wrote: \"Why is it, after all of these years of asking Cory about his military service, all of a sudden he is producing half-assed documents that look ... photoshopped. Why is he sending out 'evidence' that doesn't prove anything?\"\n\nAnother key portion of the 638 is the back and additional pages which would show other Army officials -- including the nominating party -- signing off on the award. Mills said he did not have the remaining pages.\n\n'Extraordinary heroism and unwavering dedication'\n\nThe Form 638 gives five justifications for Mills to receive the Bronze Star.\n\n\"Sgt. Mills distinguished himself by displaying extraordinary heroism and unwavering dedication to duty as an Emergency Medical Treatment Specialist,\" the document states. \"Throughout numerous combat operations, he repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire to provide life-saving medical care to wounded coalition forces and civilians.\"\n\nThe document states Mills was involved in \"multiple grueling campaigns,\" fighting in Baghdad, Fallujah, Somalu and \"innumerable other towns and villages across Iraq.\"\n\nWhile in Baghdad, Mills' unit aided a fellow U.S. unit that \"was pinned down by intense enemy fire.\" A sergeant had been grabbed by an enemy.\n\n\"Jumping into action, Sgt. Mills threw himself at the enemy insurgent and subdued him, saving the life (of the sergeant),\" the document states.\n\nAlso, Mills \"selflessly shared his knowledge and expertise with junior medical personnel, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the unit.\"\n\nWas Mills involved in Iraq rescue of soldiers?\n\nThe remaining justification provides specifics placing Mills in a particular place and time.\n\nIt credits Mills with helping to save the lives of then-Pvt. Alan Babin Jr., and Pvt. Joe Heit, in a much-retold story dating to March 31, 2003, shortly after the start of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nBabin was assigned to the headquarters company of the 1st Battalion of the 325th Infantry as a medic.\n\nHe was attached to the 3rd Platoon, Company A, which was positioned in As-Samawah, a city in southwestern Iraq, when Pvt. Joe Heit was injured by gunfire. Babin -- who would earn a Purple Heart and Bronze Star with a V device for valor -- went to help and was seriously wounded, shot in the stomach.\n\nMills said he was there and aided in the rescue of Babin. His Form 638 states:\n\n\"Sgt. Mills, while under intense enemy fire, came to the aid of two fallen comrades, Corporal Babin and Pvt. Heit, who had been struck by enemy fire. At great risk to his own life, he applied emergency life-saving medical care to both soldiers and assisted in their evacuation back to U.S. Forces, saving the lives of both soldiers.\"\n\nRosie Babin, Alan Babin's mother, confirmed Mills was in Iraq with her son.\n\n\"Sgt. Mills was my son, Cpl. Alan Babin's team leader. He was in Iraq and there with my son in As-Samawah when Alan was shot,\" Rosie Babin said in a text message Friday. \"We are still to this day dealing with the effects of that day.\"\n\nMills said the stolen valor accusations have forced him to relive painful memories, such as the day before the As-Samawah mission, when Babin told him he didn't have a good feeling.\n\n\"I told him, 'Suck it up. This is what we do. Stop trying to think it. Let's go for it,' and he was one of the first (expletive) people hit,\" Mills said. \"So, yeah, there's a little bit of guilt about that.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.news-journalonline.com", "dataType":

This announcement came just after Australia's gripping 95-90 overtime loss to Serbia in the semi-finals of the 2024 Paris Olympics, where Mills captivated audiences with late-game heroics, including a clutch jumper over Serbian star Nikola Joki\u0107. In the loss, Mills scored 26 points and recorded three assists and two steals.\n\nPatty Mills reflects on a distinguished international career with Australia after loss to Serbia at 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nOn the court, Mills proved a formidable presence, averaging 16.5 points and 1.5 steals this tournament, shooting 41.4% from the field and 40.9% from beyond the arc. His final Olympic campaign, marking his fifth Olympic participation, featured a series of electrifying performances that highlighted his vital role in the team.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Mills has been a pivotal figure in Australian basketball, making significant contributions to his team's four gold medals at the FIBA Oceania Championship. His crowning achievement came at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics where he not only served as a flag bearer but also led Australia to its first-ever men's Olympic medal. In a dramatic bronze medal game against Slovenia, Mills delivered an inspirational 42-point performance, securing a historic victory for his team.\n\nReflecting on his career after the loss to Serbia, Mills shared, \"Through the happy tears and the sad tears, it's been an incredible journey.\" His words deeply resonated, emphasizing the emotional depth of his decision to retire and the profound impact of his time on the court.\n\nAustralia navigates Olympic future in Post-Mills Era\n\nAs Australia and the basketball community reflect on Patty Mills' contributions, they firmly establish his legacy as one of the sport's greats. His departure from the international stage marks the end of an era for Australian basketball, yet his influence will continue to inspire future generations.\n\nLooking forward, Australia is determined to continue its Olympic success without Patty Mills, aiming to compete for a medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. This transition heralds a new chapter for Australian basketball as they gear up to build on the foundation Mills laid and strive for future victories on the world stage. This shift not only challenges the team to evolve but also honors the legacy Mills leaves behind, with aspirations to replicate and surpass past achievements.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julian_ojeda@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Julian Ojeda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patty Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Oceania_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Oceania Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Patty-Mills-goes-out-firing-with-expected-Australia-retirement-decision.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797475", "eventUri": "eng-9797475", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

There was, however, another chapter to his legacy in the international game.\n\nMaybe the last chapter.\n\nAustralia and \"Fiba Patty\" -- that's what people call him when he puts on the national team uniform, because his game often seems to rise to a different level in international play -- were ousted from the Paris Games on Tuesday, falling 95-90 to Serbia in overtime in the quarterfinals.\n\nMills finished with 26 points and if this was the end -- at least on this stage -- he would finish his Olympic career with 567 points. That's fifth-most in Olympic men's basketball history, behind only Oscar Schmidt, Andrew Gaze, Pau Gasol and Luis Scola.\n\n\"This is why you play international basketball,\" Mills said. \"It's a different sport than any other league in the world. It brings the best out of everyone.\"\n\nAnd for a four-minute stretch of the first half, FIBA Patty was surely at his best.\n\nHe had two points in the game's first eight minutes, two more in the final eight minutes of the half. That sliver of time in the middle was dazzling: 16 points in a span of 3:31, to be exact, an array of 3-pointers and drives and high-arching shots that hit nothing but net.\n\nIt all fueled a 20-0 run, one that gave Australia a 24-point lead.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know if there's anything going through my mind at that stage other than just being able to do what you rep and rep and rep and the thousands and millions of shots that you practice just to have a three-minute stretch like that,\" Mills said. \"No one will ever be able to understand. It's a lot of practice. If there's any advice, it's that the practice and the hard work will pay off.\"\n\nMills has worn Australia's colors in no fewer than 15 international Fiba tournaments, including five Olympics -- Beijing in 2008, London in 2012, Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Tokyo three years ago on a run to a bronze medal, and now Paris.\n\nTo put in perspective who Mills becomes when he plays for Australia, it can be explained like this:\n\n-- In 990 NBA games, including playoffs, he's scored 30 or more points five times.\n\n-- In 29 Olympic games, he's done that four times.\n\nLet's take that a step further. His high in the NBA this past season was 17 points, for Miami in a blowout win over Portland. On Tuesday, he had 18 points in his first nine minutes on the court.\n\n\"We threw everything at them,\" Mills said.\n\nHis NBA high is 34 points. He's topped that twice in Olympic play: 39 points against Britain in 2012 to give Australia a spot in the London quarterfinals, then 42 points against Slovenia three years ago for the bronze medal in Tokyo, the long-awaited first podium trip on the major international stage for the Boomers.\n\nHis final basket Tuesday: a falling-down prayer from the foul line over the outstretched arm of Serbian star and NBA MVP Nikola Jokic with about one second left in regulation, forcing overtime.\n\n\"You live for those moments,\" Mills said. \"Down two, as a little kid, in the backyard, underneath the clothesline in Australia. You imagine yourself in those moments, being able to hit a big shot in the Olympic Games to force overtime. We gave ourselves a chance. At the end of the day, it wasn't our day.\"\n\nMills turns 36 on Sunday. Longtime Australian teammate Joe Ingles is 36. Matthew Dellavedova is 33. With no major international tournament until the next World Cup in 2027, it surely seems like this is the end of this run for that core of Boomers. It's likely time for the next generation -- 21-year-old Josh Giddey had a brilliant Olympics -- to take over, and Mills said that with players like that \"the Boomers are in great hands.\"\n\n\"We've just enjoyed every moment of this journey,\" Mills said. \"It hasn't been a smooth-sailing ship, but you do it together and you never take those moments for granted. But through the thick and thin and ups and downs, happy tears, sad tears, it's been an incredible journey to be able to share with those guys.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.inquirer.net", "dataType":

It brings the best out of everyone.\"\n\nAnd for a four-minute stretch of the first half, FIBA Patty was surely at his best.\n\nHe had two points in the game's first eight minutes, two more in the final eight minutes of the half. That sliver of time in the middle was dazzling: 16 points in a span of 3:31, to be exact, an array of 3-pointers and drives and high-arching shots that hit nothing but net.\n\nIt all fuelled a 20-0 run, one that gave Australia a 24-point lead.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know if there's anything going through my mind at that stage other than just being able to do what you rep and rep and rep and the thousands and millions of shots that you practice just to have a three-minute stretch like that,\" Mills said. \"No one will ever be able to understand. It's a lot of practice. If there's any advice, it's that the practice and the hard work will pay off.\"\n\nMills has worn Australia's colours in no fewer than 15 international FIBA tournaments, including five Olympics -- Beijing in 2008, London in 2012, Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Tokyo three years ago on a run to a bronze medal, and now Paris.\n\nTo put in perspective who Mills becomes when he plays for Australia, it can be explained like this: In 990 NBA games, including playoffs, he's scored 30 or more points five times. In 29 Olympic games, he's done that four times.\n\nLet's take that a step further. His high in the NBA this past season was 17 points, for Miami in a blowout win over Portland. On Tuesday, he had 18 points in his first nine minutes on the court.\n\n\"We threw everything at them,\" Mills said.\n\nHis NBA high is 34 points. He's topped that twice in Olympic play: 39 points against Britain in 2012 to give Australia a spot in the London quarterfinals, then 42 points against Slovenia three years ago for the bronze medal in Tokyo, the long-awaited first podium trip on the major international stage for the Boomers.\n\nHis final basket Tuesday: a falling-down prayer from the foul line over the outstretched arm of Serbian star and NBA MVP Nikola Jokic with about one second left in regulation, forcing overtime.\n\n\"You live for those moments,\" Mills said. \"Down two, as a little kid, in the backyard, underneath the clothesline in Australia. You imagine yourself in those moments, being able to hit a big shot in the Olympic Games to force overtime. We gave ourselves a chance. At the end of the day, it wasn't our day.\"\n\nMills turns 36 on Sunday. Longtime Australian teammate Joe Ingles is 36. Matthew Dellavedova is 33. With no major international tournament until the next World Cup in 2027, it surely seems like this is the end of this run for that core of Boomers. It's likely time for the next generation -- 21-year-old Josh Giddey had a brilliant Olympics -- to take over, and Mills said that with players like that \"the Boomers are in great hands.\"\n\n\"We've just enjoyed every moment of this journey,\" Mills said. \"It hasn't been a smooth-sailing ship, but you do it together and you never take those moments for granted. But through the thick and thin and ups and downs, happy tears, sad tears, it's been an incredible journey to be able to share with those guys.\"", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ingles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ingles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Dellavedova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Dellavedova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3066%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_179%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_no_label_no_age_social_wm/115b1303cb55571b512dee5479cc3a228d4c8986", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797475", "eventUri": "eng-9797475", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Mills takes it to another level when outside the league. As impressive as he was against Serbia on Tuesday, they came up short. Serbia mounted a comeback and defeated Australia 95-90 in overtime.\n\nMills, known for his prowess in knocking down shots from the perimeter, was in top form this game. He utilized pick-and-roll situations to his advantage, maintaining a calm and collected demeanor against Serbia's defense. His ability to drive to the basket and secure offensive rebounds for second-chance points further showcased his versatility.\n\nThe loss against Serbia, despite Australia's 24-point lead, may signify the end of an era for Australian Olympic basketball. This defeat could mark the conclusion of his illustrious Olympic career. If this is true, it's a fitting end to 'The Patty Mills Show', with him recording 26 points.\n\nMills averaged 5.8 points and 1.5 assists on an inefficient 33.8 percent shooting during his short stint with the Heat. The 35-year-old guard is still sitting in free agency, leaving the Heat's front office with a decision.\n\nMills bleeds green and yellow. He played for the Australian basketball team in five Olympics: Beijing in 2008, London in 2012, Rio de Janeiro in 2016, Tokyo three years ago, where Team Australia earned the bronze medal, and now Paris.\n\nThroughout his Olympic career, he scored 567 points. He ranks fifth in men's basketball history at the Olympics with that total. The four players to score more than him in the Olympics are Oscar Schmidt, Andrew Gaze, Pau Gasol, and Luis Scola.\n\nMiguel Mike Medina is a contributor to Miami Heat On SI.

His verdict on the key matchup between Serbia and Australia consequently became a particular area of interest amongst fans.\n\nOn The Draymond Green Show, the 34-year-old sided with Serbia as his predicted winner for the game. Following this, Green explained how an aging Australian roster under the leadership of Patty Mills could fall short of the European giants.\n\nIn doing so, however, the 4x All-Star paid tribute to the Australian veteran, stating,\n\n\"I think I'm going with Serbia in this one... This is Patty Mills' fourth or fifth Olympics. And Patty Mills, by the way, is one of the greatest Olympians... I wouldn't even say Olympian, just in FIBA, Patty Mills is incredible...But, I just think they are on the wrong side as far as their older guys are going and I don't think the younger guys are quite there, like talented enough to then carry those older guys\".\n\nGreen's words deservingly respected Mills' impressive 15-year professional career. However, they also indicated that the basketball icon's average of 13.3 points per game in this tournament might not be enough to lead them to victory.\n\nTheir recent defeats against Canada and Greece point to the same thing; Mills' FIBA experience may not be enough to pull the team through.\n\nLike Green said, age might become the Aussie's undoing. Of their 12-man roster, 8 players, including Mills, are 28 or older. Meanwhile, the younger core of Dyson Daniels, Josh Giddey, and Josh Green still has a long way to go before taking over from the veterans.\n\nThis further stacks the odds against Australia as they prepare for the crucial matchup against a more balanced Serbian roster.\n\nThat being said, the team remains capable of pulling off surprises. After all, they showed this during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics by securing a bronze medal. This time, they need to rise to the challenges again by defeating Green's favored winners one by one and shattering the heavily favored Team USA's hopes of winning a fifth consecutive gold medal.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sourav_bose@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Sourav Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patty Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_Daniels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyson Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Green (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Communities", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Communities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/859e516f-untitled-design-23.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797475", "eventUri": "eng-9797475", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Like I said to George, I will watch the images and if I'm the guy that did it, I will apologise. For me, I didn't do anything, I just hope that I can go in the final.'\n\nMills appeared to be nudged into the path of Spain's Thierry Ndikumwenayo, with both going down after tangling legs.\n\nRefugee Olympic Team athlete Dominic Lobalu and Dutchman Mike Foppen also went to the ground as they didn't have time to respond to the collision ahead of them. Foppen appeared to land on the back of his head when he hit the ground and was seen holding onto it after he crossed the line.\n\nFortunately for all four athletes that hit the deck in the collision, they were given a post-race reprieve as officials handed them a spot in the final.\n\nHay will also be in the race as he finished seventh, with no disqualification handed to the 27-year-old.\n\nWhen asked to explain by the BBC what happened, Mills said: 'I think it's pretty clear. I got stepped out on as I was about to kick on the home straight and boom, the French lad took me down.'\n\nWhen asked what he told Hay after the race, he responded: 'I probably wouldn't be allowed to say.'\n\nHe went on to add: 'From my perspective that was the perfect qualifier for me. Going through the first 2,000 in six minutes. I was like 'alright - nobody in this field can run away from me at this pace'.\n\nHay tried to diffuse the situation but Mills gave the Frenchman a small push on the chest\n\nMills did not appear to be happy with the Frenchman's response and brushed Hay's hand off his shoulder before walking away\n\n'So I was just sitting, waiting and biding my time, gonna kick off down the home straight and bang hit the deck. What can you do?'\n\nPaula Radcliffe, who was covering the race for the BBC, said after the race: 'There's a lot to look back at, I lot to tidy up and decide whose fault it was.\n\n'If you decide to jog that slightly, it's kind of your own fault.

That was enough to send them home but they will land in Germany on Monday as favourites to win the Euros.\n\nOptimism was tempered on Friday night during a poor 1-0 defeat by Iceland at Wembley - after which there were boos among home fans - but Kane believes that could yet prove a good thing, especially as their opponent's game-plan will likely reflect that of group rivals Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia.\n\n'This could be a nice wake-up call for everyone to realise it is not going to be as easy as people think,' said the England captain.\n\n'There is a lot of work to do. Sometimes, you need this wake-up call. There are areas we need to improve, especially with our pressure. The group games are going to be very similar to this. We are going to have to defend well, especially the longer balls, and with the ball we need to be a bit more patient. It is one to look back on.'\n\nHarry Kane has insisted England won't have everything their own way at Euro 2024\n\nKane is eager to avoid a repeat of the 2022 World Cup, when he missed a penalty v France\n\nThe Bayern Munich star did not pull any punches, as he went on: 'We fell below our standards without the ball and that is something we have to review and get better with.\n\n'We had spells where we did well and played some really nice football and created some good chances. But against these types of teams especially, you have to be more clinical.\n\n'There probably wasn't enough hunger in the duels, in the second balls and winning those. They are a big important part when you are playing these teams, to sustain the pressure and really suffocate them. We didn't do that well.'\n\nKane insists that belief in the group remains stronger than ever and says his own personal torment in Qatar is now firmly behind him.\n\n'Pretty s***, wasn't it?' he said of the penalty miss and loss to France. 'In football you are going to have ups and downs on the way. Of course, that was a down for me at the moment, but I think over two years, for club and for country, I have put that to bed and I am just excited for another major tournament.'\n\nGareth Southgate's side lost 1-0 to Iceland but Kane believes that it can be a wake-up call\n\nKane says there is a real hunger in the England squad after reaching the final of Euro 2020\n\nHe added: 'I have said many times to judge us on the tournament form, on the tournament football. Of course, there will be some noise about Friday, but I think there is a lot of optimism from the fans and rightly so. Ultimately it is down to us to make sure we get it right on the pitch. We have a lot of fantastic players. Players who have had really, really good seasons. You can't ignore that.\n\n'Being so close in the last Euros (beaten in final), there is a real hunger to be back. It comes around quick, if I'm honest. We had the World Cup and we are back here again. I feel like we are on the right path.\n\n'But as we all know, it is really difficult to win these tournaments.

When asked whether he thought about how the last tournament ended, he said: \"Yeah, pretty s*** wasn't it?\n\n\"I think in football you are going to have ups and downs on the way. Of course that was a down for me at the moment but I think over two years, for club and for country, I have put that to bed and I am just excited for another major tournament.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

That was enough to send them home but they will land in Germany on Monday as favourites to win the Euros.\n\nOptimism was tempered on Friday night during a poor 1-0 defeat by Iceland at Wembley - after which there were boos among home fans - but Kane believes that could yet prove a good thing, especially as their opponent's game-plan will likely reflect that of group rivals Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia.\n\n'This could be a nice wake-up call for everyone to realise it is not going to be as easy as people think,' said the England captain.\n\n'There is a lot of work to do.

But against these types of teams especially, you have to be more clinical.\n\n'There probably wasn't enough hunger in the duels, in the second balls and winning those.

England are one of the favourites to win the Euros along with the likes of France, Germany and Portugal but Gareth Southgate 's men were given a brutal reality check by Iceland.\n\nThe final friendly at Wembley was supposed to be a morale-boosting send-off but it turned into a nightmare and raised major doubts about England's defending and whether Southgate could find the right balance in midfield.\n\nThey have less than a week to prepare for the Group opener with Serbia next Sunday and alarm bells have started to ring. Luke Shaw has just returned to training while Jude Bellingham reported up this weekend after his Champions League heroics.\n\nSouthgate took a big decision on axing Jack Grealish and Harry Maguire from England's Euros squad to give a new generation their chance but it does raise question marks whether they have enough experience. Kane insists that they still have enough strength in depth plus the likes of Cole Palmer and Anthony Gordon have earned their places.\n\nBayern Munich striker Kane said: \"Everyone here has earned the right to be here and has proven they deserve to be there.

You can only choose 26. We have done that and I think we have a fantastic squad.\n\n\"But as always, it is about how you handle the games and the tournament, how you handle the pressure.

England have a younger squad, less caps and less tournament experience. When you ditch big players like Maguire and Grealish, it puts more focus on the likes of Marc Guehi and Phil Foden, Gordon and Palmer to step up.\n\nBut Kane says they can all handle it. He said: \"I think we have more than enough experience. Especially a lot of players who have played in two or three tournaments now.\n\n\"There are always going to be new players, players who deserve to be here, players who are in their first tournament.

The plan was for me to play 60 minutes today. It has been a really good camp for me personally in that sense. Getting a good week of training, 30 minutes, few more days of training, then 60 minutes.

favourites for Euro 2024 but they were booed off following a 1-0 defeat in their final warm-up game for the tournament.\n\nThe Three Lions head to Germany with one of their most talented squads in recent memory and stand a really good chance of ending their long 58-year wait for a trophy.\n\nEngland will be looking to go one better having lost the final of Euro 2020 on penalties to Italy, but it feels like they are heading to Germany slightly underprepared.\n\nSouthgate's side will come up against Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia in the group stage, and Kane who scored 36 Bundesliga goals in his debut season for Bayern Munich feels there is plenty to improve upon ahead of their opening game on Sunday.\n\n\"Of course there will be some noise about it [losing to Iceland] but I think there is a lot of optimism from the fans and rightly so,\" Kane said in quotes picked up by BBC Sport.\n\n\"This could be a nice wake-up call for everyone to realise it is not going to be as easy as people think, there is a lot of work to do.\"\n\n\"There are areas we need to improve, especially with our pressure.\n\n\"The group games are going to be very similar to this, we are going to have to defend well, especially the longer balls, and with the ball we need to be a bit more patient, it is one to look back on.\"\n\nKane also insisted the belief amongst the group remains as strong as it's ever been and that he's excited for another major tournament.\n\n\"I am just excited for another major tournament,\" he added.\n\n\"I have said many times to judge us on the tournament form, on the tournament football.\n\n\"Ultimately it is down to us to make sure we get it right on the pitch, we have a lot of fantastic players, players who have had really, really good seasons, you can't ignore that.\n\n'Being so close in the last Euros (beaten in final), there is a real hunger to be back, it comes around quick, if I'm honest.\n\n\"We had the World Cup and we are back here again, I feel like

But since then he has become \u00adEngland's record goalscorer with 63 goals from 91 caps and has enjoyed a prolific debut season at \u00adBayern Munich after his transfer from Tottenham last summer.\n\nKane admitted he does still think about how England's previous tournament ended - \"Yeah, pretty shit, wasn't it?\" - but it is not something that plays on his mind.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he said. \"In \u00adfootball you are going to have ups and downs on the way. Of course that was a down for me but I think over two years, for club and for country, I have put that to bed and I am just excited for another major tournament.\"\n\nEngland lost on penalties against Italy in the Euro 2020 final and they travel to Germany on Monday as the bookmakers' favourites to win a first major men's trophy since 1966. \"Being so close in the last Euros, there is a real hunger to be back,\" Kane said. \"It comes around quick.

Every winner does. We have that mindset that we can achieve it. We also know there is a lot of hard work from now until the final in July.\"\n\nGareth Southgate has had a number of fitness issues in the squad, with Kane among those to give him a scare. According to Thomas Tuchel, who was the Bayern manager at the time, Kane had a \"complete blockade in his back\" and was a selection doubt for the club's Champions League semi\u2011final \u00adsecond leg against Real Madrid. Kane was substituted in the 85th \u00adminute and missed Bayern's final two \u00adBundesliga games.\n\nKane returned as a 61st-minute substitute in England's 3-0 friendly win against Bosnia and Herzegovina last Monday and played 64 minutes as a starter in the 1-0 defeat by Iceland on Friday. Southgate has included two backup strikers in his squad - Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney.\n\n\"I am all good,\" Kane said. \"The plan was for me to play 60 minutes against Iceland. It has been a really good camp for me personally in that sense. Getting a good week of \u00adtraining, 30 minutes [against Bosnia and Herzegovina], a few more days of training, then 60 minutes. I feel really prepared and in a good place.\"\n\nSouthgate had to make tough decisions at the very last over his 26-man squad, the most \u00addifficult call being those to cut Harry Maguire and Jack \u00adGrealish. The former was based on the medical advice that Maguire, who is recovering from a calf injury, would not be fit until the last 16 at the earliest. The squad has 13 \u00adplayers with no experience of major tournaments. Twelve have been to at least two, with seven players - including Kane - \u00adhaving gone to three or four.\n\n\"I think we have more than enough experience,\" Kane said. \"Especially a lot of players who have played in two or three tournaments. There are always going to be new players, players who deserve to be here. We have more than enough. For the boys who missed out, it is really tough to take - for H [Maguire] especially, being injured. I know how much England means to him. It is sad to see them go but ultimately that is what you get playing for England. The manager has to take tough decisions.\n\n\"Everyone has earned the right to be here. That is what we have said. Everyone brings something \u00addifferent to the team and we are going to need all 26 players if we are going to be \u00adsuccessful. That is the message - that we are together.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_hytner@theguardian.com", "name": "David

Harry Kane is hoping to make history in more ways that one when he captains Euro 2024 favourites England at this summer's tournament in Germany.\n\nThe 30-year-old entered the 17th edition of the European Championship following an exceptional debut campaign in front of goal for Bayern Munich, scoring 44 goals in 45 games across all competitions.\n\nKane, widely regarded as one of the best strikers in world football, has also been prolific for England and is the nation's all-time leading scorer with 61 goals in 91 appearances over a nine-year period.\n\nThe striker scored eight times in Euro 2024 qualifying, which was only bettered by three players, and he is one of the favourites to claim the Golden Boot, six years on from receiving the same prize at the 2018 World Cup.\n\nKane is one of the standout names selected in Gareth Southgate's 26-man England squad and he is set to become the first ever player to captain the Three Lions at four major tournaments when he leads his side out at Euro 2024.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nKane wants to \"make history\" with England\n\nKane, who is yet to win a trophy in his club or international career, has come up short on a few occasions in recent major tournaments, with England losing in the final of Euro 2020 before being knocked out at the semi-final stage of the 2022 World Cup.\n\nNevertheless, Kane is keen to \"make history\" and lead England to their first ever European Championship title, as well as end almost 60 years of hurt suffered by the Three Lions since they triumphed at the 1966 World Cup.\n\n\"I'm excited. There's always excitement, especially when you get out to the host nation, settle into the hotel and see where everything is,\" Kane told UEFA.com. \"Hopefully it's going to be our camp for a good four or five weeks.\n\n\"As the days go on you start to get a bit of nerves, the preparation starts, and you watch the first game, Germany versus Scotland, and that's when it really kicks in. But at the moment, everyone's pretty calm and excited.\n\nKane added: \"I think this (England) squad is one of the best, if not the best, we've had, going on form and the domestic seasons a lot of us have had.\n\n\"We have incredible young talent coming through who are fearless and just want to get on the ball and play. I hope that the guys can lean on me and ask me questions, and if I can help them get through anything, then great. But we have such a good togetherness, we're always talking or having dinner together and there's always conversations being had, so that helps us.\"\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nKane 'honoured' to captain England at Euro 2024\n\nAsked about breaking England's major tournament captaincy record, Kane said: \"Being England captain and leading the boys out is probably the highest privilege I can have as a player, and I'll never take that for granted. That feeling is truly one of a kind.\n\n\"It's an honour to do it for a fourth time. We've had a semi-final, a final and a quarter-final, so I'm hoping we go to the very end and go on and win.\n\n\"We've had some really good moments, and I've personally had some really good moments, but ultimately we're here to win a Euros, and that's hopefully what we can do.\"\n\nKane is expected to start in England's opening Group C fixture against Serbia at Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday, before the Three Lions face Denmark and Slovenia in their final two group-stage matches.\n\nID:545842:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect4782:No Data Analysis info", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thomas@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Oliver Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/24/harry-kane_1.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9637980", "eventUri": "eng-9637980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Yet Kane maintains that the problems should not discourage England from viewing themselves as one of the favourites for the tournament.\n\n\"Being so close in the last Euros, there is a real hunger to be back,\" the striker said. \"It comes around quick, if I'm honest. We had the World Cup and we are back here again.\n\n* James Gheerbrant: My year with Harry Kane\n\n\"I feel like we are on the right path. But as we all know as well, it is really difficult to win these tournaments. There are a lot of things that you have to do right and prepare right, and you need a bit of luck here and there. Every winner does. We have that mindset that we can achieve it. We also know there is a lot of hard work from now until the final in July.\"\n\nThe manner of the disjointed performance against Iceland came after a difficult 48 hours in which the omissions of Jack Grealish and Harry Maguire from the final 26-man party left Southgate admitting new bonds needed to be forged within the group.\n\nProvided that John Stones suffers no reaction to the ankle knock that resulted in him being substituted at half-time, he will take his place in England's rearguard for the opening game alongside Kyle Walker, Kieran Trippier and probably Marc Gu\u00e9hi.\n\nSouthgate will work on how they operate as a unit and cover each other in the hope the drills will make England more cohesive and provide the platform for them to fulfil their potential.\n\nKane said: \"Sometimes you need this wake-up call. There are areas we need to improve, especially with our pressure. The group games are going to be very similar to this. We are going to have to defend well, especially the longer balls, and with the ball we need to be a bit more patient.\n\n\"We fell below our standards without the ball and that is something we have to review and get better with. It goes back to [the issue of being] without the ball that we need to improve. There probably was not enough hunger in the duels, in the second balls and winning those. They are a big, important part when you are playing these teams, to sustain the pressure and really suffocate them.\n\n\"We are going in there as one of the favourites and that is a responsibility that we have to take forward now, because we have earned the right to be there. We will never take it for granted. I have said many times to judge us on the tournament form, on the tournament football. Of course there will be some noise about [Iceland], but I think there is a lot of optimism from the fans and rightly so.\n\n\"Ultimately, it is down to us to make sure we get it right on the pitch. This could be a nice wake-up call for everyone to realise it is not going to be as easy as people think.\"\n\nKane ended the season nursing a back injury with Bayern Munich, but runouts against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland have left him feeling \"good\" and ready to take strain once again. His last experience of a major tournament came with the World Cup quarter-final 2-1 defeat to France, in which he missed a penalty.\n\nThe memory was, he said, \"pretty shit\", but does not weigh heavily on his psyche. \"I don't think so. I think in football you are going to have ups and downs on the way,\" he added.\n\n\"Of course that was a down for me at the moment, but I think over two years, for club and for country, I have put that to bed and I am just excited for another major tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "thetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thetimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_joyce@thetimes.com", "name": "Paul Joyce", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F09443926-cc33-456b-af1b-1ddf90afe06c.jpg?crop=3448%2C1940%2C17%2C211&resize=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9637980", "eventUri": "eng-9637980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 253, "textEnd": 260}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Sometimes, you need this wake-up call. There are areas we need to improve, especially with our pressure. The group games are going to be very similar to this. We are going to have to defend well, especially the longer balls, and with the ball we need to be a bit more patient. It is one to look back on.\"\n\nThe Bayern Munich marksman added: \"We fell below our standards without the ball and that is something we have to review and get better with.\n\n\"We had spells where we did well and played some really nice football and created some good chances. But against these types of teams especially, you have to be more clinical.\n\n\"There probably wasn't enough hunger in the duels, in the second balls and winning those. They are a big important part when you are playing these teams, to sustain the pressure and really suffocate them. We didn't do that well.\"\n\nKane insisted he had put his England disappointment behind him, having missed a crucial penalty during the Three Lions' quarter final defeat to France in the Qatar World Cup.\n\n\"Pretty s***, wasn't it?\" he said of the penalty miss and loss to Le Bleus.\n\n\"In football you are going to have ups and downs on the way. Of course, that was a down for me at the moment, but I think over two years, for club and for country, I have put that to bed and I am just excited for another major tournament.\n\n\"I have said many times to judge us on the tournament form, on the tournament football. Of course, there will be some noise about Friday, but I think there is a lot of optimism from the fans and rightly so. Ultimately it is down to us to make sure we get it right on the pitch. We have a lot of fantastic players. Players who have had really, really good seasons. You can't ignore that.\n\n\"Being so close in the last Euros (beaten in final), there is a real hunger to be back. It comes around quick if I'm honest. We had the World Cup and we are back here again. I feel like we are on the right path.\n\n\"But as we all know, it is really difficult to win these tournaments. There are a lot of things that you have to do right and prepare right, and you need a bit of luck here and there. Every winner does. We have that mindset that we can achieve it. We also know there is a lot of hard work from now until the final in July.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/bltbe08110d8a4e531b/6666ab14c176937aa7f9fc63/448093796_7717138571696255_3645823612211368826_n.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9637980", "eventUri": "eng-9637980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Three Lions captain Kane said: \"They're a team that can hurt you if you're not set up correctly and defensively they're really strong.\n\n\"They make it difficult for us with their moves and they have tall players so they can be very dangerous. If we're not careful it could be a difficult game for us so we need to make sure we get that right.\n\n\"I think we have earned this favourites status through our tournaments so far.

I hope the guys can rely on me and ask me questions and if I can help them overcome something then that's great.\n\n\"But we have such a good bond, we're always talking to each other or having dinner together and there's always conversation and that helps us.\n\n\"Gareth had a really difficult decision to make because we have some very good attacking players. But for me personally it's fantastic.\n\n\"I want to play with players who can provide assists, who can score goals, who move well and who can get the ball in tight spaces, and we have all of that.\n\n\"Captaining England and leading the boys is probably the biggest privilege I can have as a player and I will never take that for granted. This feeling is truly unique. It's an honour to do this for the fourth time.\n\n\"We've had a semi-final, a final and a quarter-final so I hope we can go all the way and win. We've had some really good moments, including myself, but ultimately we're here to win a EURO and hopefully we can do that.\n\n\"I'm excited. You're always excited, especially when you arrive in the host country, settle into the hotel and see where everything is.\n\n\"Hopefully this will be our camp for four or five weeks. As the days go by you get a bit nervous, the preparation starts and when you see the first game, Germany against Scotland, that's when it really starts.

But Kane revealed that Bayern team mate Thomas Muller left him a good luck note in his room for when he arrived.\n\nKane added: \"Tommy left me a little message because they [the Germans] were here just a couple of weeks ago. He wrote to me saying the golf course was great but the weather wasn't so good.\n\n\"But the course looks fantastic, the hotel is incredible and being in Germany is a bit like a second home.\n\n\"The welcome I received when I arrived at Bayern was incredible and since I've been at the hotel, some of the staff have come up to me and greeted me.

Jude Bellingham's late arrival and an apparent over-reliance on him. Luke Shaw's hamstring. The loss of Harry Maguire. And, for 24 hours when Gareth Southgate got brave and some of our nation got scared, the axing of Jack Grealish and James Maddison.\n\nBut the elephant in the dressing-room is Harry Kane, or at least it should be. We have forgotten that he finished the season at Bayern Munich with a back injury, and he did not look himself during an hour of Friday night's 1-0 defeat by Iceland. But we have forgotten, too, that for all the talk of Bellingham being the saviour, Kane is the one England player who is irreplaceable.\n\nPhil Foden was poor against Iceland but, as Premier League Player of the Year, he is a fine alternative to Bellingham at No.10. Declan Rice, meanwhile, is better than Bellingham in a deeper role.\n\nThere is no substitute for Kane, not when the deputies for this country's greatest-ever goalscorer have three international goals between them, and that from just 15 caps. Ollie Watkins has never convinced in an England jersey. Some strikers don't. Exceptional strikers, too. See Andy Cole, Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright and Robbie Fowler. When Watkins toiled for 60 minutes in North Macedonia in November, he was replaced by Kane. Within 60 seconds the captain had forced an equaliser.\n\nIvan Toney is less exposed at this level and could well thrive, but he is not in the squad to start games. More so, it is events some two hours after kick-off that could prove his worth, and the possibility of penalty shootouts.\n\nEngland need Harry Kane to be at his sharpest if they are to make a major impact at Euro 2024\n\nBellingham will be a hugely important figure for England but Kane remains the main man\n\nGareth Southgate doesn't have any other striking options with the same quality as Kane\n\nPodcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola?

EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify\n\nKane, then, is the starter and finisher upon whom England's hopes genuinely rest. When an Iceland player landed on John Stones' ankle in the opening minutes, there was much talk of England being one injury away from having no chance of winning the Euros.\n\nThat assertion was correct, but it was incorrect in identifying Stones as the player they cannot lose. The defence is weak with and without Stones, but the strength of Kane at the other end could yet mask that. Lose Kane and England lose the one thing that tears them apart from nearly all of their rivals - a world-class goalscorer.\n\nWhile Southgate was quizzed post-match on Friday about the importance of Bellingham and how his addition will raise standards, the team's true standard-bearer was holding court in an adjacent corridor. Kane is England's adult, on and off the pitch. And much like a parent, he was telling the kids to wake up. 'This could be a nice wake-up call for everyone to realise it is not going to be as easy as people think,' he said.\n\nKane, who ended the season with a back injury, missed an inviting chance against Iceland\n\nThe 30-year-old last played for Bayern Munich against Real Madrid more than a month ago\n\nIt was not nice. Much of Friday's send-off was horrible. But his point stands - England are not the tournament favourites some would have you believe. Not when they are so dependent on the form and fitness of one man. And no, that's not Bellingham.\n\nSo, how is Kane's back? This was the sixth of 10 questions asked. It should have been the first.\n\n'I am all good,' he said. 'The plan was for me to play 60 minutes. It has been a really good camp for me personally, in that sense. Getting a good week of training, 30 minutes (against Bosnia), few more days of training, then 60 minutes. I feel really prepared and in a good place. It would have been nice if I had scored that chance (against Iceland), but that's the way it goes.'\n\nKane had volleyed over from a few yards out when unmarked. Insignificant, perhaps, in the wider story of his wonderful England career. But significant if that miss is a forewarning of the story yet untold.\n\nThe 30-year-old last played for Bayern over a month ago, when substituted in the second half of the second leg of their Champions League semi-final defeat by Real Madrid. He was only brought off because Thomas Tuchel had doubts over his ability to impact, because of his bad back.\n\nIvan Toney and Ollie Watkins are in the squad but Kane is England's only world class goalscorer\n\nWithout his trusted generals Jordan Henderson and Harry Maguire, Southgate needs Kane\n\nKane's back has not since had the round-the-clock attention of Wayne Rooney's or David Beckham's metatarsals, but maybe we have taken too much comfort from knowing the injury was never enough to keep him out of the finals. A half-fit Kane, however, would more than halve England's chances of victory. Southgate must also harbour concern, for he has included two other centre-forwards in his final squad for the first time.\n\nThe manager would not have minded Kane borrowing his own statesman-like mantle and addressing the team's shortcomings at the weekend. When the skipper questioned the 'hunger' of the side, it felt like territory into which only he could venture. But without his other trusted generals, Jordan Henderson and Maguire, Southgate needs that.\n\nIndeed, he needs Kane more than any other player, and he needs Kane to be fit and firing. Without that, there is a chance that England will not be fit for purpose.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Three Lions captain Kane said: \"They're a team that can hurt you if you're not set up correctly and defensively they're really strong.\n\n\"They make it difficult for us with their moves and they have tall players so they can be very dangerous. If we're not careful it could be a difficult game for us so we need to make sure we get that right.\n\n\"I think we have earned this favourites status through our tournaments so far. But we are also a team that has never won a EURO, so we are trying to make history here.\n\n\"It is a goal we want to achieve, but we know it will be a long, hard road. We have to make sure we do everything right because if you are not 100 percent in these tournaments, you can be punished.\"\n\nKane is now England's record goal scorer and they also have the likes of Jude Bellingham, Declan Rice and Phil Foden to give them a world class squad.\n\nBayern Munich star Kane believes it could be the best team he has been a part of and claims that even though they may lack experience some of the young players are \"fearless.\"\n\nKane said: \"This squad is one of the best, if not the best, we've ever had when you look at the form and the respective leagues that many of us have played in.\n\n\"We've got incredible young talent who are fearless and just want to play. I hope the guys can rely on me and ask me questions and if I can help them overcome something then that's great.\n\n\"But we have such a good bond, we're always talking to each other or having dinner together and there's always conversation and that helps us.\n\n\"Gareth had a really difficult decision to make because we have some very good attacking players. But for me personally it's fantastic.\n\n\"I want to play with players who can provide assists, who can score goals, who move well and who can get the ball in tight spaces, and we have all of that.\n\n\"Captaining England and leading the boys is probably the biggest privilege I can have as a player and I will never take that for granted. This feeling is truly unique. It's an honour to do this for the fourth time.\n\n\"We've had a semi-final, a final and a quarter-final so I hope we can go all the way and win. We've had some really good moments, including myself, but ultimately we're here to win a EURO and hopefully we can do that.\n\n\"I'm excited. You're always excited, especially when you arrive in the host country, settle into the hotel and see where everything is.\n\n\"Hopefully this will be our camp for four or five weeks. As the days go by you get a bit nervous, the preparation starts and when you see the first game, Germany against Scotland, that's when it really starts. But at the moment everyone is pretty calm and excited.\"\n\nEngland are based near Erfurt in the luxury Spa & GolfResort Weimarer Land which Germany used for their Euros build-up and preparation before moving to their Adidas Football Centre base in Munich. But Kane revealed that Bayern team mate Thomas Muller left him a good luck note in his room for when he arrived.\n\nKane added: \"Tommy left me a little message because they [the Germans] were here just a couple of weeks ago. He wrote to me saying the golf course was great but the weather wasn't so good.\n\n\"But the course looks fantastic, the hotel is incredible and being in Germany is a bit like a second home.\n\n\"The welcome I received when I arrived at Bayern was incredible and since I've been at the hotel, some of the staff have come up to me and greeted me.

The defeat, marked by a missed close-range opportunity from Kane, has cast a shadow over England's preparations as they head into the tournament.\n\nWhat Harry Kane said\n\nReflecting on the loss, Kane did not mince words. \"This could be a nice wake-up call for everyone to realise it is not going to be as easy as people think,\" he told reporters. Kane's message is clear: the team must learn from this defeat and improve quickly if they hope to succeed in Germany. He emphasized that the match highlighted areas where England needs to get better, particularly in their defensive efforts and patience with the ball.\n\nKane's warning comes with a backdrop of personal and team disappointment. The striker was a central figure in England's exit from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, missing a crucial penalty against France in the quarter-finals. He candidly described that experience as \"pretty sh*t\" and urged his teammates to use past failures as motivation to go all the way in Euro 2024.\n\nKane didn't hold back in his assessment of the Iceland match. \"There is a lot of work to do,\" he said. \"Sometimes, you need this wake-up call. There are areas we need to improve, especially with our pressure. The group games are going to be very similar to this. We are going to have to defend well, especially the longer balls, and with the ball, we need to be a bit more patient.\"\n\nWhere to improve for England for EUro 2024\n\nHe pointed out specific shortcomings, such as a lack of hunger in duels and winning second balls. \"They are a big important part when you are playing these teams, to sustain the pressure and really suffocate them. We didn't do that well,\" Kane admitted.\n\nKane's comments highlight the broader challenges facing England. The team has a reputation to uphold and a title to chase, with many fans expecting a strong performance. The loss to Iceland serves as a stark reminder that nothing can be taken for granted. Kane's leadership and experience are crucial, especially as he aims for another Golden Boot, having previously won the award at the 2018 World Cup.\n\nReflecting on past Euro's\n\nDiscussing the quarter-final defeat to France, Kane said, \"Pretty sh*t, wasn't it? In football, you are going to have ups and downs on the way. Of course, that was a down for me at the moment, but I think over two years, for club and for country, I have put that to bed and I am just excited for another major tournament.\"\n\nEngland faces a challenging group at Euro 2024, with matches against Serbia, Slovenia, and Denmark. Kane, who has scored 12 goals in 22 major tournament games since Euro 2016, will be a key player for the Three Lions. His focus and determination will be vital as England seeks to navigate the group stage and advance further in the tournament.\n\nHarry Kane's stern warning is a call to arms for the England squad.

The lads who have played in a lot of tournaments have to step up and be there for the ones who need a bit of help.\"\n\nThe question, though, is less whether England have enough leaders -- Jordan Pickford, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Declan Rice and Kane all have more than a half-century of caps, and Kieran Trippier is on 48 -- and more whether they can gel quickly enough as a coherent unit with so many new faces.\n\nIn Friday's defeat by Iceland at Wembley, England played more like a collection of talented individuals than a functioning team, suggesting Southgate's new-look side is going to the Euros as a work in progress.\n\nIt did not necessarily have to be that way for the manager, who has spent the best part of eight years building a squad to win a major finals, gradually tweaking his tactics and fine-tuning selections, only to rip out some key elements on the eve of what could be his last tournament in charge.\n\nThere is obviously a paradox in accusing Southgate of being too bold now, because the manager's critics have long called for him to pick on form, rather than reputation.\n\nAs Southgate knows all too well, though, he can never win, so there will inevitably be suggestions that he has gone too far if his side continue to look disjointed at the finals.\n\nIt was easy to wonder on Friday night if, say, Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips might have been worth including in the squad after all, notwithstanding miserable club form.\n\nRashford and Sterling, for example, have scored a combined 37 goals for England and have usually thrived running beyond Kane.\n\nJarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer, by contrast, all fully deserve to be in the squad on form, but have one international goal between them (Palmer's penalty against Bosnia and Herzegovina last week) and are still to gel in a front four with Kane, Phil Foden and the rest.\n\nIt was perhaps no surprise that Palmer was England's brightest player against Iceland, because he is such a brilliant individual, used to dragging a dysfunctional team through stodgy matches after his breakthrough season with Chelsea.\n\nKane has called for England to be judged on tournament form, while Southgate will feel the Iceland game was not a fair representation of his side, particularly as Jude Bellingham was missing and his players were, presumably, focused as much on avoiding injury as impressing.\n\nEngland, though, feel less like a group at the peak of a cycle and more like a side starting a new one, leaving Southgate facing the challenge of fine-tuning his side in time for the knockouts in a few weeks' time.\n\n\"Everyone here has earned the right to be here and has proven they deserve to be here,\" said Kane, who defended the manager's brave selections.\n\nHarry Kane on England's final Euro 2024 squad selection\n\n\"[We have] a lot of fantastic players, players who have had really good seasons. You can't ignore that. Players at the top of their game deserve to be playing for their country.\n\n\"Being England manager is not easy, you have a lot of tough decisions, a lot of players to pick from. You can only choose 26. We have done that and I think we have a fantastic squad.\n\n\"But as always, it is about how you handle the games and the tournament, how you handle the pressure.

Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est the same bleeding thing all over again.\n\nWhenever Harry Kane approaches a significant mark in his career it is always tempting to peer down the time tunnel in search of a poignant on-this-day-style comparison. Jump back 10 years and Kane, more so than any other elite footballer, is likely to have been on the bench at AFC Egham or scoring a hat-trick against Bogford Cheesedown in the Copydex Industrial Sealants 37th-tier playoff quarter-finals.\n\nRelated: Euro 2024 team guides part 10: England\n\nAs England's captain prepares to lead the team into this summer's European Championship that glance back in time feels notably apt, with a sense that the past has finally begun to catch up with the present. Kane's only action of the summer of 2014 was being summoned from the bench by the England Under-21 manager Gareth Southgate in the dying moments of a 3-1 Euro qualifying win against Wales, the fifth attacker used on the night behind Saido Berahino, Nathan Redmond, Tom Ince and Danny Ings.\n\nTwelve months later Kane played every minute of those junior Euros as England exited limply at the group stage, leaving the unfancied Gareth under fire from the press and the class of 2015 dismissed as another beaten generation.\n\nGary Lineker lamented Southgate's \"exasperatingly amateurish\" selections. There were calls for another root-and-branch re-review of the so-called England DNA pathway instituted by (who he?) Dan Ashworth. \"Young players don't work hard enough,\" raged Harry Redknapp, who had, presumably, actually met the dementedly committed teenaged Kane.\n\nTwo lone voices offered some positivity. Kane, who was according to the Guardian report \"a cut above his teammates\" during the key defeat by Italy, talked gamely about his dream of one day lifting a trophy with England. A little lost in the general outrage, Southgate talked at length about \"some good characters that are going to come through this group and into the senior team\".\n\nThe point being Southgate was right, and remains right now as England settle into their pastoral training idyll before their opening game against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday. Three years after the collapse of 2015, five members of that derided under-21 team were part of Southgate's England World Cup semi-final in Russia.\n\nJust as unexpectedly Kane, one of those \"good characters\", has become arguably England's greatest player, at least according to Wayne Rooney, who knows a bit, and certainly outside of the only ones to win a cup 60 years ago.\n\nThis European Championship finals tournament is a huge moment for Kane, for the Kane Supremacy, and for his own sense of almost-greatness. He will be 31 next month, and 33 shortly after the next World Cup finishes. No doubt Kane wants to go on for ever and retire aged 65 to kick goals in the NFL. But history suggests the life of an England goalscorer is gruelling, and it is always a little later than you think. Rooney was 33 when he played his last game, Alan Shearer 29, Michael Owen 28, Lineker 31, Kevin Keegan 31, Bobby Charlton 32, Geoff Hurst 30.\n\nWith this in mind it is worth stating once again, just how extraordinarily good Kane has been; and how vital he remains for England's hopes now, despite the presence now of starrier, more fashionable attackers.\n\nIt is worth looking at those England numbers again, just because they're so unarguably good, beyond the reach of even the most committed hater. Sixty-three goals in 91 games. Fifty-eight in 74 under Southgate; 12 goals in tournaments. Six in tournament knockout games. One World Cup golden boot. Best goals-per-games ratio of any England player with more than 30.\n\nHe remains at his peak, too. The season just past at Bayern Munich may carry its own note of trophy-less gallows humour, but on a personal note Kane has just conjured up the best debut overseas season for any English player, and done so while playing for the third-best team. Thirty-six goals and eight assists in 32 Bundesliga games. Eight and four in the Champions League. European golden boot to go with three in the Premier League. This is a footballing machine.\n\nSo much so that you wonder at times if Kane was a little cooler, if he was called Blaze van der Sexdrive instead of Harry Kane, if he looked less like a Victorian actuary's clerk with a heart of gold, if he was more clippable, more gratuitously flash, he might just get a little more credit. But then, misunderstanding Harry Kane has been a theme of his career, oddly for such a straightforward footballer.\n\nMost obviously there is the irony of Kane, the ultimate team player, winning only individual awards but never team trophies. Then again, his entire career, bar one season, has been spent with teams that have an explicit aversion to winning. Would raking in three successive league titles as an ensemble piece at Manchester City make him a better footballer? Only for the furiously literal-minded.\n\nClearly Kane Stayed at Spurs a bit too long, but then it is easy to forget that his career has always seemed to strike him as a treat, a glorious bonus. Kane was never a prodigy. He skulked around the Football League on various loans. He loved finding his own ceiling at Spurs, but botched his own exit three years ago, trapped by his own contract.\n\nEven moving to Bayern just as they stopped winning the league looks like a function of that mistake. Other elite clubs decided he was too expensive at 30. Bayern thought it looked like value. Their manager is currently Vincent Kompany. Is this a well-run club? Or a club that Kane is again expected to carry to glory on his creaking, twanging back?\n\nThe sense of some basic misunderstanding of exactly what Kane has achieved is also there with England, who have been routinely accused of having an impossible hand of talent, envy of the world, such that not winning every trophy is seen as failure.\n\nThe truth is Kane's most regular career attacking partner in the Southgate years has been Raheem Sterling (62 times) followed by Marcus Rashford (44), his most common midfield supply man Jordan Henderson. Do these really sound like A-list generational players? Or like very good footballers driven on by England's only really world-class tournament attacker in that time, the man in the 10 shirt?\n\nRelated: Euro 2024: complete guide to all 622 players\n\nAnd this is the real point around Kane at Germany 2024. He is still the only member of this team's attack who has to date \"done it\" regularly for England. Around him are some startlingly talented players. But the fact remains Phil Foden has four goals in 34 caps. Bukayo Saka has had some wonderful games, but has missed a lot too and isn't fully fit. Jude Bellingham already has the world in his palm. But he's still only 20. His moments with England are all to come.\n\nWhereas Kane is as ever the form horse. There is a tactical element here. To succeed in this England team Kane will need to play as he has at Bayern, as more of a classic 9 high up the pitch. England don't need him as playmaker. With Bellingham and Foden on the pitch there is a danger of clogging that area. Perhaps Kane's desire to drop deep is one reason those players have yet to really shine in that role. In this team, and for so many reasons, he needs to be the razor edge.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It wasn't what most would have chosen to do after the bitter Champions League semi-final elimination to Real Madrid, but it is a custom for the German club.\n\nIt wasn't the only new thing Kane had to endure. Although he has obviously experienced trophy disappointment on many occasions, it has never been when success was so expected. Kane had made the hard choice to leave Tottenham Hotspur for Bayern, only to suddenly find success wasn't coming easy for the perennial German champions. It did hit him. The striker still registered this most painful of seasons - as he put it himself - in the way he always does. He internalised it and persevered. It was why the banquet suited him more than most. It helped \"get on with it\", in the way he always does.\n\nThis has been Kane's admirably persistent attitude to every major disappointment of his career: the 2015-16 battle at Stamford Bridge, the 2018 World Cup miss against Croatia, the 2019 Champions League final, Euro 2020 heartbreak and that penalty miss against France in Qatar.\n\nIt is why Euro 2024 carries more of a resonance for Kane than any England player, for reasons beyond the simple fact he is the only member of the squad to have featured in every Gareth Southgate tournament bar Kyle Walker and John Stones. The Manchester City duo have won plenty in their careers, while Kane has instead been branded a \"loser\", to go with all manner of other dismissals. That is some of the wider significance of this tournament.\n\nConsequently, a Euro 2024 medal would mean far more for Kane than anyone else, especially in a country where he has only deepened his legacy as one of the game's great strikers - if not one of the great champions. A first season in Germany has brought 49 goals for club and country. Victory in Berlin on 14 July wouldn't quite be coming home but sending it home.\n\nKane now has a laser focus on exactly that outcome, which some of England's younger players have been struck by. Adam Wharton, who Bayern Munich also want, has been seeking his counsel. That attitude of perseverance, of just getting on with it, is why Kane has so consistently performed at the same level no matter what is going on around him or any personal disappointments. Kane hasn't dropped below 24 goals in a season since first properly breaking through for Spurs in 2014. That's an entire decade of a ratio of 0.7 goals per game: 382 in 545. Teammates describe it as \"almost robotic\". It is astounding.\n\nIn the same way Kane doesn't let any miss in any game affect the next chance, he doesn't let any setback affect the next campaign. Some in football describe this as the necessary \"delusion\" of the striker. Kane's great predecessors with England - Alan Shearer and Michael Owen - were said to have it in abundance. It was this astounding self-belief they would take the next chance. They could miss five and it wouldn't subdue them.\n\nThere is obviously some of that with Kane but it does feel a little different and deeper. He doesn't have an abrasive or arrogant character, after all. He is assertive but courteous, almost staid.\n\nThere's nearly a dutiful quality, like a soldier rather than a robot. That's perhaps why Kane excelled when Southgate put the squad through marine training to test their leadership skills all the way back in 2017. The striker stood out.\n\nIt all means he stands out in these Euros, too. For all of England's new generational talent, Kane offers something genuinely distinctive and perhaps old-fashioned - that may even soon be consigned to history. He guarantees goals. Kane is one of just five players picked for this summer's squads who has scored more than 50 for his country.\n\nThere's an irony to that, given Kane was previously talked about as a player who was bringing the No 9 role back. Instead, the tactical evolution of the game has ensured there's been a gap in the production line. So, while this isn't to say that the current young generation can't develop into finishers in the same way, Kane is one of very few players at these Euros with a record that brings an aura. It is why the forward remains Southgate's most important player. There is still a huge dependence on Kane for goals.\n\nThose numbers almost exclusively come from intelligent movement and extraordinarily precise finishing. Kane's innate instinct for goals has been honed so it's completely maximised. That is illustrated by how he still approaches finishes with a mindset that former Tottenham striker Clive Allen taught him early in his career. That is to shoot quickly, to catch goalkeepers out. Kane trained on this until it was seamless. It is certainly rare to see him struggle to get his feet right.\n\nHis technique may not be unparalleled, in the manner of the preternaturally gifted, but it is unerring. It has also evolved. One of the major factors with Kane is that he isn't just a No 9 for England but a No 10. The last three seasons have seen him grow into a creator as much as a finisher, with his assist numbers exploding.\n\nThere was a sense within the squad that this could have done with being recalibrated a bit after the 2022 World Cup. It wasn't quite Kane's fault but he was almost becoming too focal in play, slowing the team down. Part of that was because England suddenly had so many players that could operate in that area.\n\nThere are arguably even more now, with Jude Bellingham's rise meaning he is another who can fill that hole, just like Phil Foden.\n\nExcept, very suddenly, Southgate has decided to change the dynamic of the whole attack. Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling, Mason Mount, Jack Grealish and - admittedly less significantly - James Maddison and Jadon Sancho won't be there, to go with previous partners like Dele Alli. There is now a rare unknown over how exactly Southgate sets up for England's game first game against Serbia on Sunday.\n\nThere is no doubt about Kane, though. He has been the one constant through all of this, along with his goals. They come from a mindset where he immediately consigns every miss and every disappointment to history. He just gets on with it.\n\nEuro 2024 won't be Kane's last chance to win a major trophy, of course. But it might be the opportunity that means the most. Kane, for once, could do with a different finish.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For 12 members of the 26-man squad, this summer will represent their first experience of a major tournament and their first serious test at the highest level of the international game.\n\nBetween them, England's players for Euro 2024 boast a combined total of just 651 caps, compared to 830 caps in their squad at the 2022 World Cup. More than half of the appearances in this year's squad have been made by just five players: Jordan Pickford, Kyle Walker, Declan Rice, John Stones and Harry Kane.\n\nWith Southgate driving England on towards a bold new future, the seasoned players such as Kane, Pickford and Walker have, in some ways, become the outliers. They are accustomed to leading this team, to setting the example, but they must know that their experience and guidance will be more important now than at any other point in their international careers.\n\nDepending on your view, England's lack of experience is either a concern or an exciting sign of the huge amount of promise in Southgate's squad. Cole Palmer, Kobbie Mainoo, Eberechi Eze and Anthony Gordon have made a combined 14 international appearances, for example, but few supporters will be fretting about what they can offer. The potential is too exciting, the talent too obvious.\n\nIt is striking, though, that more than half of England's outfield players have never before experienced an international tournament. How will they handle the pressures of it? How will they deal with life in camp? How will they gel as a group? Southgate and his coaching staff will have strong ideas, of course, but no one can truly know the answers to these questions until the tournament is under way.\n\nKane, for his part, insists that there is no need to worry about the newbies. \"I think we have more than enough experience,\" he said. \"Especially a lot of players who have played in two or three tournaments now.\n\n\"There are always going to be new players, players who deserve to be here, players who are in their first tournament. It is about making sure they feel comfortable and they feel at ease when they are training or on the pitch, just to be themselves. We have more than enough.\n\n\"The lads who have played in a lot of tournaments have to step up and be there for the ones who need a bit of help.\"\n\nOf the 24 nations competing in this summer's tournament, only six will land in Germany with fewer combined caps than Southgate's England. Even more eye-catchingly, only two teams (Turkey and the Czech Republic) will arrive with younger squads.\n\nNine of Southgate's players are aged 24 or under, although in this case age does not necessarily equate to experience: Bukayo Saka, Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden are young guns but they are seasoned internationals compared to 32-year-old Lewis Dunk (six caps), 28-year-old Ivan Toney (three caps) and 27-year-old Jarrod Bowen (eight caps).\n\nTime will tell whether the absences of Harry Maguire, through injury, and Jack Grealish will shake the foundations of this England squad. Between them, those two players have played 99 matches for their country. Maguire, especially, has consistently proven he can thrive under the unique pressures of a major tournament.\n\n\"For those boys it is really hard, tough to take,\" said Kane of Maguire and Grealish. \"For Harry especially, being injured. I know how much England means to him and how much he loves representing his country. Of course it is sad to see them go but ultimately that is what you get for playing for England. The manager has to take tough decisions. Everyone here has earned the right to be here and has proven they deserve to be there.\n\n\"Everyone brings something different to the team and we are going to need all 26 players if we are going to be successful. There are a lot of fantastic players - players who have had really, really good seasons. You can't ignore that. Players at the top of their game, on high form, deserve to be playing for their country.\n\n\"Being England manager is not easy; you have a lot of tough decisions, a lot of players to pick from. You can only choose 26. We have done that and I think we have a fantastic squad. But as always, it is about how you handle the games and the tournament, how you handle the pressure. We are going to have to deal with that in the weeks to come.\"\n\nFor Kane, the twin demands of leadership and goalscoring have never been a burden. If anything, they have proven to be the opposite during his time as captain. But this year the pressure on him is even more intense than usual, partly because of the youthful nature of the squad and partly because there are so few players who have experience of scoring goals for England.\n\nOf Southgate's chosen 26, only Kane and Saka have scored more than four goals at international level. When compared to the other teams at the tournament, England have the joint-lowest number of players with five or more international goals, alongside Albania. Of the 100 goals scored by the current England squad, 74 were converted by Kane and Saka.\n\nOnce again, it points to the same theme: that this is an England team picked on what might be possible with talent and promise this summer, rather than what has been done in the past. It is certainly an adventurous and exciting approach by Southgate. Now the time is coming for his players to prove it can work.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Dunk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PIH7bQNUbUtgXlVtsIWyKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/b20994f96584b0bd2e4545b04c2ccdf1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9637980", "eventUri": "eng-9637980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The main reason England can win in Germany is because Southgate is the manager. He is damned with faint praise too often, but his record with England is hugely impressive, particularly when it matters most -- at major tournaments.\n\nRead More Manchester United goalkeeper Tom Heaton, 38, gets SHOCK call-up to England Euro squad in unique role\n\nIn the years since 1970, too often England have fallen apart when they reached the finals. Some managers, like Sven Goran Eriksson, picked favourites, even if they were out of form or carrying injuries that hampered their effectiveness. Others, like Fabio Capello, proved incapable of maintaining morale and making being with England enjoyable in tournament conditions.\n\nSouthgate comes into his own in tournaments because he is such a brilliant man-manager. That is why he is the best manager England have had since Sir Alf Ramsey.\n\nHe gets the best out of his players on the biggest stage. He brings them together. He moulds team spirit. He selects players not just for their talent but for their character and for their ability to get the best out of each other on a long trip away from home.\n\nHis biggest test in Germany is to find a way to camouflage the weaknesses in England's defence and resist calls to play a team of No 10s in front of Jordan Pickford.\n\nThis will almost certainly be his final tournament in charge of the national team and his record demands we keep faith with him.\n\nGareth Southgate is a huge asset and knows what it takes to lead a team at a major tournament\n\n2 - The Jude Bellingham factor\n\nAt the end of October last year, I went to Barcelona to watch Jude Bellingham play in his first Clasico for Real Madrid.\n\nWhen Barcelona took an early lead, I wondered if the story of the kid from Stourbridge taking Spanish football by storm was going to fall flat for a weekend, but Bellingham scored an equaliser with a venomous drive in the second half and then grabbed a winner in the dying minutes.\n\nHe is only 20, but there is something special about him that goes beyond his talents. He seems to have that gift that so many great players have of rising to the biggest occasions.\n\nHe is bound to be tired after the season he has just enjoyed at the Bernabeu and the emotional highs of winning La Liga and the Champions League, but he has been given a week to recover and there are five more days until England's opening game. This is not a one-man team, but his emergence has strengthened England's chances of winning tournaments immeasurably.\n\nHe is so gifted he could play almost anywhere on the pitch, but it was playing as an advanced midfielder under Carlo Ancelotti where he enjoyed his greatest success with Madrid last season and that is where he would cause the most damage for England.\n\nJude Bellingham is one of several superb players named within Southgate's 26-man squad\n\n3 - Harry Kane's star quality\n\nIf Kylian Mbappe is the best player in the world right now, Harry Kane is the best centre forward.\n\nHe is not always appreciated as much as he should be, but he is a player who has everything. He is not just the best scorer in the side, he is the best long passer of the ball as well. Kane is most people's favourite to win the Golden Boot in Germany, ahead of Mbappe, and he has the class and the ruthlessness to beat any defence.\n\nIt is a measure of his talent, and his mentality, that he excelled in his first campaign with Bayern Munich, even as their season collapsed around them. If England click, he and Bellingham could form a brilliant partnership in Germany.\n\nHarry Kane is the best centre forward in the world right now and his goals will be crucial\n\n4 - An easing injury crisis\n\nEngland have got a lot of players struggling with fitness, but if they can navigate their way through the group stage without sustaining more damage, it is possible that players like Luke Shaw, Bukayo Saka, Anthony Gordon, John Stones and Marc Guehi will play themselves into form and get the match fitness they are missing.\n\nEngland should get stronger, and more confident, the longer they stay in the tournament.\n\nEngland will hope players like Luke Shaw return to full fitness as the tournament goes on\n\n5 - Declan Rice's defensive acumen\n\nThe more evident it becomes that England are vulnerable in defence, shorn of Harry Maguire and saddled with fitness concerns about Stones and Shaw, the more significant it will become that England possess, in Declan Rice, a player who has evolved into one of the best holding midfielders in the world.\n\nRice has matured into an authoritative midfield general at Arsenal and even if some point out that he might be even better given free rein to attack as a No 8, he is too valuable as a shield for the defence to allow him that kind of latitude.\n\n6 - A wake-up call from Iceland\n\nThe defeat by Iceland at Wembley on Friday might just have done England, and Southgate, a whole heap of good.\n\nRead More Inside how Gareth Southgate is getting England fired up - including pop star secret performance\n\nThe manager pointed out after the match that he might have been spending too much time concentrating on what England can do with the ball, rather than remembering what they need to do without it, too.\n\nSouthgate has been criticised for his caution in the past, but the Iceland loss was a reminder why he cannot allow himself to be too adventurous in his selections, however sumptuous our pool of attacking talents may be.\n\nIceland was a reminder that England's defence cannot be left unprotected. It was a reminder that it would be foolhardy to play only Rice sitting in front of the back four and it was a reminder that England's positional discipline in midfield has to be much, much sharper.\n\nThe disappointing 1-0 defeat by Iceland last Friday could act as a wake-up call for England\n\n7 - Phil Foden is in the form of his life\n\nFor the first time in eight years, England are going into a tournament with the best player in the Premier League in their ranks.\n\nPhil Foden has been even more of a delight to watch than ever for Manchester City. It looks more and more likely that he will start on the left of three players behind Kane in the opening game against Serbia and, even if many feel he has never quite produced his best for England so far, he is too good a player for that not to change in Germany.\n\nWith the likes of Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, England are full of quality\n\n8 - Trent Alexander-Arnold's passing\n\nI mentioned earlier that Kane was the best passer in the team. If Southgate gets Trent Alexander-Arnold in the side, alongside Rice, he would take that honour.\n\nIt's more likely that Southgate, sobered by what he saw against Iceland, will play Conor Gallagher instead, but Alexander-Arnold showed in the warm-up game against Bosnia-Herzegovina that his passing can unlock any defence at whatever stage of the game he is introduced.\n\nIt is the kind of ammunition that both Kane and Bellingham will use with relish.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold is a generational talent and could bring something special in Germany\n\n9 - The rise of Cole Palmer\n\nIf Cole Palmer starts from the bench, what a substitute to have.\n\nFoden might be the Footballer of the Year in England, but Palmer did things with Chelsea last season that made the heart skip a beat. His skill on the ball is breathtaking, his vision is awe-inspiring and his ability to beat a man with a trick gets the crowd on its feet.\n\nIf he has to impact a game by coming off the bench, so be it. He would be the last player a tired midfielder would want to face.\n\nCole Palmer is a special talent and he may prove to be a game changing option from the bench\n\n10 - A hugely open tournament\n\nEngland do have weaknesses in defence, but there is no team without problems at this tournament.\n\nEngland also have Kyle Walker in defence, by the way, and he is still so good and so quick that he locks up one flank.\n\nThe field at these Euros is wide open. England, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal and Belgium could all win it, but none are dominant.\n\nEngland are the bookies' favourites. They came within a missed Kane penalty of beating France at the 2022 World Cup and Southgate's side have got better and richer in talent since.\n\nThere are plenty of nations to regard with respect, but there is nobody for England to fear.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

donned the famous jersey in 2016 and 2021.\n\nEngland greats Bobby Charlton, Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney wore it before him, as well as David Johnson, Peter Beardsley, Nigel Clough and Andy Carroll.\n\nKane failed to net in his first Euros in 2016, but was on target four times during England's run to the final three years ago before they lost on penalties to Italy.\n\nAfter picking up his package, Kane posed for a photo with Prince William.\n\nWilliam also visited the England players prior to their last major tournament - the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nOn that occasion, all 26 squad members, including midfield superstar Jude Bellingham, received packages with details of the previous players to wear their shirt number plus an inspirational final message from Southgate.\n\nIt wasn't enough to help them go all the way in the Middle East as they crashed out in the quarter-finals to France, with Harry Kane missing a late penalty to send the game to extra time.\n\nThe England skipper will hope for better luck this time around as the Three Lions aim to end their wait for tournament glory that stretches back to 1966.\n\nPrince William also presented packages to England's

Apart from these two nations, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Italy, and Belgium are remaining favourites, according to Opta Supercomputer.\n\nOpta Supercomputer shows that England has the maximum percentage of 19.9 per cent, follwed by France 19.1 per cent.\n\nHosts Germany has been awarded 12.4 per cent, Spain 9.6 per cent, Portugal 9.2 per cent, Netherlands 5.1 per cent, Italy 5 per cent, and Belgium got 4.7 per cent.\n\nHalf of Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024 have never played at a major tournament but captain Harry Kane said that everyone who made the cut deserved their place and there is enough experience in their ranks to be successful in Germany.\n\nHarry Maguire, who has 63 caps, and Jack Grealish (36 caps) were among those omitted as Southgate trimmed his squad to 26 players for the June 14-July 14 European Championship.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry Kane said England's shock 1-0 defeat against Iceland could be a \"nice wake-up call\", showing the scale of the task ahead of them at Euro 2024.\n\nGareth Southgate's men are among the favourites to win the tournament in Germany but Friday's farewell party at Wembley fell flat and the players were booed off in a half-empty stadium.\n\nIceland took a early lead through Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson and the visitors then had the better chances to extend their advantage as the hosts toiled at both ends of the pitch.\n\nEngland captain Kane knows lessons have to be learned ahead of their Group C opener against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday.\n\n30-year-old Kane said despite the defeat there was a lot of justified optimism among England fans that the Euro 2020 finalists could go one better this year.\n\nQ1.

But we're also a team that hasn't won a Euros before, so we're trying to make history here.\n\n\"That's a target we've set out to try to achieve, but we know there's going to be a long, hard road ahead. We need to make sure we get it right because, in these tournaments, if you're not quite on it 100 per cent, you can be punished.\n\n\"I think this squad is one of the best, if not the best, we've had, going on form and the domestic seasons a lot of us have had. We have incredible young talent coming through who are fearless and just want to get on the ball and play.\n\n\"I hope that the guys can lean on me and ask me questions, and if I can help them get through anything, then great.\n\n\"But we have such a good togetherness, we're always talking or having dinner together and there's always conversations being had, so that helps us.\"\n\nEngland also received a boost yesterday when defender John Stones returned to training after missing Wednesday's session due to illness.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/HB-OFF-PLATFORM-KANE-NOTE.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9637980", "eventUri": "eng-9637980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

All eyes now though will be on their clash with Serbia in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nJude Bellingham, a late arrival to the squad due to his Champions League commitments with Real Madrid, hasn't featured in either warm-up game but will be a key cog and joined up with the Three Lions before their flight to mainland Europe.\n\nGareth Southgate's future beyond the Euros remains unclear but he will be hoping to further his own legacy with victory in Germany. England go in among the tournament favourites as they bid to end their 58-year wait for tournament success, which dates back to 1966.\n\nEngland made the final of the last Euros, eventually losing to Italy in a penalty shootout at Wembley. In the last World Cup they were knocked in the last eight at the hands of France, who are set to be a semi-final opponent if both teams top their group and win their respective games en route to a potential final.\n\nExpectations have mounted as a young squad continues to blossom. Southgate boasts Harry Kane, Phil Foden and Bellingham as part of his 26-man squad. Foden and Bellingham were named the respective players of the year in the countries with which they ply their trade whilst Kane enjoyed a stellar year with Bayern Munich.\n\nEngland have had to deal with some injury setbacks over the past week though. The group that flew from Birmingham didn't feature Harry Maguire, who has been a stalwart during the Southgate regime.\n\nThe Manchester United centre-half couldn't shake off an injury issue which will cost him his place. John Stones, Marc Guehi and Lewis Dunk are among the options at the heart of dfence. Jack Grealish has also missed out following a below par year on a personal level with Manchester City.\n\nSouthgate's squad does include several new names as the likes of Anthony Gordon and Jarrod Bowen are rewarded for impressive seasons. Both men have regularly been in the goals and assists as they push for a starting berth this weekend. Ivan Toney, Cole Palmer and Eberechi Eze are also hoping for their first tournament outings.\n\nFollowing the clash with Serbia England will head to Frankfurt four days later to face Denmark, who will provide their toughest group test. On June 25 the Three Lions then take on Slovenia in Cologne, which will conclude their group stage efforts.\n\nSouthgate has made no secret of the fact his squad are by no means 100 percent healthy. Several players are dealing with niggles but he backed the squad to be in better shape come their Euros opener and believes they can improve considerably on their Iceland defeat.\n\nHe said on Friday: \"The physical side is a slight concern, we've got so many physical issues, but as I said we needed to get players out of the game on a precautionary level as well. That part of it will be better for next Sunday.\n\n\"We're focusing on all aspects, really, but we can't hide the fact we have got a lot of physical issues, it's plain for everyone to see. Nevertheless, we can be better than we were tonight and we have to be more compact, press better, and then take the chances we created.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

That is going to be the main thing - the hard work as a team, unity, togetherness and with everyone behind us at home.\"\n\nEngland's campaign begins on Sunday with their Group C opener against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen - ahead of games against Denmark and Slovenia - and Gareth Southgate's side remain one of the tournament favourites.\n\nTheir qualifying campaign struck a familiar cord, finishing unbeaten at the top of Group C, six points clear of Italy having completed an impressive home and away double over the Azzurri, their conquerors in the Euro 2020 final.\n\nThey notched 22 goals and conceded just four with Kane's eight strikes only bettered by Kylian Mbappe (nine), Cristiano Ronaldo (10) and Romelu Lukaku (14) in the Euro qualifiers as a whole.\n\nBut this part of the journey has not been an issue since England last failed to qualify for a major tournament - Euro 2008 - when hapless manager Steve McLaren watched on from under an umbrella on the sidelines as Croatia ended their finals hopes with a 3-2 win at a rain-drenched Wembley.\n\nThe problems generally arise when they arrive at the finals themselves. \"I feel like we are on the right path,\" insisted record scorer Kane, who has 63 goals in 91 England appearances. \"But as we all know as well, it is really difficult to win these tournaments.\"\n\nEngland's forward options in Germany will be among the most feared out of any of the countries lining up at Euro 2024 and have enjoyed superlative seasons at their respective clubs.\n\nTwo of their star players were plying their trade abroad, finding the back of the net with unerring accuracy and regularity; Kane notched 44 goals in 45 games at Bayern Munich, while Jude Bellingham's 23 in 42 earned him the Spanish player of the year award and helped Real Madrid seal a La Liga and Champions League double.\n\nIt was a similar story for the home-based attacking players: Phil Foden's 19 goals helped Manchester City secure a historic fourth Premier League crown in a row; Bukayo Saka hit 16 as Arsenal took the title race down to the final day; Cole Palmer's 22 for Chelsea was beaten only by Golden Boot winner Erling Haaland.\n\nEven England's backup forwards could show off impressive stats, with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins (32), Jarrod Bowen (22) at West Ham and Newcastle's Anthony Gordon (21) all registering more than 20 goal contributions.\n\nFinding the right combination out of that list of players is a nice problem for Southgate, although he will have a big call to make about who plays alongside Rice in midfield.\n\nManchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo has enjoyed a superb season but had a match to forget against Iceland. Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold's range of passing would be welcomed by the forward line but Southgate tends to prefer a more defensive-minded option next to Rice.\n\nWith previous choice Kalvin Phillips out of favour, he may prefer the hard running of Chelsea's Conor Gallagher while the eye-catching cameo of Adam Wharton in the friendly win over Bosnia-Herzegovina makes the Crystal Palace 20-year-old an outside, if exciting, choice.\n\nBut it is in defence where the major concerns lie. Kyle Walker provides experience and reliability at right-back but his Manchester City teammate John Stones has struggled with injuries and the centre-half was taken off at the break against Iceland after taking a knock to the ankle - a \"mainly precautionary\" move according to Southgate but a concern with the tournament fast approaching.\n\nPalace defender Marc Guehi, with 11 caps to his name, looks set to partner Stones ahead of Brighton's solid if limited Lewis Dunk, while the right-footed Kieran Trippier of Newcastle will deputise on the left with Manchester United's Luke Shaw still not match fit. Jordan Pickford of Everton remains firmly No 1 choice as goalkeeper.\n\nSince taking over as manager, Southgate has revitalised England, guiding them to a World Cup semi- and quarter-final - as well as the Euro 2020 showpiece - and yet there remains a sizeable section of Three Lions fans that believe he should have achieved more with the talent available.\n\nWhether Southgate will be in the dugout for the Uefa Nations League game away to the Republic of Ireland in September will be dictated by how the next few weeks pan out in front of an expectant nation.\n\n\"We know how much it means to the country and the fans. The nation comes together at this moment,\" said captain Kane on Monday. \"We are probably going into this as one of the favourites ... We need to prove we are one of the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gareth_cox@thenationalnews.com", "name":

I was in other camps and a lot of players have turned around and said how it was divided. Gareth made it feel like you weren't away from club football.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old is not the first to comment on the international manager's success in creating a sense of unity among the players, which England squads of the past famously lacked.\n\nFormer Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor, who made three England appearances between 2008 and 2009, told talkSPORT that club rivalries had once made training camps uncomfortable.\n\nSpeaking in 2023, he said: \"Going in the camp is what people hated doing -- not playing for your country -- that was a big achievement and honour.\"\n\nBut Young revealed there was no such problem in Russia under Southgate.\n\nHe continued: \"Everyone was together, there was mixing between players and staff. He just brought everyone back together.\n\n\"In previous years, it wasn't that way. How many players pulled out of camps? It wasn't through injuries, it was through just not wanting to go.\n\n\"Whereas now, it has been a pleasure to go and be in the squad. He just knew how to get everyone together.\"\n\nFollowers of the national team will be familiar with the various leisure activities enjoyed by England's players during their downtime at recent tournaments, including darts at Euro 2020 and a 'spelling bee' held by Bukayo Saka in Qatar at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nAnd Young explained that these team bonding moments were all made possible by the Southgate and his staff's creative thinking.\n\nThe 39-cap former international said: \"At the World Cup, you're in a hotel for however long you're in the tournament.\n\n\"When we arrived, I just remembered the staff, they had literally gutted the hotel and made it feel like home.\n\n\"There was pictures of your family in your room. There were sofa areas, the gym was massive, there were so many rooms that they took into account, listening to the players and what they wanted.\n\n\"Everything was there.\"\n\nPrevious England managers may have taken a hard line on family visits at tournaments, with former coach Fabio Capello reportedly banning wives and girlfriends from the World Cup in South Africa.\n\nBut according to Young, Southgate understood the importance of the players having a support network in place whilst on international duty.\n\nHe shared: \"Gareth knew, the day after the game, it was a cool down and then family could come to the hotel, you could see them.\n\n\"When you're at tournaments, it can be tough being away from family, but Gareth knew which way to make players feel at home.\"\n\nBayern Munich star Harry Kane was captain in Russia, a role he will continue this summer at Euro 2024, and he certainly led by example, as he netted six goals to win the Golden Boot.\n\nAnd Young was full of praise for the Three Lions skipper: \"He's a great captain. You see Harry Kane as a leader. You get it on the pitch and off the pitch.\"\n\nSouthgate's innovative methods meant that Kane did not have to shoulder the responsibility of leadership on his own however.\n\nYoung explained: \"We had four 'captains' who we would go to with any concerns among players.\n\n\"We would sit down with [assistant manager] Steve Holland and Gareth Southgate to air what players were saying.\"\n\nThe former England defender-turned-manager is now preparing for his fourth major tournament in charge as his squad look ahead to the upcoming Euros in Germany.\n\nAnd fans will hope that he has more game-changing strategies up his sleeve to help lead the bookmakers' favourites to some long-awaited silverware.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"},

Pavlovic said: \"I would attack the English. I would go up there and try to press them. Everyone has flaws, even the English.\n\n\"We saw how organised Iceland were able to threaten and defeat them. We are analysing everything and will prepare well.\n\n\"We have a difficult group. England have one of the best teams in the European Championship so the first game will be very difficult, But we have to prepare the best. Let's go for a positive result.\n\n\"What is England's strength? They have a lot of quality players, especially in attack. They score a lot of goals, they have outstanding players. It is their strongest weapon.\n\n\"Kane is an incredible player who had a great season, but if you want to stop such a player, you have to do it as a team. All together.\n\n\"There's also Jude Bellingham. He had a great season and is in top form. We have to be a team to do our best to stop these players.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game with Serbia, Kane also suggested that their opponents could cause them issues - if they weren't at their top level. He said: \"They're a team that can hurt you if you're not set up correctly and defensively they're really strong.\n\n\"They make it difficult for us with their moves and they have tall players so they can be very dangerous. If we're not careful it could be a difficult game for us so we need to make sure we get that right.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

It looks fantastic, the hotel is incredible and to be in Germany is a bit of a home from home.\n\nKane believes his arrival in Bavaria has also seen some Germans develop a fondness for Gareth Southgate's side.\n\n\"The reception I've had since I've been at Bayern has been incredible and ever since I've been in the hotel, I've had some of the staff come up and say hello,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm not saying they want England to win, but I think they have a little soft spot for us - now I'm here - and that's fantastic.\"\n\nKane is England's all-time leading goalscorer with an impressive 63 goals in 91 caps.\n\nHe will break another record when he leads the team out at the Veltins Arena on Sunday, becoming the first man to captain England into four major tournaments.\n\n\"Being England captain and leading the boys out is probably the highest privilege I can have as a player and I'll never take that for granted,\" he added.\n\n\"That feeling is truly one of a kind. It's an honour to do it for a fourth time. We've had a semi-final, a final and a quarter-final, so I'm hoping we go to the very end and go on and win.\n\n\"We've had some really good moments and I've personally had some really good moments, but ultimately we're here to win the Euros and that's hopefully what we can do.\n\n\"I'm excited. There's always excitement, especially when you get out to the host nation, settle into the hotel and see where everything is.\n\n\"Hopefully it's going to be our camp for a good four or five weeks.

You deserved it at the last Euros.\n\n\"You need some luck. You're going to get another penalty shootout because it's part of tournaments.\n\nEURO 2024 FREE BETS AND OFFERS\n\n\"But England now have so much experience that they should have the belief to get it done.\"\n\nIt seems, then, that the bitterness in this rivalry is largely a one-way street.\n\nAnd while many nations regard England's anthem 'Three Lions', with its 'football's coming home' chorus, as arrogant, Klinsmann says the song is loved and fully understood in Germany.\n\nThe Germans hijacked the Baddiel & Skinner/Lightning Seeds tune after winning the Euros at Wembley 28 years ago, after a Southgate penalty miss condemned England to a cruel semi-final defeat.\n\nAnd Klinsmann, who has managed Germany, the United States and South Korea at major tournaments, said: \"We adopted the song totally.\n\n\"I love it and I love the approach of the English fans to take it as their anthem. It still drives the fan culture -- this hope, this focus on 1966.\n\n\"You reach the knockout stage and that song, it's within you, it always comes out.\n\n\"It's not arrogant at all. It actually makes England very sympathetic to us. People smile at it, knowing they've been waiting for a trophy since '66.\n\n\"In 1990 and 1996 those semi-finals could have gone England's way, absolutely. And we know that.\n\n\"It's crazy when you go through those England teams, the quality of them.\n\n\"I don't think we felt we were superior. We just had a solidity, a confidence and a huge desire to win.\n\n\"In '96 especially, we weren't the best team, we knew that. We had a crazy amount of injuries and were struggling but somehow we battled through.\"\n\nKlinsmann has been a BBC pundit at recent tournaments, witnessing first hand the way Southgate's team surrendered leads in the 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia and the Euros final against Italy in 2021.\n\nHe said: \"I thought the moment was right in Russia. Everybody was really down after the game against Croatia. They needed to close it down and get into the final. Then Croatia turned it around in the second half.\n\n\"At the last Euros, you felt, 'This is it'. At half-time in the final, I gave an interview with the BBC and they asked, 'What do you do now?'.\n\n\"I said, 'Don't back off, keep on attacking, get the second goal because Italy can always get a goal out of nothing. Don't back off'. But that's what happened.\n\n\"Then in Qatar, it was a drama down to a missed penalty against France.\n\n\"But after the progression in the last three tournaments you should go to Germany and say, 'Let's get this trophy'.\n\n\"The level of confidence this English side will bring to Germany has matured and it's there for people to believe.\n\n\"Over these last three tournaments you have matured into the favourites' role and are comfortable with it. The team embraces that expectation.\n\n\"When I played against England in the 90s, it felt the team wanted to win a tournament so badly but fans and media were always trying to create negativity. There was so much noise around the team.\n\n\"From the outside we were always asking, 'Why is this?'. It was a big part of the culture in England. In the last ten years, I've seen this disappearing.\"\n\nKlinsmann is a huge fan of Kane, who scored 44 goals in his debut season for Bayern, and Bellingham, who has won the Champions League and LaLiga since leaving Dortmund for Real Madrid last summer.\n\nThe duo have not played together since October, with Bellingham rested for the shock 1-0 Wembley defeat by Iceland which sends England to Germany on a low note.\n\nBut Klinsmann said: \"Bellingham jumped this year to world-class level and hopefully he can transfer it to the national team.\n\n\"Real have many experienced players but he took over as the leader on the field. He said, 'Give me the ball, I'm not nervous in front of goal'.\n\n\"He should have the confidence to lead with England and build his partnership with Kane.\n\n\"Kane will win trophies with Bayern next season, there's no doubt. The way he settled in with the club and the people has been exceptional.\n\n\"He's the best ambassador England can have in Germany.\n\n\"On the pitch, he's like an automatic machine. And the way he introduced himself to the Munich lifestyle -- with a big beer at Oktoberfest and a white sausage for breakfast -- they adore him.\"\n\nBut Klinsmann believes Southgate could regret axing Jack Grealish from his 26-man squad.\n\nHe said: \"Grealish can change a game in two minutes, doing stuff nobody else can.\n\n\"Grealish is provocative, he goes at people, he has a bit of nastiness and I like that. If you're Gareth, that's what you should want -- so it's a big decision to leave him out.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

There was an incredible atmosphere inside the Carl Zeiss Jena stadium, which England had travelled to from their nearby HQ.\n\nSome fans had somehow acquired flags bearing the names of Hereford, Blackburn and Everton.\n\nRobert Loder, 13, said: \"If Germany can't win it then I really want England to be the champions. The class of players like Kane and Bellingham have made a real difference to how English players are regarded here in Germany.\"\n\nAfterwards manager Gareth Southgate and the squad all stayed to sign autographs. Every single youngster left with at least one signature. At one stage they were all so excited the stadium announcer had to appeal for calm.\n\nFrida Jaeger, 11, Helena Litton, 11, Paulina Roteman, 10 and Frieda Kurfels, 12, are all players for FC Carl Zeiss Jena under-12s. Frieda said: \"I love the England team - they have some great players. Today really is a once in a lifetime experience for us. It's very special.\"\n\nAll four girls said \"we would love England to win if Germany don't\" and Helena added: \"We love the England players. Jude Bellingham is brilliant and of course Harry Kane from Bayern Munich.\"\n\nFrida said: \"My uncle lives in England and I definitely want them to win if we don't.\"\n\nCoach Jacquelin Wiedenbrusch, 46, took her players from the SV Einheit Worbis club. Karl Fischman, nine, Jonas Rauben, eight, Hannes Grohman, nine and Franz Luster, nine Jonas said: \"We are so excited that England came to Jena. Everyone loves Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane.\n\nWill England win Euro 2024? Have your say below.\n\n\"It's great their success has brought all football fans together. We love the Premier League and it's great that English players are now successful in Germany.\"\n\nJan Fischmann, 42, was with his son and said simply: \"What a fantastic day for the boys.\" Fans watching included lifelong England fan Reinhard Lisker, 66, from Jena who unfurled an Everton banner alongside wife, son and grandson.\n\nGerman Reinhard said: \"I grew up as a boy in the old East Germany and we supported whichever team played against West Germany in those days. So I became an England fan the day they won the World Cup in 1966 and have never looked back.\n\n\"I'm proud to wear my England shirt today alongside my family, who all support Gareth Southgate's team and it's a thrill to see them in my home town. I'm a member of the England supporter's club - I've been to 15 games - and also a fan of Everton, who I've seen 142 times.\"\n\nAfter the session England players headed back to their hotel to prepare for Sunday's opening match against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen. The opening ceremony will take plane on Friday before Scotland's game with Germany in Munich.\n\nIt was revealed last night that the widow of football legend Franz Beckenbauer, will carry the trophy into the Munich Arena.\n\nKnown for leading West Germany to two World Cup victories, Beckenbauer, who died aged 78 in January, revolutionised football and even earned the nickname Der Kaiser - The Emperor.\n\nHis wife, Heidi Beckenbauer, will be joined by Bernard Dietz, 76, the 1980 European Championship-winning team captain.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Pavlovic said: \"I would attack the English. I would go up there and try to press them. Everyone has flaws, even the English.\n\n\"We saw how organised Iceland were able to threaten and defeat them. We are analysing everything and will prepare well.\n\n\"We have a difficult group.

Let's go for a positive result.\n\n\"What is England's strength? They have a lot of quality players, especially in attack. They score a lot of goals, they have outstanding players. It is their strongest weapon.\n\n\"Kane is an incredible player who had a great season, but if you want to stop such a player, you have to do it as a team. All together.\n\n\"There's also Jude Bellingham. He had a great season and is in top form. We have to be a team to do our best to stop these players.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game with Serbia, Kane also suggested that their opponents could cause them issues - if they weren't at their top level. He said: \"They're a team that can hurt you if you're not set up correctly and defensively they're really strong.\n\n\"They make it difficult for us with their moves and they have tall players so they can be very dangerous.

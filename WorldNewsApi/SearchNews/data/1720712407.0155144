Taking to Instagram over the weekend, the wife of Mets superstar Pete Alonso shared snaps of her time in London, where the Mets are battling the Phillies in a two-game clash. On Sunday, Haley posted a photo of her game-day fit \u2013 a custom white jacket featuring Alonso\u2019s No. 20 jersey number and jeans \u2014 before heading to London Stadium, where the Mets are looking to bounce back following Saturday\u2019s 7-2 series-opening loss. Alonso, 29, went 2-for-4 on Saturday. He\u2019s averaging .243 this season with a .801 OPS. Prior to Saturday\u2019s game, Alonso asked the local media some hard-hitting questions, notably if he could get a Sunday roast on a different day of the week. \u201cI\u2019m not necessarily sure, because Sunday we\u2019re leaving, unfortunately, so I know Sunday roasts are a thing, are they served like specifically on Sundays at places or can you get this at any time, like a London roast\u2026 and what\u2019s your best recommendation?\u201d the first baseman said Friday. The reporter replied that he believes \u201cyou can get them pretty much any time,\u201d and suggested \u201chave as much gravy as possible.\u201d The Mets will get a day off after Sunday\u2019s contest before hosting the Marlins in a three-game series starting Tuesday at Citi Field. The team is currently fourth in the NL East at 27-36. Mets owner Steve Cohen is keeping his focus on the present \u2014 and \u201con winning games\u201d \u2014 as the trade deadline looms later this summer. \u201cIf you got into the playoffs and you are four games under .500, it\u2019s nice to make the playoffs and anything can happen, you know that. But still we would say, \u2018Wow that was not optimal.\u2019 Probably not the way you would envision it. But a lot of games left. I think the team is starting to show signs,\u201d Cohen said Sunday. The Mets became sellers at last year\u2019s deadline, trading pitchers Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer to the Astros and Rangers, respectively. Alonso agreed to a one-year, $20.5 million deal in January to avoid arbitration with the Mets. He is set to hit free agency after this season. Alonso and wife Haley have been married since 2021 and will celebrate their third wedding anniversary in November.", "summary": "Haley Alonso is enjoying her time across the pond.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/sports/pete-alonsos-wife-supports-mets-during-london-clash-vs-phillies/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-qqgfhoie2-1717942690729.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717928397&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:28:01", "author": "Jaclyn Hendricks", "authors": ["Jaclyn Hendricks"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.206}

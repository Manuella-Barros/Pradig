Pandya was a notable omission in visuals of first batch of Indian team players and support staff departing for New York from Mumbai on Saturday night. A report in Cricbuzz on Sunday said, Pandya had been vacationing overseas at an undisclosed location after Mumbai Indians\u2019 campaign ended in IPL 2024 with a defeat to Lucknow Super Giants at the Wankhede Stadium, and is now on his way to New York to link up with the Indian team for the showpiece event starting from June 1. Pandya had a torrid time in IPL 2024, where he was constantly under the spotlight for his disappointing all-round performances post an ankle injury layoff and was even booed by the crowd in both home and away games. With the bat, Hardik amassed just 216 runs in 14 matches of IPL 2024 at an average of 18 and a strike-rate of 143.05. With the ball, he picked 11 wickets at an economy-rate of 10.75 and average of 35.18. A lot was expected from him as a leader, especially after he captained Gujarat Titans to IPL 2022 title and IPL 2023 runners-up finish. But Mumbai Indians finished at the bottom of the points table. The report added that Sanju Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Avesh Khan, who played for Rajasthan Royals in Qualifier 2 of IPL 2024 in Chennai on May 24, will join the team later, so as traveling reserve Rinku Singh, who will be playing in the IPL title clash on Sunday night. It also said Virat Kohli sought permission to join the squad late. Apart from Rohit, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and traveling substitutes Shubman Gill and Khaleel Ahmed, left for New York from Mumbai on Saturday night. India is set to play their lone warm-up game against Bangladesh at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on June 1. Their Men\u2019s T20 World Cup campaign begins on June 5 against Group A opponents Ireland in New York, followed by a highly-anticipated clash against Pakistan on June 9. India will then face co-hosts USA on June 12 in New York, before going to Florida to take on Canada on June 15 to wrap up their Group A league matches. India were the inaugural winners of the Men\u2019s T20 World Cup in 2007 and are aiming to claim the silverware for just the second time through the upcoming tournament. \u2013IANS nr", "summary": "<p>New Delhi, May 26 (IANS) India\u2019s vice-captain Hardik Pandya will be linking up with the Rohit Sharma-led side in New York on Sunday afternoon ahead of the upcoming Men\u2019s T20&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/hardik-pandya-to-link-up-with-indias-squad-for-t20-world-cup-in-new-york-report/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Hardik Pandya to link up with India\u2019s squad for T20 World Cup in New York: Report</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/hardik-pandya-to-link-up-with-indias-squad-for-t20-world-cup-in-new-york-report/\">Hardik Pandya to link up with India\u2019s squad for T20 World Cup in New York: Report</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/hardik-pandya-to-link-up-with-indias-squad-for-t20-world-cup-in-new-york-report/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/_AVI8027.JPG", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:19:23", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": 0.069}

for eunach maker.\n\nIn a victim impact statement, the man who complained to police, described Gustavson as a \"lunatic\" who had put together a \"slick, professional website\".\n\nThe police investigation led to the arrest of 10 men in London, Scotland and South Wales.\n\nDuring raids, officers found Gustavson's penis in a drawer in his home four years after it had been amputated.\n\nGustavson, a Norwegian national, also had to have his leg amputated in February 2019 after getting a man to freeze it and claimed \u00a318,000 in disability payments up until 2021.\n\nEarlier in mitigation, Rashvinderjeet Panesar said the breakdown of Gustavson's marriage was the \"trigger\" for his offending.\n\nThe defence barrister said: \"He had a desire to be the architect of his own body.\n\n\"His modification led him to feelings of empowerment.\n\n\"It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nGustavson had pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property.\n\nThe other six defendants had admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nPeter Wates, 67, of Purley, Surrey, a retired former member of the Royal Society of Chemists, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\nJanus Atkin, 38, of Newport, Gwent, who had been completing a veterinary course, was jailed for 12 years.\n\nIon Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, received five years and eight months imprisonment, and Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail.\n\nDavid Carruthers 61, and Ashley Williams, 32, of Newport, Gwent, were jailed for 11 years and four years, six months respectively.\n\nIn January, three men were sentenced after admitting causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson.\n\nDamien Byrnes, 36, from north London, was jailed for five years for removing Marius Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife on video at his home on February 18 2017.\n\nJacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, from Epsom in Surrey, was jailed for three years and eight months for freezing Gustavson's leg leading to the need for it to be amputated in February 2019.\n\nNurse Nathan Arnold, 48, from South Kensington, west London, received a two-year suspended sentence for the partial removal of Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel in the summer of 2019.\n\nKate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Marius Gustavson ignored the risks of performing unnecessary surgery on vulnerable men for sexual gratification and financial gain. He actively recruited participants through his website and was paid to stream the footage of these barbaric procedures.\n\n\"Whilst the victims in this case all seemingly consented to surgeries and amputations, the victim who bravely reported his assault to the police expressed serious regret regarding his procedure and the lasting impact it has had upon him. This clearly emphasises why such practices are unlawful.\n\n\"The severity of today's sentence should act as a warning to others that performing extreme body modifications is against the law and the CPS won't hesitate to prosecute these horrendous crimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "ludlowadvertiser.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ludlow Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

During the \"gruesome\" enterprise the ringleader's penis was found in a drawer - four years after it had been removed - and human testicles were discovered in the freezer of a Newport home raided in the investigation.\n\nMarius Gustavson and his acolytes - three of whom were from Wales - carried out male castration, penis removal, and other \"grisly\" procedures on an unprecedented scale, the Old Bailey heard. Procedures were videoed and posted on Gustavson's Eunuch Maker website which netted him more than \u00a3300,000 between 2017 and 2021.\n\nOn one occasion when Gustavson cooked \"what appeared to be human testicles which are then plated to be eaten\" and kept other body parts as \"trophies\", Judge Mark Lucraft KC said. Gustavson, 46, of Haringey, north London, admitted charges including conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. On Thursday Judge Lucraft sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 22 years. He said Gustavson had been the mastermind of the \"gruesome and grisly\", \"large-scale\", and \"extremely dangerous\" enterprise.\n\nA knife used by Damien Byrnes, 36, from Tottenham, north London, to remove the penis of Marius Gustavson, the ringleader of an extreme body modifications group\n\nSix other men received jail terms of between four and a half years and 12 years for their part in the plot. Judge Lucraft said: \"I am entirely satisfied that the motivation of all those involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\" Some of what happened was \"little short of human butchery\", he said.\n\nDuring a police raid on the Newport home of David Carruthers \"testicles were found in a chest freezer\", prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC previously told the court. Alexander Greenwood, defending Carruthers, said the testicles found in his freezer were Carruthers' own.\n\nBut for his connection with the \"spider web\" of Gustavson, Carruthers would \"never have troubled these courts\", Mr Greenwood said. Carruthers was also diagnosed with body identity integrity disorder and removed his own testicles, the court heard. \"He believed he was assisting those with the same condition\", his barrister said. Helping Gustavson with his body modification activities was a \"terrible mistake\", Mr Greenwood added.\n\nExtreme body modification is linked to a subculture where men become \"nullos\", short for genital nullification, by having their penis and testicles removed. Previously Ms Carberry said Gustavson was linked to at least 29 procedures.\n\nAfter one of them Gustavson cooked severed testicles for lunch which he ate in a salad he had prepared for himself, she said. He had taken various pictures from \"raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter\", Ms Carberry told the court. She added: \"There is also, we say, clear evidence of cannibalism.\"\n\nThe court heard Gustavson, who had two previous fraud convictions in Norway, offered to sell the severed penis of one of his victims for hundreds of pounds. According to court documents body parts were put up for auction online with a \"buy it now\" button.\n\nThe other defendants had admitted their part in the conspiracy relating to 13 victims, the youngest of whom was 16 years old. Ms Carberry said the defendants used a wide variety of tools such as clamps used for animal castration. Some 22,000 subscribers paid to access videos on the Eunuch Maker website with varying levels of membership from \"free\" to \"VIP\" which cost \u00a3100. Gustavson was arrested after he used a red hot iron to brand a man's calf with the letters EM - for 'eunuch maker'.\n\nJacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, from Epsom in Surrey, who was sentenced at the Old Bailey to three years and eight months in prison for causing GBH with intent\n\nIn a victim impact statement the man who complained to police described Gustavson as a \"lunatic\" who had put together a \"slick, professional website\". The police investigation led to the arrest of 10 men in London, Scotland, and south Wales. During raids officers found Gustavson's penis in a drawer in his home four years after it had been amputated.\n\nGustavson, a Norwegian national, also had to have his leg amputated in February 2019 after getting a man to freeze it and claimed \u00a318,000 in disability payments up until 2021. In mitigation Rashvinderjeet Panesar said the breakdown of Gustavson's marriage was the \"trigger\" for his offending. The defence barrister said: \"He had a desire to be the architect of his own body. His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nGustavson had pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property. The other six defendants had admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm:\n\nNurse Nathan Arnold, 48, from South Kensington, west London, who admitted the partial removal of a nipple with a scalpel in the summer of 2019 from Marius Gustavson\n\nPeter Wates, 67, of Purley, Surrey, a retired former member of the Royal Society of Chemists, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Janus Atkin, 38, of Newport, Gwent, who had been completing a veterinary course, was jailed for 12 years. Ion Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Scotland, received five years and eight months imprisonment, and Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail. David Carruthers 61, and Ashley Williams, 32, of Newport, south Wales, were jailed for 11 years and four years and six months respectively.\n\nIn January three men were sentenced after admitting causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson. Damien Byrnes, 36, from north London, was jailed for five years for removing Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife on video at his home on February 18, 2017.\n\nJacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, from Epsom in Surrey, was jailed for three years and eight months for freezing Gustavson's leg leading to the need for it to be amputated in February 2019. Nurse Nathan Arnold, 48, from South Kensington, west London, received a two-year suspended sentence for the partial removal of Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel in the summer of 2019.\n\nDamien Byrnes, 36, from Tottenham, north London, who was sentenced at the Old Bailey to five years in prison for causing GBH with intent, after he admitted removing the penis of Marius Gustavson\n\nKate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Marius Gustavson ignored the risks of performing unnecessary surgery on vulnerable men for sexual gratification and financial gain. He actively recruited participants through his website and was paid to stream the footage of these barbaric procedures.\n\n\"Whilst the victims in this case all seemingly consented to surgeries and amputations the victim who bravely reported his assault to the police expressed serious regret regarding his procedure and the lasting impact it has had upon him. This clearly emphasises why such practices are unlawful.\n\n\"The severity of today's sentence should act as a warning to others that performing extreme body modifications is against the law and the CPS won't hesitate to prosecute these horrendous crimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "gloucestershirelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gloucestershire Live"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Marius Gustavson and his acolytes carried out male castration, penis removal and other \"grisly\" procedures on an unprecedented scale, the Old Bailey heard.\n\nProcedures were videoed and posted on Gustavson's Eunuch Maker website which netted him more than \u00a3300,000 between 2017 and 2021. On one occasion when Gustavson cooked \"what appeared to be human testicles which are then plated to be eaten\" and kept other body parts as \"trophies\", Judge Mark Lucraft KC said.\n\nGustavson, 46, of Haringey, north London, admitted charges including conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. On Thursday Judge Lucraft sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 22 years.\n\nHe said Gustavson had been the mastermind of the \"gruesome and grisly\", \"large scale\" and \"extremely dangerous\" enterprise. Six other men received jail terms of between four and a half years and 12 years for their part in the plot.\n\nJudge Lucraft said: \"I am entirely satisfied that the motivation of all those involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\" Some of what happened was \"little short of human butchery\", he said.\n\nExtreme body modification is linked to a subculture where men become \"nullos\", short for genital nullification, by having their penis and testicles removed. Previously, prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC said Gustavson was linked to at least 29 procedures.\n\nAfter one of them, Gustavson cooked severed testicles for lunch which he ate in a salad he had prepared for himself, she said. He had taken various pictures from \"raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter\", Ms Carberry told the court.\n\nShe added: \"There is also, we say, clear evidence of cannibalism.\" The court heard Gustavson, who had two previous fraud convictions in Norway, offered to sell the severed penis of one of his victims for hundreds of pounds.\n\nAccording to court documents, body parts were put up for auction online with a \"buy it now\" button. The other defendants had admitted their part in the conspiracy relating to 13 victims, the youngest of whom was 16 years old.\n\nMs Carberry said the defendants used a wide variety of tools such as clamps used for animal castration. Some 22,000 subscribers paid to access videos on the Eunuch Maker website, with varying levels of membership from \"free\" to \"VIP\" which cost \u00a3100.\n\nGustavson was arrested after he used a red hot iron to brand a man's calf with the letters EM - for eunuch maker. In a victim impact statement, the man who complained to police, described Gustavson as a \"lunatic\" who had put together a \"slick, professional website\".\n\nThe police investigation led to the arrest of 10 men in London, Scotland and South Wales. During raids, officers found Gustavson's penis in a drawer in his home four years after it had been amputated. Gustavson, a Norwegian national, also had to have his leg amputated in February 2019 after getting a man to freeze it and claimed \u00a318,000 in disability payments up until 2021.\n\nEarlier in mitigation, Rashvinderjeet Panesar said the breakdown of Gustavson's marriage was the \"trigger\" for his offending. The defence barrister said: \"He had a desire to be the architect of his own body.\n\n\"His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nGustavson had pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property. The other six defendants had admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nPeter Wates, 67, of Purley, Surrey, a retired former member of the Royal Society of Chemists, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Janus Atkin, 38, of Newport, Gwent, who had been completing a veterinary course, was jailed for 12 years.\n\nIon Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Scotland, received five years and eight months imprisonment, and Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail. David Carruthers 61, and Ashley Williams, 32, of Newport, Gwent, were jailed for 11 years and four years, six months respectively.\n\nIn January, three men were sentenced after admitting causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson. Damien Byrnes, 36, from north London, was jailed for five years for removing Marius Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife on video at his home on February 18 2017.\n\nJacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, from Epsom in Surrey, was jailed for three years and eight months for freezing Gustavson's leg leading to the need for it to be amputated in February 2019. Nurse Nathan Arnold, 48, from South Kensington, west London, received a two-year suspended sentence for the partial removal of Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel in the summer of 2019.\n\nKate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Marius Gustavson ignored the risks of performing unnecessary surgery on vulnerable men for sexual gratification and financial gain. He actively recruited participants through his website and was paid to stream the footage of these barbaric procedures.\n\n\"Whilst the victims in this case all seemingly consented to surgeries and amputations, the victim who bravely reported his assault to the police expressed serious regret regarding his procedure and the lasting impact it has had upon him. This clearly emphasises why such practices are unlawful.\n\n\"The severity of today's sentence should act as a warning to others that performing extreme body modifications is against the law and the CPS won't hesitate to prosecute these horrendous crimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "bristolpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bristol Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_shaw@bristolpost.co.uk",

The charges relate to 13 victims who are being safeguarded by specialist detectives.\n\nJudge Mark Lucraft, the recorder of London and most senior judge at the Old Bailey, said as he announced the sentence: \"Gustavson, you are very much the mastermind behind this grisly and gruesome enterprise. The business you set up was one that was both busy and lucrative. As with all the others involved, you have no medical qualifications.\"\n\nHe added: \"The footage uploaded was extremely explicit and made available to paying subscribers no doubt so they could watch it for their sexual gratification [...] Like-minded individuals were recruited by you, Gustavson, to assist in what became a large-scale, dangerous, and extremely disturbing enterprise.\"\n\nThe prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC told the three-day sentencing hearing that there was \"clear evidence\" of cannibalism and that Gustavson had cooked testicles for lunch in an \"artfully arranged salad platter\". He also kept numerous body parts as \"trophies\" in a fridge at his home in Harringay, north London and \"sold\" severed genitalia online.\n\nThe court heard the procedures were carried out in \"amateur and dangerous\" ways with kitchen knives, surgical scalpels and implements designed to be used on livestock, leaving victims writhing in pain and needing medical attention.\n\nThe judge said: \"They are permanent and irreversible procedures and will have a long-term, lifetime effect on the ability of the victim to carry out their day-to-day activities.\"\n\nGustavson's film-production techniques began to take on a more and more professional feel as the number of procedures increased. The videos were uploaded to the website, and subscribers paid to watch, with varying levels of membership from \"free\" to \"VIP\", which cost \u00a3100, the court heard.\n\nThe scale of the operation Gustavson, a Norwegian national, and other \"like-minded individuals\" ran was \"without precedent\", Carberry said, saying it was \"impossible to know\" the full scale of the offending.\n\nThe court previously heard that the procedures are linked to a subculture where men become \"nullos\", short for genital nullification, by having their penis and testicles removed.\n\nIn a video of one incident, which was played in court, one of the group's victims was branded with the letters \"EM\", for eunuch maker, on the back of his calf. The man later complained to police about Gustavson and his \"circle of acolytes\", and an investigation was launched.\n\nIn a victim impact statement, the branded man described Gustavson as a \"lunatic\" who had put together a \"slick, professional website\".\n\nThe other six defendants admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nThe judge said: \"I am entirely satisfied that the motivation of all those involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\"\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property.\n\nPeter Wates, 67, of Purley, Surrey, a retired former member of the Royal Society of Chemistry, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.

The gruesome operations were uploaded to the 26-year-old Norwegian's \"eunuch maker\" website where subscribers would pay to watch.\n\nHe made nearly \u00a3300,000 over four years from the site's 22,841 subscribers around the world. The eye-watering practice is linked to a subculture where men become 'nullos' - short for genital nullification - by having their penis and testicles removed. During an earlier court hearing prosecutor Caroline Carberry, KC, said: '\"Gustavson set up a website on which he advertised extreme body modification services such as male castration and penis removal.\n\nA knife used to cut off Marius Gustavson's penis\n\n\"It is an incredible feature of this case the website operated in plain sight, not on the dark web, but accessible to anyone who stumbled upon it and had the inclination and the means to view the gruesome footage. This footage, which is extremely explicit, was uploaded.\n\n\"Users could pay to subscribe or buy individual videos. There is evidence the victims were promised a sum of money from the video revenue. Gustavson recruited like-minded individuals to assist him in his large scale, dangerous and disturbing enterprise.\n\n\"He was a manipulator of victims, who were themselves vulnerable. It is impossible to know how many procedures took place in the years when the Eunuch Maker website was active. Gustavson was involved in a minimum of 30 procedures.\"\n\nDefending Gustavson Rashvinderjeet Panesar told the court he had a desire to be \"the architect of his own body\" after his 11-year marriage broke down in 2016. The lawyer said: \"When it came to an end it sent him into a spiral. His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nGustavson had not participated in any body modification before the end of his marriage, Mr Panesar said. He now claims he wants to return to his native Norway, where his views are more likely to be accepted.\n\nDamian Byrnes was jailed last year Nathan Arnold admitted the partial removal of a nipple from Marius Gustavson\n\n\"Arch manipulator\" Gustavson, of Haringey, north London appeared for sentence alongside six other men who had all admitted their part in the lucrative scheme. The charges relate to 13 victims who are being safeguarded by specialist detectives. The wide-ranging conspiracy also involved the removal and trade of body parts, the court was told.\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, one count of making an indecent photograph of a child, one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child and possession of criminal property contrary to Section 329(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.\n\nIon Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Scotland, Peter Wates, 66, of Purley, Surrey, Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, David Carruthers 61, Janus Atkin, 38,

removed so they could become \"nullos\".\n\nGustavson made almost \u00a3300,000 through the extreme site, with some punters forking out \u00a3100-a-year subscriptions.\n\nIn one shocking video, the Eunuch maker - who had his own penis cut off, the tip of his nipple removed and his leg frozen so that it had to be amputated - is seen \"tasting\" a man's severed genitals.\n\nBody parts were also kept in a freezer at his North London home and his own manhood was discovered in a drawer four years after he sliced it off.\n\nGustavson has now been jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years after admitting conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nHe also pleaded guilty to one count of making an indecent photograph of a child, one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child and possession of criminal property.\n\nGustavson was described as an \"arch manipulator\" who recruited like-minded individuals to assist him with his gruesome work.\n\nThis included ten men who have been charged over their involvement in the procedures.\n\nDavid Carruthers, 61, Janus Atkin, 37, Peter Wates, 67 and Ion Ciucur, 30, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm between 2016 and 2022.\n\nWhile Ashley Williams, 32, and Stefan Scharf, 61, also pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nThe Old Bailey heard some of the severed body parts were sold, while others may have been eaten by Gustavson.\n\nProsecutor Caroline Carberry KC said there was evidence of \"cannibalism\" - with one video showing how he cooked testicles for lunch.\n\nShe added: \"The images, from raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter, were discovered by officers.\"\n\nGustavson carried out the procedures at his home in London, as well as in rented apartments or hotels.\n\nAs well as the money he made from the site, he also scrounged \u00a318,500 in disability benefits after amputating his leg.\n\nThe group used a \"wide variety of tools\" for their procedures - including those used for \"animal castration\".\n\nThe 13 victims - including a 16-year-old boy - were promised money from the video revenue.\n\nAlthough many of the men consented to the surgery, some were \"tricked\" or under the influence of drugs at the time.\n\nDuring a facetime call with a man in Sweden, Gustavson told him to \"maim himself\" by cutting off his testicles with a knife.\n\nGustavson told him: \"You know what to do come on, just push it.\"\n\nAnother victim was branded with the letters \"EM\", for eunuch maker, on the back of his calf.\n\nOne victim claimed Gustavson created a \"cult-like atmosphere\" around him, which was \"captivating and mesmerising\".\n\nThe man, whose testimony sparked a police probe in 2019, said he was left feeling like a \"monster, a mug, a degenerate and a freak\".\n\nRashvinderjeet Panesar, defending Gustavson, said the breakdown of his 11 year marriage in 2016, which had \"kept him stable\", was a \"trigger\" for his extreme activities.\n\nHe added: \"He had a desire to be the architect of his own body.\n\n\"His modification led him to feelings of

It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nThe lawyer said Gustavson had been diagnosed with body identity integrity disorder, which accounted for his desire to have body parts removed.\n\nGustavson had not participated in any body modification before the end of his marriage, Mr Panesar said.\n\nHe now wished to return to his native Norway, where his views are more likely to be accepted, Mr Panesar added.\n\nCaroline Carberry KC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey the men were involved in a \"lucrative business in the dangerous, unnecessary and life-changing surgeries carried out by non-medically qualified individuals - the nature and scale of which is without precedent.\"\n\n\"All of these individuals were active in the extreme body modification or mutilation scene and the consensual or mutilation of male genitalia,\" she added.\n\nProcedures were filmed with \"increasing professionalism\" and made available on the website set up by Gustavson, which also advertised services including male castration and penis removal.\n\n\"It is a remarkable feature of this case that the website was operating in plain sight - not on the dark web - accessible to anyone who stumbled upon it and had the inclination and means to pay to view the gruesome footage,\" she said.\n\nShocking images shown to the court revealed Gustavson's freezer filled with body parts stored in plastic bags and takeaway containers.\n\n\"It wasn't unusual for the excised genitalia to be kept by some of these defendants,\" she told the hearing.\n\nPolice officers also discovered Gustavson's own penis in a drawer at his home following his arrest in 2021 - almost four years after it had been amputated.\n\n\"Gustavson wasn't the only defendant to keep trophies from his surgeries,\" she added.\n\nMs Carberry KC said the group used a \"wide variety of tools\" for their procedures including clamps used for \"animal castration\".\n\nShe told the court that during a Facetime call with a man in Sweden, Gustavson told him to \"maim himself\" by cutting off his testicles with a knife. Gustavson told him: \"You know what to do come on, just push it.\" Three days later, Gustavson encouraged him to cut off his penis, the court was told.\n\nMs Carberry said Wates had been \"in the business of purchasing body parts from Gustavson\".\n\nDuring a police raid on the South Wales home of Carruthers, \"testicles were found in a chest freezer\", the prosecutor said.\n\nAlexander Greenwood, defending Carruthers, said the testicles found in his freezer were Carruthers' own. But for his connection with the \"spider web\" of Gustavson, Carruthers would \"never have troubled these courts\", Mr Greenwood said.\n\nCarruthers was also diagnosed with body identity integrity disorder and removed his own testicles, the court heard. \"He believed he was assisting those with the same condition\", his defence lawyer said. Helping Gustavson with his body modification activities was a \"terrible mistake\", Mr Greenwood added.\n\nAndrew Taylor, defending Atkin told the court his client had \"fallen under the spell\" of Gustavson.\n\nMr Taylor said: \"There are people in this country who are born into bodies they might not want. Mr Atkin's primary purpose was to help others. This truly is an epoch-making case.\"\n\nPaul Dixon, defending Wates, said the retired chemist was an \"altruistic individual who wanted to help\".\n\nTen men were arrested after police raids in London, Scotland and South Wales.\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, one count of making an indecent photograph of a child, one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child and possession of criminal property contrary to Section 329(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.\n\nCiucur, Wates, Scharf, Carruthers, Atkin and Williams all pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [],

for life", "body": "Mastermind behind site cut off his own manhood and kept it in drawer at home\n\nTHE cannibalistic ringleader of a \"Eunuch maker\" gang who chopped off victims' genitals to stream on a body modification site has been jailed.\n\nMarius Gustavson, 46, ate cooked testicles for lunch in an \"artfully arranged salad platter\".\n\nThe Norwegian national also masterminded a \"lucrative\" website where 22,841 users paid to watch men having their privates removed so they could become \"nullos\".\n\nGustavson made almost \u00a3300,000 through the extreme site, with some punters forking out \u00a3100-a-year subscriptions.\n\nIn one shocking video, the Eunuch maker - who had his own penis cut off, the tip of his nipple removed and his leg frozen so that it had to be amputated - is seen \"tasting\" a man's severed genitals.\n\nBody parts were also kept in a freezer at his North London home and his own manhood was discovered in a drawer four years after he sliced it off.\n\nGustavson has now been jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years after admitting conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nHe also pleaded guilty to one count of making an indecent photograph of a child, one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child and possession of criminal property.\n\nGustavson was described as an \"arch manipulator\" who recruited like-minded individuals to assist him with his gruesome work.\n\nThis included ten men who have been charged over their involvement in the procedures.\n\nDavid Carruthers, 61, Janus Atkin, 37, Peter Wates, 67 and Ion Ciucur, 30, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm between 2016 and 2022.\n\nWhile Ashley Williams, 32, and Stefan Scharf, 61, also pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nThe Old Bailey heard some of the severed body parts were sold, while others may have been eaten by Gustavson.\n\nProsecutor Caroline Carberry KC said there was evidence of \"cannibalism\" - with one video showing how he cooked testicles for lunch.\n\nShe added: \"The images, from raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter, were discovered by officers.\"\n\nGustavson carried out the procedures at his home in London, as well as in rented apartments or hotels.\n\nAs well as the money he made from the site, he also scrounged \u00a318,500 in disability benefits after amputating his leg.\n\nThe group used a \"wide variety of tools\" for their procedures - including those used for \"animal castration\".\n\nThe 13 victims - including a 16-year-old boy - were promised money from the video revenue.\n\nAlthough many of the men consented to the surgery, some were \"tricked\" or under the influence of drugs at the time.\n\nDuring a facetime call with a man in Sweden, Gustavson told him to \"maim himself\" by cutting off his testicles with a knife.\n\nGustavson told him: \"You know what to do come on, just push it.\"\n\nAnother victim was branded with the letters \"EM\", for eunuch maker, on the back of his calf.\n\nOne victim claimed Gustavson created a \"cult-like atmosphere\" around him, which was \"captivating and mesmerising\".\n\nThe man, whose testimony sparked a police probe in 2019, said he was left feeling like a \"monster, a mug, a degenerate and a freak\".\n\nRashvinderjeet Panesar, defending Gustavson, said the breakdown of his 11 year marriage in 2016, which had \"kept him stable\", was a \"trigger\" for his extreme activities.\n\nHe added:

A brave victim told officers about the procedures carried out on him, and provided around 5,000 WhatsApp messages and 100 images that saw deranged Marius Gustavson brought to justice for his horrific crimes.\n\nGustavson, 26, has now been jailed for life after carrying out castrations and other mutilations before uploading footage of them online. The Norwegian also removed men's penises, testicles and legs before sharing them on his \"eunuch maker\" website where subscribers would pay to watch.\n\nGustavson amassed close to 23,000 subscribers from around the world and made nearly \u00a3300,000 from his grotesque activities. He has now been jailed and must serve a minimum of 22 years before he can be released. The Old Bailey Heard how he kept a freezer full of men's body parts and cooked himself a testicle salad for lunch. Gustavson even froze his own leg off before claiming \u00a318,500 in disability payments.\n\nRead more:\n\nPolice hunt sex attacker after assault in Exeter city centre Devon guest house wins TV contest after hiker's shock move\n\nIt was the bravery of one of his victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, that led to his website being taken down. He told Devon and Cornwall Police how Gustavson cut him with a scalpel at his flat in North London.\n\nThe victim was \"high on drugs\" at the time and was also strapped to a bed and given electric shocks. During an earlier court hearing prosecutor Caroline Carberry, KC, said: '\"Gustavson set up a website on which he advertised extreme body modification services such as male castration and penis removal.\n\n\"It is an incredible feature of this case the website operated in plain sight, not on the dark web, but accessible to anyone who stumbled upon it and had the inclination and the means to view the gruesome footage. This footage, which is extremely explicit, was uploaded.\n\n\"Users could pay to subscribe or buy individual videos. There is evidence the victims were promised a sum of money from the video revenue. Gustavson recruited like-minded individuals to assist him in his large scale, dangerous and disturbing enterprise.\n\n\"He was a manipulator of victims, who were themselves vulnerable. It is impossible to know how many procedures took place in the years when the Eunuch Maker website was active. Gustavson was involved in a minimum of 30 procedures.\"\n\nDefending Gustavson Rashvinderjeet Panesar told the court: \"When it came to an end it sent him into a spiral. His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nGustavson had pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property.

Marius Gustavso, a self-styled 'eunuch maker', was the mastermind of a 'gruesome', 'large-scale', and 'extremely dangerous' group which performed 'extreme body modifications'.\n\nGustavson and his cronies carried out male castration, penis removal, and other 'grisly' procedures on an 'unprecedented scale', the Old Bailey heard. The procedures were filmed and posted on Gustavson's Eunuch Maker website, which bagged him more than \u00a3300,000 between 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe 46-year-old Norwegian, who admitted charges including conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, kept some body parts as \"trophies\", Judge Mark Lucraft KC said. The court had previously heard Gustavson was linked to at least 29 procedures.\n\nREAD MORE: Aldi \u00a335 air fryer that 'sold out within hours' now back in stock - here's how you can get it\n\nAfter one, Gustavson cooked severed testicles for lunch, which he ate in a salad he had prepared for himself - taking various pictures from 'raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter', with the court being told there was: \"Clear evidence of cannibalism.\"\n\nGustavson, of Haringey, north London, who had two previous fraud convictions in Norway, also offered to sell the severed penis of one victim for hundreds of pounds. Court documents showed body parts were put up for auction online with a 'buy it now' button. He was arrested after he used a red hot iron to brand a man's calf with the letters EM - for 'eunuch maker'.\n\nA victim impact statement from the man who complained to police described Gustavson as a \"lunatic\" who had put together a \"slick, professional website\". Ten men in London, Scotland, and south Wales were arrested as part of the police investigation, and during raids, officers found Gustavson's penis in a drawer in his home four years after it had been amputated.\n\nGustavson, who had to have his leg amputated in February 2019 after getting a man to freeze it, claimed \u00a318,000 in disability payments up until 2021, and claimed the breakdown of his marriage was a trigger for the offending. His defence barrister, Rashvinderjeet Panesar, said: \"He had a desire to be the architect of his own body. His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property. He was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 22 years on Thursday, May 9.\n\nSix other men received jail terms of between four-and-a-half years and 12 years after admitting conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. Their part in the conspiracy related to 13 victims, the youngest of whom was 16. The court heard the defendants used a tools including clamps used for animal castration. Around 22,000 subscribers paid to access videos posted on the Eunuch Maker website, which offered 'VIP' membership for \u00a3100.\n\n\"I am entirely satisfied that the motivation of all those involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward,\" said Judge Lucraft, adding that some of what happened was \"little short of human butchery\".\n\nThe six sentenced alongside Gustavson, who were arrested at addresses in London, Scotland, Birmingham and South Wales, were:\n\nPeter Wates, 67, of Purley, Surrey, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for conspiring to commit GBH Janus Atkin, 38, of Newport, Gwent, who was jailed for 12 years for conspiring to commit GBH Ion Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Scotland, who received five years and eight months imprisonment for conspiring to commit GBH Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail for GBH with intent David Carruthers 61, of Newport, south Wales, who was jailed for 11 years for conspiring to commit GBH Ashley Williams, 32, of Newport, south Wales, who was jailed for four years and six months for causing GBH with intent\n\nIn January three men were sentenced after admitting causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson. Damien Byrnes, 36, from north London, was jailed for five years for removing Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife on video at his home on February 18, 2017. Jacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, from Epsom in Surrey, was jailed for three years and eight months for freezing Gustavson's leg leading to the need for it to be amputated in February 2019. Nurse Nathan Arnold, 48, from South Kensington, west London, received a two-year suspended sentence for the partial removal of Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel in the summer of 2019.\n\n\"Marius Gustavson ignored the risks of performing unnecessary surgery on vulnerable men for sexual gratification and financial gain,\" said Kate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service. \"He actively recruited participants through his website and was paid to stream the footage of these barbaric procedures.\n\n\"Whilst the victims in this case all seemingly consented to surgeries and amputations the victim who bravely reported his assault to the police expressed serious regret regarding his procedure and the lasting impact it has had upon him. This clearly emphasises why such practices are unlawful. The severity of today's sentence should act as a warning to others that performing extreme body modifications is against the law and the CPS won't hesitate to prosecute these horrendous crimes.\"",

Earlier today, Judge Lucraft handed him a life sentence with a minimum term of 22 years.\n\nSix other men involved in the plot received jail terms ranging from four-and-a-half years to 12 years. Judge Lucraft stated: \"Gustavson, on the evidence you are very much the mastermind behind this grisly and gruesome enterprise.\n\n\"Like-minded individuals were recruited by you, Gustavson, to assist in what became a large-scale, dangerous, and extremely disturbing enterprise. The procedures were conducted in amateur and dangerous ways: in some instances it is little more than human butchery.\n\n\"Some procedures were overtly sexual or had clear sexual overtones. Many procedures clearly caused great distress and some resulted in the need for immediate emergency medical treatment. I am entirely satisfied that the motivation of all those involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\"\n\nExtreme body modification is linked to a subculture where men become \"nullos\", short for genital nullification, by having their penis and testicles removed.\n\nPreviously, prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC said Gustavson was linked to at least 29 procedures. After one of them, Gustavson cooked severed testicles for lunch which he ate in a salad he had prepared for himself, she said.\n\nHe had taken various pictures from \"raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter\", Ms Carberry told the court.\n\nShe added: \"There is also, we say, clear evidence of cannibalism.\"\n\nThe court heard Gustavson offered to sell the severed penis of one of his victims for hundreds of pounds. According to court documents, body parts were put up for auction online with a \"buy it now\" button.\n\nThe other defendants had admitted their part in the conspiracy relating to 13 victims, the youngest of whom was 16 years old.\n\nMs Carberry said the defendants used a wide variety of tools such as clamps used for animal castration.\n\nGustavson was arrested after he used a red-hot iron to brand a man's calf with the letters EM - for Eunuch Maker.\n\nIn a victim impact statement, the man who complained to police, described Gustavson as a \"lunatic\" who had put together a \"slick, professional website\".\n\nDuring raids, officers found Gustavson's penis in a drawer in his home four years after it had been amputated.\n\nEarlier in mitigation, Rashvinderjeet Panesar said the breakdown of Gustavson's marriage was the \"trigger\" for his offending.\n\nThe defence barrister said: \"He had a desire to be the architect of his own body.\n\n\"His modification led him to feelings of empowerment.\"\n\nDavid Carruthers, 61, Janus Atkin, 39, Peter Wates, 67 and Ion Ciucur, 30, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit GBH between 2016 and 2022.\n\nThey were jailed for 11 years, 12 years, 12 years, and five years and eight months respectively.\n\nAshley Williams, 32, and Stefan Scharf, 61, also pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and were each jailed for four and a half years, due to serve two-thirds before being removed on licence.\n\nJacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, Damien Byrnes, 36, and Nathaniel Arnold, 48, have all pleaded guilty to GBH and received sentences already of three years and eight months, five years, and two years suspended respectively.\n\nConsultant urological surgeon Chris Dawson, who gave advice on the case, stated: \"The procedures performed in these cases have highlighted the dangers involved in 'back-street surgery'.\"\n\n\"To become a highly qualified surgeon takes a number of years, and these procedures should not be carried out by anyone without the necessary experience or expertise as it risks serious complications such as significant bleeding, or sepsis.\n\n\"Penis removal is a complex procedure which is performed only by surgeons who have specialised in that area. If performed by an inexperienced person there would be a high likelihood of needing corrective surgery afterwards.\"\n\nClick for more of the latest news from across the world from the Daily Star.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_cailler@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Adam Cailler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Testicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Castration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lucraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Lucraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis_removal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penis removal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment in England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eunuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botulinum toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grievous bodily harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Haringey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Haringey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Haringey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body modification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orgasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Williams_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Williams (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Midlands"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32774803.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Castration-court-case.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553015", "eventUri": "eng-9553015", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Gustavson attracted nearly 23,000 subscribers globally and profited almost \u00a3300,000 from his macabre enterprise.\n\nREAD MORE Live: Search for missing South Bristol teenage girl\n\nREAD MORE 'End of an era' as Bristol nightclub announces shock closure\n\nThe Old Bailey was told of his chilling collection: a freezer stocked with male body parts and how he prepared a testicle salad for himself. Gustavson had even amputated his own leg and subsequently claimed \u00a318,500 in disability benefits.\n\nThe downfall of his gruesome operation was due to the bravery of an unnamed victim, whose identity is protected by law. This individual recounted to the police the harrowing experience of being cut with a scalpel by Gustavson in his North London flat.\n\nThe victim, who was \"high on drugs\" at the time, was also strapped to a bed and subjected to electric shocks. During a previous court hearing, prosecutor Caroline Carberry, KC, revealed: '\"Gustavson set up a website on which he advertised extreme body modification services such as male castration and penis removal.\"\n\n\"It is an incredible feature of this case the website operated in plain sight, not on the dark web, but accessible to anyone who stumbled upon it and had the inclination and the means to view the gruesome footage. This footage, which is extremely explicit, was uploaded.\"\n\n\"Users could pay to subscribe or buy individual videos. There is evidence the victims were promised a sum of money from the video revenue. Gustavson recruited like-minded individuals to assist him in his large scale, dangerous and disturbing enterprise.\"\n\n\"He was a manipulator of victims, who were themselves vulnerable. It is impossible to know how many procedures took place in the years when the Eunuch Maker website was active. Gustavson was involved in a minimum of 30 procedures.\"\n\nIn Gustavson's defence, Rashvinderjeet Panesar told the court: \"When it came to an end it sent him into a spiral. His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property. Six other defendants also admitted to the conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nPeter Wates, 67, from Purley, Surrey, a retired member of the Royal Society of Chemists, was handed a 12-year prison sentence. Janus Atkin, 38, from Newport, Gwent, who was studying veterinary science, received a 12-year jail term.\n\nIon Ciucur, 30, from Gretna, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison, while Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, was given a four-and-a-half-year jail term. David Carruthers, 61, and Ashley Williams, 32, both from Newport, Gwent, were sentenced to 11 years and four years six months respectively.\n\nEarlier this year, three men were sentenced after admitting to causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson. Damien Byrnes, 36, from north London, was jailed for five years for removing Marius Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife on video at his home on 18 February 2017.\n\nJacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, of Epsom in Surrey, was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison for causing Gustavson's leg to freeze, leading to its amputation in February 2019. Meanwhile, Nurse Nathan Arnold, 48, from South Kensington, west London, was handed a two-year suspended sentence for partially removing Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel in the summer of 2019.",

The charges relate to 13 victims who are being safeguarded by specialist detectives.\n\nJudge Mark Lucraft, the recorder of London and most senior judge at the Old Bailey, said as he announced the sentence: \"Gustavson, you are very much the mastermind behind this grisly and gruesome enterprise. It was a business which was both busy and lucrative.\"\n\nHe added: \"The footage uploaded was extremely explicit and made available to paying subscribers no doubt so they could watch it for their sexual gratification. It was a large scale, dangerous and extremely disturbing enterprise.\"\n\nThe prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC said there was \"clear evidence\" of cannibalism and that Gustavson, a Norwegian national, had cooked testicles for lunch in an \"artfully arranged salad platter\". He also kept removed genitalia as \"trophies\" in a fridge at his home in Harringay, north London, and \"sold\" body parts to others.\n\nThe three-day sentencing hearing heard that the procedures were carried out with kitchen knives or surgical scalpels and left victims writhing in pain and needing medical attention.

The man later complained to police about Gustavson and his \"circle of acolytes\", and an investigation was launched.\n\nIn a victim impact statement, the branded man described Gustavson as a \"lunatic\" who had put together a \"slick, professional website\".\n\nThe other six defendants admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nThe judge said: \"I am entirely satisfied that the motivation of all those involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\"\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property.\n\nPeter Wates, 67, of Purley, Surrey, a retired former member of the Royal Society of Chemists, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\nJanus Atkin, 38, of Newport, Gwent, who had been completing a veterinary course, was jailed for 12 years.\n\nIon Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Scotland, received five years and eight months imprisonment, and Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail.\n\nDavid Carruthers, 61, and Ashley Williams, 32, of Newport, Gwent, were jailed for 11 years and four years, six months respectively.\n\nIn January, three men were sentenced after admitting causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson.

The ringleader of an extreme body modifications website was driven towards the subculture by a desire to be \"the architect of his own body\" after his marriage broke down, a court has heard.\n\nThrough his \"eunuch maker\" site, Marius Gustavson and other \"like-minded individuals\" carried out multiple mutilations, \"the scale of which is without precedent\", prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC previously told the Old Bailey. The 46-year-old Norwegian required hospital treatment after having his penis and leg removed during body modification procedures.\n\nRashvinderjeet Panesar, defending Gustavson, said the breakdown of his 11 year marriage in 2016 which had \"kept him stable\", was a \"trigger\" for his extreme activities. \"When it came to an end it sent him into a spiral,\" Mr Panesar said.\n\n\"He had a desire to be the architect of his own body. His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nThe lawyer said Gustavson had been diagnosed with body identity integrity disorder, which accounted for his desire to have body parts removed. Gustavson had not participated in any body modification before the end of his marriage, Mr Panesar said.\n\nHe now wished to return to his native Norway, where his views are more likely to be accepted, Mr Panesar added. \"Arch manipulator\" Gustavson, of Haringey, north London, has previously admitted charges including conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nHe appeared for sentence alongside six other men who had all admitted their part in the lucrative scheme. The charges relate to 13 victims who are being safeguarded by specialist detectives.\n\nThe wide-ranging conspiracy also involved the removal and trade of body parts, the court was told. Ms Carberry said Peter Wates, a retired former member of the Royal Society of Chemists, had been \"in the business of purchasing body parts from Gustavson\".\n\nDuring a police raid on the South Wales home of David Carruthers, \"testicles were found in a chest freezer\", the prosecutor said. Alexander Greenwood, defending Carruthers, said the testicles found in his freezer were Carruthers' own.\n\nBut for his connection with the \"spider web\" of Gustavson, Carruthers would \"never have troubled these courts\", Mr Greenwood said. Carruthers was also diagnosed with body identity integrity disorder and removed his own testicles, the court heard.\n\n\"He believed he was assisting those with the same condition\", his defence lawyer said. Helping Gustavson with his body modification activities was a \"terrible mistake\", Mr Greenwood added.\n\nAndrew Taylor, defending Janus Atkin, who had been completing a veterinary course, told the court his client had \"fallen under the spell\" of Gustavson. Mr Taylor said: \"There are people in this country who are born into bodies they might not want.\n\n\"Mr Atkin's primary purpose was to help others. This truly is an epoch-making case.\"\n\nPaul Dixon, defending Wates, said the retired chemist was an \"altruistic individual who wanted to help\". Gustavson pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, one count of making an indecent photograph of a child, one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child and possession of criminal property contrary to Section 329(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.\n\nIon Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Scotland, Wates, 66, of Purley, Surrey, Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, David Carruthers 61, Janus Atkin, 38, Ashley Williams, 32, all of Newport, Gwent, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm.",

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA man known as the 'eunuch-maker' mastermind - who earnt nearly \u00a3300,000 - performing castrations on men in a London flat, has been put behind bars for life. Ringleader Marius Gustavson was responsible for carrying out ghastly procedures which included the removal of penises, testicles and legs, all to be shared with an online community of \"like-minded individuals\", a court was told.\n\nFootage of these horrifying operations was uploaded onto his website after he conducted them and users worldwide, 22,841 to be precise, would pay to view them. Gustavson, a 26-years-old from Norway, ran what he disturbingly titled his \"eunuch maker\" site where numerous people would watch practices that pertained to a niche subculture where men identified as 'nullos', meaning they underwent genital nullification by having their penis and testicles removed, reports the Mirror.\n\nIt was revealed in court that Gustavson maintained a freezer containing various male body parts and even prepared a salad using testicles for his lunch. He infamously amputated his own leg and had his penis removed, only to later claim disability payments.\n\nREAD MORE Arrests made as police smash doors down during crime crackdown\n\nThe judge sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 22 years before he could potentially apply for release. During previous court proceedings, prosecutor Caroline Carberry, KC stated: '\"Gustavson set up a website on which he advertised extreme body modification services such as male castration and penis removal.\"\n\nIn an eye-catching revelation, it was mentioned: \"It is an incredible feature of this case the website operated in plain sight, not on the dark web, but accessible to anyone who stumbled upon it and had the inclination and the means to view the gruesome footage. This footage, which is extremely explicit, was uploaded.\"\n\nObservations were made regarding the functionality of the vile site, such as: \"Users could pay to subscribe or buy individual videos. There is evidence the victims were promised a sum of money from the video revenue. Gustavson recruited like-minded individuals to assist him in his large scale, dangerous and disturbing enterprise.\"\n\nThe extent of Gustavson's active participation was emphasised: \"He was a manipulator of victims, who were themselves vulnerable. It is impossible to know how many procedures took place in the years when the Eunuch Maker website was active. Gustavson was involved in a minimum of 30 procedures.\"\n\nDefending Gustavson, his solicitor Rashvinderjeet Panesar said that after the breakdown of his 11-year marriage in 2016, he yearned to be \"the architect of his own body\". Mr Panesar elaborated: \"When it came to an end it sent him into a spiral. His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nInterestingly, according to Mr Panesar, Gustavson had not been involved in any form of body modification before his marriage ended. He now desires to go back to his native Norway, where his views are more likely to be accepted.\n\n\"Arch manipulator\" Gustavson, from Haringey in north London, appeared for sentencing alongside six other men who had all confessed to their involvement in the profitable scheme. The charges are connected to 13 victims who are currently under the protection of specialist detectives.\n\nThe court was informed that the extensive conspiracy also included the extraction and trade of body parts. Gustavson admitted to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, one count of creating an indecent photograph of a child, one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property contrary to Section 329(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.\n\nJudge Mark Lucraft, KC, the Recorder of London, stated: \"Gustavson you are very much the mastermind behind this grisly and gruesome enterprise. It was a business which was both busy and lucrative. You moved to the UK from Norway around 2012 and through your Eunuch Maker website began to advertise so-called body modification procedures. Many of the procedures carried out were filmed and over time the films were produced to an increasingly professional standard.\n\n\"The footage uploaded was extremely explicit and made available to paying subscribers no doubt so they could watch it for their sexual gratification. It was a large scale, dangerous and extremely disturbing enterprise.\n\n\"It appears the victims consented - but as the law in this country makes clear consent is not a defence to what took place. It may be some mitigation, but the performing of such medical processes by the unqualified is eminently dangerous and many may face lifelong issues.\n\n\"All the procedures were carried out by the medically unqualified in environments far from sterile. They were conducted in amateurish and dangerous ways. In some instances it is little more than human butchery. In some cases medical equipment is used, in others normal household implements were used. In some cases, equipment was used which is usually used to castrate livestock. Many videos were overtly sexual or had clear sexual overtones, many caused great distress and some resulted in the need for immediate emergency medical treatment.\n\n\"I am entirely satisfied the motivations of all involved was a mix of sexual gratification as well as sexual reward. In many of the filmed procedures the consequence is severe blood loss and many are in clear and acute pain. One is heard on film saying he does not want to die. To many of those looking at this case the activity at the very least will appear to be disgusting and abhorrent.\"\n\nIon Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Scotland, Peter Wates, of Purley, Surrey, Stefan Scharf, 61, of no fixed address, David Carruthers 61, Janus Atkin, 38, Ashley Williams, 32, all of Newport, Gwent, admitted to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nPeter Wates, a 67 year old retired chemist who participated in nine procedures, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison. David Carruthers, a 61 year old former surgical assistant known for keeping his own testicles in his chest freezer, received an 11-year sentence, while his husband Ashley Williams, 32, was sentenced to four years and six months for assisting him in removing a testicle from Janus Atkin, 39.\n\nAtkin, a 39 year old veterinary science student involved in eight procedures, was also handed a 12-year sentence. Stefan Scharf, a 61 year old German national, was sentenced to four years and six months for removing a man's testicle in Gustavson's Camden flat, while Romanian Ion Ciucur, 30, received a five-year and eight-month sentence.\n\nAnother gang member had previously confessed to freezing the leg of an alleged ringleader of an extreme body modifications group, resulting in the limb needing to be amputated. Jacob Crimi-Appleby, a 22 year old from Epsom in Surrey, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Marius Gustavson in February 2019.\n\nCrimi-Appleby was given a three-year and eight-month prison sentence.

It wasn't seedy, although he did subsequently build this little dungeon thing under the stairs.\n\nThe two-bedroom rental flat in a Victorian conversion in Harringay, north London, where Marius Gustavson carried out extreme body modifications\n\nMarius Gustavson and other members of his 'cult' cut off men's genitals, nipples and other limbs while streaming the footage online\n\nPeter Wates, 67, a retired former member of the Royal Society of Chemists, and David Carruthers, a 61-year-old retired hospital porter\n\nThe operations were filmed and uploaded to Gustavson's 'Eunuch Maker' website which subscribers would pay to watch\n\n'Aside from that, it was just like a normal flat. His bedroom was normal, clean, the wall was smothered with porn.'\n\nAndrew went on to explain how there was a picture frame above the bed which Gustavson displayed his removed testicles. It also had a sign on the door saying: 'Theo's playroom, open 24 hours, seven days.'\n\nRigged with cameras, it was where extreme body modifications were carried out by Gustavson such as a 'sub-incision' procedure on Andrew's penis in July 2020.\n\nDavid Carruthers, a 61-year-old retired hospital porter, was involved in six procedures including four testicle removals. He worked for Ceredigion and Mid Wales NHS trust from 1991 to 2002 but had no medical qualifications.\n\nHis boyfriend, 32-year-old Ashley Williams, also formed part of the butchery ring.\n\nGustavson's boyfriend, Jacob Crimi-Appleby, a 23-year-old from Epsom, froze off Gustavson's leg in February 2019 - forcing it to be amputated. The Norwegian would go on to claim \u00a318,000 in disability payments up until 2021.\n\nAlso involved were Damien Byrnes, a 36-year-old male escort from north London, who removed Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife at his home on February 18, 2017; Ion Ciucur, a 30-year-old Romanian; and 61-year-old German Stefan Scharf.\n\nRead More Ringleader of extreme body modifications cult who made \u00a3300,000 from his pay-per-view Eunuch Maker website that featured clips of castrations, penis removal and freezing of limbs, is jailed for minimum of 22 years\n\nNurse Nathan Arnold, 48, from South Kensington, west London, received a two-year suspended sentence for the partial removal of Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel in the summer of 2019.\n\nGustavson and his acolytes carried out male castration, penis removal and other 'grisly' procedures on an unprecedented scale, the Old Bailey heard.\n\nProcedures were videoed and posted on Gustavson's Eunuch Maker website which netted him more than \u00a3300,000 between 2017 and 2021.\n\nOn one occasion when Gustavson cooked 'what appeared to be human testicles which are then plated to be eaten' and kept other body parts as 'trophies', Judge Mark Lucraft KC said.\n\nA former friend of Gustavson's who gave his name as Andrew was once an administrator of the 'Eunuch Maker' website and went into the Norwegian's flat.\n\n'It was a nice flat,' he told the Guardian. 'It wasn't seedy, although he did subsequently build this little dungeon thing under the stairs.\n\n'Aside from that, it was just like a normal flat. His bedroom was normal, clean, the wall was smothered with porn.'\n\n'Andrew' described a picture frame about Gustavson's bed where he displayed his severed testicles.\n\nIt was in his bedroom that he carried out several of the extreme body modifications, including a 'sub-incision' procedure on Andrew's penis in July 2020.\n\nGustavson, who lived in Haringey, north London, and has been involved in LGBT activism, admitted charges including conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nToday, Judge Lucraft sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 22 years.\n\nHe said Gustavson had been the mastermind of the 'gruesome and grisly', 'large scale' and 'extremely dangerous' enterprise.\n\nDamien Byrnes, a male prostitute, was sentenced at the Old Bailey to five years in prison for causing GBH with intent\n\nAtkin and Williams pictured in mugshots released today by the Metropolitan Police\n\nSome of the vile messages Gustavson exchanged with site users\n\nSix other men received jail terms of between four and a half years and 12 years for their part in the plot.\n\nJudge Lucraft said: 'I am entirely satisfied that the motivation of all those involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.'\n\nSome of what happened was 'little short of human butchery', he said.\n\nExtreme body modification is linked to a subculture where men become 'nullos', short for genital nullification, by having their penis and testicles removed.\n\nPreviously, prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC said Gustavson was linked to at least 29 procedures.\n\nAfter one of them, Gustavson cooked severed testicles for lunch which he ate in a salad he had prepared for himself, she said.\n\nHe had taken various pictures from 'raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter', Ms Carberry told the court.\n\nShe added: 'There is also, we say, clear evidence of cannibalism.'\n\nThe court heard Gustavson, who had two previous fraud convictions in Norway, offered to sell the severed penis of one of his victims for hundreds of pounds.\n\nAccording to court documents, body parts were put up for auction online with a 'buy it now' button.\n\nThe other defendants had admitted their part in the conspiracy relating to 13 victims, the youngest of whom was 16 years old.\n\nMs Carberry said the defendants used a wide variety of tools such as clamps used for animal castration.\n\nSome 22,000 subscribers paid to access videos on the Eunuch Maker website, with varying levels of membership from 'free' to 'VIP' which cost \u00a3100.\n\nGustavson was arrested after he used a red hot iron to brand a man's calf with the letters EM - for eunach maker.\n\nGustavson's boyfriend Jacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, was jailed for three years\n\nRomanian man Ion Ciucur Ciucur (left) admitted conspiracy to cause GBH with intent in relation to two modifications. Stefan Scharf (right), a German, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail\n\nIn a victim impact statement, the man who complained to police, described Gustavson as a 'lunatic' who had put together a 'slick, professional website'.\n\nThe police investigation led to the arrest of 10 men in London, Scotland and South Wales.\n\nDuring raids, officers found Gustavson's penis in a drawer in his home four years after it had been amputated.\n\nEarlier in mitigation, Rashvinderjeet Panesar said the breakdown of Gustavson's marriage was the 'trigger' for his offending.\n\nThe defence barrister said: 'He had a desire to be the architect of his own body.\n\n'His modification led him to feelings of empowerment.\n\n'It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.'\n\nGustavson had pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, making and distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and possession of criminal property.\n\nThe other six defendants had admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nWates was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\nAtkin, of Newport, Gwent, was jailed for 12 years.\n\nCiucur, 30, of Gretna, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, received five years and eight months imprisonment, and Scharf, of no fixed address, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail.\n\nNathan Arnold, 48, from South Kensington, west London, admitted removing part of Gustavson's nipple\n\nCarruthers 61, and Williams, 32, of Newport, Gwent, were jailed for 11 years and four years, six months respectively.\n\nIn January, three men were sentenced after admitting causing grievous bodily harm to Gustavson.\n\nByrnes, 36, from north London, was jailed for five years for removing Marius Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife.\n\nCrimi-Appleby was jailed for three years and eight months for freezing Gustavson's leg leading to the need for it to be amputated in February 2019.\n\nArnold received a two-year suspended sentence for the partial removal of Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel in the summer of 2019.\n\nKate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'Marius Gustavson ignored the risks of performing unnecessary surgery on vulnerable men for sexual gratification and financial gain. He actively recruited participants through his website and was paid to stream the footage of these barbaric procedures.\n\n'Whilst the victims in this case all seemingly consented to surgeries and amputations, the victim who bravely reported his assault to the police expressed serious regret regarding his procedure and the lasting impact it has had upon him. This clearly emphasises why such practices are unlawful.\n\n'The severity of today's sentence should act as a warning to others that performing extreme body modifications is against the law and the CPS won't hesitate to prosecute these horrendous crimes.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Details of his sick crimes have come to light as he and his gang were sentenced\n\nA man who has today been jailed for life for selling sick videos of him chopping off other men's penises led a gang of 'Eunuch Makers' who carried out the horror surgeries.\n\nAs mastermind Marius Gustavson and his fellow amateur surgeons were each sentenced for their part in the bizarre crimes, seven sickening details of their crimes were revealed. Today he was jailed for life and must serve a minimum of 22 years behind bars.\n\nThe court heard that as ringleader he removed men's penises and testicles and wanted to share the clips with \"like-minded individuals\" on a scale the court heard was \"without precedent\". The gruesome operations were uploaded to the 26-year-old Norwegian's \"eunuch maker\" website where subscribers would pay to watch.\n\nRingleader froze off his leg and claimed \u00a318,000 in disability benefit\n\nGustavson, a Norwegian national, had to have his leg amputated in February 2019. He has asked another member of the gang to freeze it. Jacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, from Epsom in Surrey, was later jailed for three years and eight months for freezing the leg.\n\nGustavson went on to need the leg amputated and claimed more than \u00a318,000 in disability payments up until 2021 when the crimes came to light.\n\nOffered 'VIP access' to sick internet videos of live castrations for \u00a3100\n\nOne of Gustavson's victims told the court he was a \"lunatic\" who had put together a \"slick, professional website\". The website attracted more than 22,000 users worldwide who would pay to watch videos of castrations. He would even charge a VIP access price for people who could then watch a live penis amputation take place.\n\nDemanded man cut off his own testicles in perverse Facetime call\n\nProsecutor Caroline Carberry KC told the Old Bailey today during the sentencing hearing that in one Facetime call with a victim Gustavson.\n\nMs Carberry told the court that during a video call with a man in Sweden, Gustavson told him to \"maim himself\" by cutting off his testicles with a knife. Gustavson told him: \"You know what to do come on, just push it.\" Three days later, Gustavson encouraged him to cut off his penis, the court was told.\n\nKnife used by Damien Byrnes to remove the penis of Marius Gustavson Ate severed testicles for lunch as part of a salad\n\nAfter one procedure, Ms Carberry said Gustavson had \"cooked some testicles for lunch\" which he ate in a salad he had prepared for himself. Gustavson had taken various images from \"raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter\", the prosecutor said.\n\nBranded one of their victims with 'EM' for eunuch makers, as sick boast of their prowess\n\nIn a video played during the hearing of another incident, one of the group's victims was branded with the letters \"EM\", for eunuch maker, on the back of his calf. The man later complained to police about Gustavson and his \"circle of acolytes\", and an investigation was launched.\n\nKept his own severed penis in a draw at home for four years\n\nThe police investigation led to the arrest of 10 men in London, Scotland and South Wales, with Gustavson identified as the ringleader and owner of the website. During raids, officers found Gustavson's own penis in a drawer in his home four years after it had been amputated.\n\nDamien Byrnes, 36, from Tottenham, north London, was sentenced at the Old Bailey in January to five years in prison for causing GBH with intent after he admitted removing the penis of Marius Gustavson.\n\nDamien Byrnes was jailed for five years for cutting off Gustavson's penis Jacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, from Epsom in Surrey, who was sentenced at the Old Bailey to three years and eight months in prison for causing GBH with intent Sold severed body parts online complete with stomach-churning 'buy it now' button on website\n\nThe court heard Gustavson, who had two previous fraud convictions in Norway, offered to sell the severed penis of one of his victims for hundreds of pounds.

But, as a person cannot legally consent to the infliction of an injury causing bodily harm, the procedures amounted to a criminal offence even with consent.\n\nThe ringleader of an extreme body modification conspiracy who cut off men's genitals and uploaded videos to his \"Eunuch Maker\" website was jailed for a minimum of 22 years in a London court on Friday. Norwegian Marius Gustavson was involved in several highly dangerous procedures which included removing the penis or testicles of men who had consented, British prosecutors said.\n\nThe practice is linked to a subculture of men seeking to become so-called \"nullos\", short for genital nullification, by having their penis or testicles removed. Some of the procedures were filmed and the footage uploaded to Gustavson's pay-per-view website, which had nearly 23,000 users and made more than $300,000 between 2017 and 2021.\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty last year to 13 offences, including conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, and possessing criminal property relating to the money made from the website. Prosecutor Caroline Carberry said that all the men who were subjected to the operations had consented to the amputations.\n\nBut, as a person cannot legally consent to the infliction of an injury causing bodily harm, the procedures amounted to a criminal offence even with consent. Carberry also said that many of the victims were vulnerable and had been put under pressure by Gustavson and his co-defendants.\n\nGustavson himself willingly had his penis cut off at his London home in 2017 and later had his left leg amputated after deliberately submerging it in dry ice in 2019.

Marius Gustavson, 46, of Haringey, was jailed for life after a court found he masterminded the criminal group which butchered humans.\n\nThey carried out male castration, penis removal and other 'grisly' procedures on an unprecedented scale, the Old Bailey heard. Procedures were videoed and posted on Gustavson's Eunuch Maker website which netted him more than \u00a3300,000 between 2017 and 2021. On one occasion when Gustavson cooked 'what appeared to be human testicles which are then plated to be eaten' and kept other body parts as 'trophies', Judge Mark Lucraft KC said.\n\nGustavson, 46, admitted charges including conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. On Thursday, Judge Lucraft sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 22 years.\n\nREAD MORE: Mastermind 'eunuch maker' of 'human butchery' enterprise jailed for life\n\nHe said Gustavson had been the mastermind of the 'gruesome and grisly', 'large-scale' and 'extremely dangerous' enterprise. Judge Lucraft said: \"I am entirely satisfied that the motivation of all those involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\"\n\nSome of what happened was 'little short of human butchery', he said.\n\nExtreme body modification is linked to a subculture where men become 'nullos', short for genital nullification, by having their penis and testicles removed. Previously, prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC said Gustavson was linked to at least 29 procedures.\n\nAfter one of them, Gustavson cooked severed testicles for lunch which he ate in a salad he had prepared for himself, she said.\n\nHe had taken various pictures from 'raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter', Ms Carberry told the court. She added: \"There is also, we say, clear evidence of cannibalism.\"\n\nThe court heard Gustavson, who had two previous fraud convictions in Norway, offered to sell the severed penis of one of his victims for hundreds of pounds.\n\nAccording to court documents, body parts were put up for auction online with a 'buy it now' button. The other defendants had admitted their part in the conspiracy relating to 13 victims, the youngest of whom was 16 years old.\n\nMs Carberry said the defendants used a wide variety of tools such as clamps used for animal castration.\n\nSome 22,000 subscribers paid to access videos on the Eunuch Maker website, with varying levels of membership from 'free' to 'VIP' which cost \u00a3100.

It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.'\n\nThe lawyer said Gustavson had been diagnosed with body identity integrity disorder, and had not participated in any body modification before the end of his marriage\n\nAssisting him with the endeavour was a group of eight other men including a surgeon, three surgical assistants and a male escort, who have pleaded guilty to committing GBH.\n\nJacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, was jailed for three years and eight months, while Nathaniel Arnold, 48, was given a two year suspended sentence.\n\nBoth admitted to removing Gustavson's body parts.\n\nMale escort Damien Byres, 36, was also jailed for five years for cutting off Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife at his home on February 18, 2017, claiming such an act was on his 'bucket list'.\n\nExtremely graphic video footage of the event showed Gustavson gagged and strapped to the bed by Byres as he prepared to perform the procedure.\n\nProsecutor Caroline Carberry, KC told the court: 'Byrnes places a gag around Mr Gustavson's head and mouth and he kneels at the foot of the bed between Mr Gustavson's legs. He is wearing gloves and holding a red kitchen knife in his right hand.\n\nMs Carberry said: 'Byrnes holds it and pulls the tube out of it and shows it to Mr Gustavson who, once ungagged, tells Mr Byrnes to place the severed penis on his belly, which he does.\n\n'Mr Byrnes then lifts the severed penis and holds it towards Mr Gustavson's face. Mr Gustavson licks the end of it and declares that it is \"awesome\".\n\nThe court was shown a blurred 'selfie' video of Gustavson sucking on a severed penis.\n\nOther members of the group include Gustavson's right-hand-man, the surgeon Peter Wates, 67, Romanian Ion Ciucur, 30, German Stefan Scharf, 61.\n\nThe other three are former surgical assistant David Carruthers, 61, his boyfriend Ashley Williams, 32, and Janus Atkin, 39, all from South Wales.\n\nMORE : Dad protected himself in Hainault sword attack with 'pillows and teddy bears'\n\nMORE : Body found in park after search for missing teenager, 19", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_sanders@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Sanders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eunuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grievous bodily harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Body modification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Testicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Castration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Male prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amputation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nipple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refrigerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kensington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kensington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tottenham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_F._Byrnes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James F.

Gustavson: Mastermind behind 'eunuch maker' extreme body modification ring jailed for at least 22 years", "body": "The Norwegian national made almost \u00a3300,000 from a website that amassed 22,841 users who would pay to watch unnecessary surgical procedures.\n\nThe mastermind behind an extreme body modification ring that carried out procedures including castrations has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years.\n\nWarning: The following article contains graphic details of extreme physical mutilation\n\nMarius Gustavson, 46, ran a \"lucrative business\" sharing images of \"dangerous, unnecessary and life-changing surgeries\" carried out by people with no medical qualifications, the Old Bailey heard.\n\nThe Norwegian national made almost \u00a3300,000 through his open website \"eunuchmaker.com\", which amassed 22,841 users as it became increasingly professional.\n\nHe advertised his services, such as male castration, penis removal and freezing of limbs, while customers paid to view footage of the procedures or could take out a \u00a3100-a-year subscription.\n\n\"Arch-manipulator\" Gustavson had his own penis cut off, the tip of his nipple removed, and his leg frozen so that it had to be amputated, and recruited like-minded individuals to assist him, the court heard.\n\nGustavson, who claimed \u00a318,500 in disability benefits after losing his leg and now uses a wheelchair, appeared in court for sentencing by video-link from HMP Wandsworth.\n\nThe Old Bailey was told body parts, including testicles, were kept in takeaway tubs in his freezer, while Gustavson's own penis was found in a drawer in his home almost four years after it was amputated.\n\nThe judge said the activity would appear to many to be \"at least disgusting and abhorrent\".\n\nHe said the procedures, some of which were carried out with knives or surgical scalpels, were \"grave and life-threatening matters\" with \"permanent and irreversible\" results.\n\n\"Many of them may require extensive medical and other assistance for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nAn image of body parts kept in his freezer was \"no doubt what you would regard as the trophies of your acts of carrying out extreme body modifications\", he told Gustavson.\n\n\"You are very much the mastermind behind this grizzly and gruesome enterprise.\n\n\"The motivations of all were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\"\n\n'Clear evidence of cannibalism'\n\nProsecutor Caroline Carberry KC said he sold body parts, while there \"was clear evidence of cannibalism\" in the case and images found on Gustavson's phone from 22 June 2018 show \"he cooked some testicles for lunch\".\n\n\"The images, from raw ingredients to an artfully arranged salad platter, were discovered by officers,\" she said.\n\nGustavson, who was said to have been involved in almost 30 procedures, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm (GBH) between 2016 and 2022.\n\nHe also admitted five more counts of causing GBH with intent, making an indecent image of a child, possessing criminal property, possessing extreme pornographic images and three counts of distributing indecent pseudo-photographs of a child.\n\n'Cult-like atmosphere'\n\nNine other men have admitted their involvement with Gustavson's ring after one victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, went to police after feeling he was \"tricked\" into a procedure while under the influence of drugs.\n\nHe said in a victim impact statement Gustavson created a \"cult-like atmosphere\" around him, which was \"captivating and mesmerising\" and \"his veneer of respectability was a masterstroke\".\n\nThe prosecutor said the \"nature and scale\" of the procedures \"is without precedent\".\n\nOne victim was branded with EM - eunuch maker - while a dice game was played to decide what body parts would be removed from another.\n\n'Human butchery'\n\nSome required emergency medical treatment following procedures described by the judge as \"little short of human butchery\".\n\nThey were carried out at Gustavson's home in north London, rented apartments or hotels, and the victims, including a 16-year-old boy, were promised money from the video revenue, the court heard.\n\nProsecutors said many of the men who underwent procedures consented to them, while all of those charged were motivated by the sexual element of the offences and financial gain.\n\nWanted to be 'architect of own body'\n\nRashvinderjeet Panesar, defending Gustavson, said his \"desire to be the architect of his own body\" began during puberty before the recognition of body integrity dysphoria but the modifications were triggered by the end of his marriage in 2016.\n\nThe procedures gave him \"feelings of empowerment and greater acceptance of himself\" and he wanted to help others stuck in a body they wanted to make changes to and \"wished to put a smile on other people's faces,\" he said.\n\nThe barrister compared the practice to transgender operations but with \"people who want to be known as 'nullos' or of neutral gender\" and in circumstances \"where legal medical procedures haven't caught up\".\n\nMr Panesar said that what may be seen in the courtroom as \"depraved, dangerous, and unnecessary is the cost of happiness for others\".", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news",

Marius Gustavson's Eunuch Maker site, which operated on a pay-per-view subscription basis, had amassed over 22,000 registered users and brought in nearly \u00a3300,000 before it was shut down.\n\nCourt proceedings revealed horrific details of the body modification ring, which profited from explicit videos of men undergoing \"dangerous, unnecessary and life-changing surgeries,\" including the removal of male genitals.\n\nThe ringleader, Gustavson, 46, was personally involved in up to 30 procedures between 2017 and 2021 before he was arrested, and had kept dismembered body parts as 'trophies' in a freezer at his home.\n\nWhen handing down the sentence, Judge Mark Lucraft said Gustavson had been the mastermind of a \"large-scale,\" \"gruesome and grisly\", and \"extremely dangerous\" enterprise, which the judge described as \"human butchery.\"\n\nJudge Lucraft said he was \"entirely satisfied\" that the motivation \"was a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\"\n\nGustavson's legal defense argued on his behalf that he was suffering from body integrity disorder (BID) and was merely attempting to \"put a smile on people's faces\" by helping those similarly afflicted.\n\nRashvinderjeet Panesar, defending Gustavson, said: \"He had a desire to be the architect of his own body. His modification led him to feelings of empowerment. It appears at face value to be something that's become an addiction for him.\"\n\nOne victim, who spoke with Reduxx under the condition of anonymity, told of the psychological manipulation employed by Gustavson's website, which included a hierarchical rewards system that \"made it feel like a game.\"\n\nMen who had undergone a verified genital mutilation - whether removal of testicles, penis, or both - or limb amputation were awarded a profile badge that increased their status within the online community.\n\nThe victim who came forward presented his impact statement to the Old Bailey, and explained in terrifying detail being strapped down and administered testosterone blockers by Gustavson, which he said had the effect of altering his brain chemistry in a manner which made him \"more pliable to manipulation\" in the period leading up to the surgical sexual abuse.\n\n\"When I hear that people consented to these procedures I wonder what definition of consent they are going with, because I sure as hell did not consent to what happened to me that drug-fuelled night,\" the victim said. \"I would never have volunteered for castration by burdizzo.\"\n\nAlso mentioned in the victim impact statement is Gustavson's connections to \"cutters,\" amateur surgeons who castrate men for sexual gratification, operating in Berlin. One German man associated with Gustavson claimed that he castrated, or partially amputated the genitals of, eight men between July 2018 and March 2020, while on trial in 2021 for murder after one of his victims died.\n\n\"I experienced absolute terror bringing this matter to the police and pressing on with the formal complaint, while knowing I was putting myself on a direct collision course with Mr. Gustavson, his circle of acolytes, and his website where he was undoubted and unquestioned leader of some 20,000 users, and that a single message to his mailing list naming me as the reason for the closure of their playground could have had serious implications,\" the unnamed victim said.\n\n\"I felt sick knowing that the police were going to watch the video of my castration, imagining the laughter amongst the officers, but I knew it had to be done to stop anyone from being coerced into something that they would go onto regret,\" he added.\n\nThe victim, whose testimony was crucial to the case, also noted that NHS Scotland had uploaded a draft version of a document produced by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) to their official website which acknowledged \"eunuch\" as a gender identity.\n\nThe document was later pulled from the site and an official apology was issued. However, as previously reported exclusively by Reduxx, the guidance written by leading figures at WPATH had been created in collaboration with another group of men who operated in an online forum hosting sadomasochistic castration and child abuse content.\n\nLast December, Gustavson appeared at the Old Bailey Criminal Court in London via video link from HMP Belmarsh, where he has been detained during court proceedings, and admitted to charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nSix other men appeared in court and admitted their roles in the body modification fetish group. Among them were Peter Wates, a retired former member of the Royal Society of Chemists, and Janus Atkin, who was training to become a veterinarian.\n\nSeparately, Gustavson also pleaded guilty to making and distributing two indecent videos of a child between January 2017 and January 2020. The anonymous source involved in the court case recalled the \"wave of revulsion\" he felt after an officer told him that among the sadomasochistic pornography found on Gustavson's devices, there were also depictions of child sexual abuse.\n\nThe streaming genital mutilation media was part of a larger endeavor undertaken by a network of men who aided Gustavson and performed fetishistic amputations and other procedures for sexual gratification. Former nurses Nathaniel Arnold, 46, Jacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, and Damien Brynes, 36, assisted Gustavson with removing some of his own body parts, and have since been convicted.\n\nCrimi-Appleby used his access to medical supplies in order to freeze Gustavson's leg causing it to require amputation. Brynes removed his penis and Arnold facilitated the partial removal of one of Gustavson's nipples. Arnold also admitted stealing lidocaine while working as nurse at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital between January 2016 and January 2022, and possession of extreme pornographic images.\n\nBrynes, Arnold, and Crimi-Appleby have all admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Shockingly, a video presented in court showed Byrnes cutting off Gustavson's penis with a kitchen knife, while joking, \"Well, that's one off the bucket list.\"\n\nGustavson, who identifies as a \"nullo,\" had advertised on a gay hookup app seeking assistance in becoming a eunuch before offering Byrnes, an escort, \u00a3500 to carry out the procedure at his his Haringey flat on February 18, 2017.\n\nGustavson referred to Byrnes as a \"sexy, kinky helper\" and, in the days leading up to the surgery, claimed to have performed similar operations on over 26 individuals, removing both their penis and testicles. Byrnes admitted to performing the castration for financial gain, and the video was shared on Gustavson's website, which charged fees on a pay-per-view model.\n\nIn addition to the nurses, 66-year-old surgeon Peter Wates, referred to as Gustavson's \"right-hand man,\" was said to have played a role in nine out of the 29 known procedures. He also admitted to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.\n\nProsecutor Caroline Carberry told the court that \"the nature and scale\" of the \"lucrative business in the dangerous, unnecessary and life-changing surgeries carried out by non-medically qualified individuals... is without precedent.\"\n\n\"All of these individuals were active in the extreme body modification or mutilation scene and the consensual or mutilation of male genitalia,\" Carberry added. \"It is a remarkable feature of this case that the website was operating in plain sight - not on the dark web - accessible to anyone who stumbled upon it and had the inclination and means to pay to view the gruesome footage.\"\n\nHe also kept removed genitalia such as testicles as \"trophies\" in at his Harringay home and \"sold\" body parts to others. According to court records, body parts were put up for auction online via a \"buy it now\" button. The youngest victim identified was 16 years old.\n\nProsecutor Carberry KC said there was \"clear evidence\" of cannibalism and that Gustavson had apparently created an \"artfully arranged salad platter\" of cooked testicles. Carberry showed the court images of body parts stored in plastic bags contained in Gustavson's freezer and noted that \"it wasn't unusual for the excised genitalia to be kept by some of these defendants.\"\n\nFollowing his 2021 arrest, officers had discovered Gustavson's own penis tucked away in a drawer at his home, where he had been keeping his amputated member for four years. However, \"Gustavson wasn't the only defendant to keep trophies from his surgeries,\" prosecutor Carberry explained.\n\nShe also described a video call Gustavson conducted with one site user in Sweden wherein he instructed the man to \"maim himself\" by slicing off his testicles with a knife. Just three days later, Gustavson would then urge the man to remove his penis, as well.\n\nGustavson was initially arrested along with six other men in February 2022. Shortly after his arrest, he told The Independent in an interview that he had undergone an amateur orchiectomy himself and carried the operation out on 58 other men. He stated that he had his own genitals surgically removed because he wanted to \"look like a Ken doll with nothing down there.\"\n\nThe practice of removing the testicles or amputating the penis is linked to a male body modification fetish subculture known as \"nullification,\" and participants identify themselves as \"nullos\" or \"smoothies.\" While advertising his Eunuch Maker site and services online, Gustavson called himself Theo and described himself as a \"happy nullo.\"\n\nGustavson ran several social media accounts, using the handles @nullotheo, @ampunullotheo, @chubtheo, and @theo-eunuchmaker. His accounts on X were followed by men who identified as transgender, as well as those involved in chastity fetishism, eunuchdom, and nullification. On one account, he displayed a stylized \"non-binary\" pride flag in his header.\n\nA website owned by Gustavson, eunuchmaker.co.uk, sold graphic videos of castrations and amputations. Registered in 2016, it also offered the option of paid monthly memberships for streaming videos of penectomies. Premium subscriptions included the option of a \"free castration performed by the EunuchMaker.\"\n\nA registration form on the site listed possible \"gender identities\" based on sadomasochistic criteria. Among them were eunuch, nullo (nullification), and cutter, a euphemism for a person who performs male genital modification surgeries.\n\nPromotions on his primary platform direct visitors to another URL owned by Gustavson, Eunuchmaker.info. Archived versions of the page redirect to yet another online community, the-em.com, which is cited in criminal charges filed October 21, 2020, in the U.S. state of Oklahoma against two men who participated in fetishistic genital surgeries.\n\nBobby Lee Allen and his partner Thomas Evan Gates were charged with conspiracy to commit an unlicensed surgery, maiming, and failure to bury a dead human member, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.\n\nThe two men, self-described 'cannibals', removed the testicles of a 28-year-old Virginia resident as part of an illegally conducted gender reassignment surgery. Afterwards, according to court records, Allen laughed and told the victim he intended to consume his amputated members.\n\nAllen had claimed to have had 15 years of experience and several other patients lined up for future procedures. The victim further alleged that Allen boasted of leaving a man \"open\" to die after an operation. Allen and Gates had lured the man to their cabin by way of Gustavson's Eunuch Maker's website and forum.\n\nIn another grisly case involving Gustavson's forum, an elderly Florida man was sentenced to three years in prison following a bloody botched home castration he performed and recorded on camera, apparently intending to broadcast the footage through the Eunuch Maker site. Gary Van Ryswyk, 76, performed the genital surgery in August 2019 on a male victim, then aged 53.\n\nDespite the international coverage of the disturbing genital mutilation ring, media failed to note that Gustavson had been a prominent member of the LGBT activist community.\n\nAccording to Gustavon's LinkedIn profile, he was a volunteer and Senior Steward for London's Pride organization between 2016 to 2019. His first Eunuch Maker site was registered in 2016, and in 2018, he started a film production company called Nullset.\n\nPrior to his relocation to London in 2012, Gustavson was Chairman of the Board for the Buskerud chapter of transactivist lobbying group The Norwegian Organization for Sexual and Gender Diversity, now known as FRI. Gustavson was involved in a leadership position at the organization from 2001 through 2007. During this time, FRI went by the name 'The National Association for Lesbian and Gay Liberation,' or LLH.\n\nIn 2018, The Norwegian Organization for Sexual and Gender Diversity (FRI) successfully lobbied the World Health Organization to officially depathologize fetishism, sadomasochism, and fetishistic transvestitism by removing them from the 11th revision of the International Classifications of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11).\n\nThe initiative by LLH / FRI was called \"Revise F65,\" in reference to the classification category designated by the WHO's ICD guidelines. Listed under \"F65\" in version 10 of the manual were \"disorders of sexual preference:\" fetishism, transvestic fetishism, sadomasochism, voyeurism, and pedophilia.\n\nAt a 2004 LLH / FRI convention, the Revise F65 mandate was explicitly expressed in the organization's political platform. It was during this time that Gustavson served in a leadership position for the activist group.\n\n\"In addition to national work,\" the campaign's website states, \"Revise F65 also have an international mandate to motivate other countries to remove their national versions of the SM/fetish ICD diagnoses.\"\n\nReduxx is your source of pro-woman, pro-child safeguarding news and commentary.

We'd never asked about the fridge before but when [Gustavson] walked off with what looked [like something] a bit dodgy, we asked and he said: 'Oh yes, this is someone's penis, [it belongs to] this nice little twentysomething from Belgium.'\n\n\"But he didn't come back in with lots of cash. He used the money to buy pizza. It wasn't a lot.\"\n\nRelated: Man known as 'eunuch maker' who streamed mutilations is jailed for life\n\nGustavson, 46, originally from Norway, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 22 years at the Old Bailey on Thursday after pleading guilty to charges including conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm by performing extreme body modifications, including the removal of penises and testicles.\n\nThe court heard that life-threatening procedures were performed on vulnerable victims in non-sterile environments and broadcast on his website for the sexual pleasure of viewers.\n\nGustavson, who has had his penis, testicles, right nipple and left leg removed, was accused of being the principal offender, organiser and ringleader in the lucrative and wide-ranging conspiracy involving up to 29 offences on 13 victims and the trade of body parts.\n\nAndrew, an IT worker in his 30s whose name has been changed, witnessed the trade in the summer of 2021. \"In that fridge there were testicles and chopped-off penises pickled in a jar and kept cold, and people would turn up to buy them,\" he said.\n\nAs a one-time administrator on the website, Andrew had a unique insight into Gustavson's affairs and the procedures he carried out at his two-bedroom rental flat in a Victorian conversion in Harringay, north London.\n\n\"It was a nice flat,\" Andrew said. \"It wasn't seedy, although he did subsequently build this little dungeon thing under the stairs. Aside from that, it was just like a normal flat. His bedroom was normal, clean, the wall was smothered with porn.\"\n\nThere was also a picture frame above the bed in which Gustavson, known to his friends as Theo, displayed his removed testicles, and a sign on the door saying: \"Theo's playroom, open 24 hours, seven days.\" Rigged with cameras, it was where Gustavson carried out extreme body modifications, such as a \"sub-incision\" procedure on Andrew's penis in July 2020. Andrew allowed the act to be filmed and streamed on the website as payment.\n\n\"We took efforts to sterilise ... and the aftercare was good as well. I got sent home with antibiotics and sterile materials,\" Andrew said. \"He very much gave the impression that he'd done this before. He exuded confidence.\"\n\nDespite Gustavson's self-assurance, Andrew ended up going to hospital with complications, as did other consenting customers.\n\n\"Complications were a frequent occurrence at Theo's,\" said Andrew. \"Blood loss mainly, so people going in for something and then he couldn't stop the bleeding. I'm aware there was always a plan to drop people off at A&E in those kinds of cases. Some people ... especially for [those] having their penis removed, you can't kind of stop that in a home setting. So the plan was to do it and then go straight to hospital.\"\n\nThe Old Bailey heard the procedures were linked to a subculture where men become \"nullos\" - short for genital nullification - by having their penis and testicles removed. Gustavson claimed that the breakup of his marriage in 2016 awoke his previously \"dormant\" condition of body integrity dysphoria (BID) and drove him to commit the mutilations.\n\nAndrew said he was aware of at least 15 procedures that Gustavson had been involved in, including, he claimed, the removal of a woman's breasts.\n\n\"I also know he used to go abroad on holidays to do these things,\" said Andrew. \"It was an annual trip. They'd go to Germany and someone would rent out a room somewhere, and it was a group of cutters that would have arranged for people to come to that place and it was almost like a party. I only know because one year [Gustavson] couldn't go because he lost his passport and he was really angry.\"\n\nThe court heard that between 2017 and 2021 Gustavson made almost \u00a3300,000 through his website, which amassed a \"staggering\" 22,841 subscribers. Andrew said he believed the \"eunuch maker\" enterprise was Gustavson's only source of income and his mother had to help him pay rent. \"Theo wasn't living the high life,\" he claimed. He said Gustavson often offered discounted annual memberships for \u00a335 as part of new year and Thanksgiving promotions to lure customers in.\n\nThe website itself was popular owing to the abundance of free content, Andrew said. \"I first got involved because Theo was having trouble scaling the site due to the sheer number of visitors to it. The servers were literally struggling to cope,\" he said. \"We're talking a site that has 300,000 visitors a week, 10,000 to 20,000 active daily users. When we look at the Google Analytics for it, the only country that has never visited it was North Korea. This is a global thing.\"\n\nAndrew was arrested in November 2022 as part of the police investigation, codenamed Operation Vicktor, because he and his partner had had procedures done by Gustavson, but he was not charged. \"It was horrible. It was traumatising. It was absolutely horrific,\" he said of the months-long investigation.\n\nBrendan McCarthy, a body modification artist who was jailed for 40 months in 2019 after he partially removed one customer's ear, another's nipple and split the tongue of a third, said the Gustavson case was nothing like his. \"People may have thought what I did was extreme, but what they were doing I think should be stopped. That is something that is life-threatening,\" he said.\n\nThe court considered McCarthy's case when considering the extent to which consent is a mitigating factor. But the judge told Gustavson consent was not a defence to procedures that he described as \"little short of human butchery\".\n\nAndrew said he believed the group's conviction would only serve to drive the body modification practice further underground. \"Theo never saw that there was anything wrong with what he was doing. In his view, people were consenting, and that kind of overrode other concerns,\" he said. \"Theo genuinely believed he was helping them.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body modification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eunuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Testicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_stimulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual stimulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Castration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grievous bodily harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BDSM"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sterilization (microbiology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nipple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victorian era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Procedures", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Procedures", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Piercing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Piercing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Urban_Primitive", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Urban Primitive", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/1bc66163e6c58cc6729b3c60a8919683", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553015", "eventUri": "eng-9553015", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 2823, "textEnd": 2832}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

During the court hearing, he was described as \"a lunatic\", \"an arch-manipulator\" and \"a butcher\".\n\nHis pay-per-view website advertised services, including freezing of limbs.\n\nThe videos show Gustavson and his accomplices performing extreme body modifications on apparently willing volunteers in hotel rooms and flats in London. As per the BBC report, some of them were as young as 16.\n\nHis legal team said while defending him at the Central Criminal Court in London that Gustavson only wanted to \"put a smile\" on faces of those people who suffered, like him, from body integrity dysphoria (BID).\n\nBut prosecutors accused Gustavson of carrying out \"human butchery\" done for sexual, rather than psychiatric, reasons.\n\n\"We suggest that diagnosis - if it exists - may explain why it is Mr Gustavson acted as he did to have his own body maimed and mutilated, but does not explain why he made a lucrative business out of mutilating others,\" barrister Caroline Carberry KC was quoted as saying by the BBC.\n\nGustavson earned 300,000 pounds (Rs 3.13 crore) from his website and had 22,841 visitors from across the globe.\n\nSome of the subscribers even paid 100 pounds (Rs 10,000) yearly subscription for VIP status. The victims were promised money from the video revenue.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThere was also \"clear evidence\" of cannibalism by Gustavson, the prosecution claimed.\n\nHis network was destroyed by a brave victim, who has not been named for legal reasons. The participant told the police about the procedures carried out on him - and provided a USB stick that contained 5,000 WhatsApp messages, 100 images and a number of videos.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_chaturvedi@ndtv.com", "name": "Amit Chaturvedi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_modification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body modification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment in England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eunuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Castration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_dysphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body integrity dysphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grievous bodily harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/8bo63418_marius-gustavson-mutilator-1200_625x300_09_May_24.jpg?ver-20240506.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553015", "eventUri": "eng-9553015", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Users were offered a \"VIP\" yearly subscription of \u00a3100, along with free unlimited messaging.\n\nGustavson sought to blame his sado-masochistic behaviour on the break-up of his marriage in 2016, which he claimed had awoken his previously \"dormant\" condition of body integrity dysphoria, a rare mental health condition in which a person feels a limb or healthy body part should not be part of their body.\n\nNeither Gustavson nor any of his co-defendants were formally diagnosed.\n\nMany of the \"amateur and dangerous\" surgeries had been carried out on those identifying as \"nullos\", a term for people who do not wish to identify as male or female and, in Gustavson's words, want to \"look like a Ken doll, with nothing down there\".\n\nGustavson is wheelchair-bound after willingly having his penis, leg and nipple amputated, claiming \u00a318,500 in benefits from the Department of Work and Pensions for his self-inflicted disability.\n\nYet many of those who knew him in his past life, as an LGBT charity campaigner with a passion for the Eurovision Song Contest, think he has been unfairly vilified for his crimes.\n\n\"He is far from a monster,\" Gustavson's ex-husband told The Telegraph, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"I do want people to understand his background and who he is.\" He claimed Gustavson had done a lot of \"admirable work\" in his native Norway, and had been looked up to by his fellow charity workers.\n\nFriends and former colleagues described an isolated loner who dedicated all his spare time to gay activism in his home city of Drammen, a 45-minute drive south-west of Oslo.\n\nHe served as the regional chairman of Norway's National Association for Lesbian and Gay Liberation (LLH), once the country's largest LGBT group, and campaigned for more sex education in schools.\n\nAs the chairman of LLH Buskerud between 2003 and 2008, Gustavson hosted \"gay weekends\" in Drammen for four consecutive years and complained about school textbooks containing \"almost nothing about homosexuality\".\n\nHe regularly featured in his local paper, the Drammens Tidende, which he used to publicise LGBT events hosted by the LLH.\n\nIn 2007, he was pictured hosting one such event, attended by headteachers and school staff, at a hotel in Drammen. He said at the time: \"These professional groups have contact with people who are gay or lesbian. It is important to know how to meet young people who have a different sexual orientation.\"\n\nCamilla Lochen, a former member of LLH and co-host of the event, described Gustavson as a \"big teddy bear\". Ms Lochen, an assistant manager at a mining museum, told The Telegraph: \"He lived very much for that cause. My thought was maybe that he was a little miserable. He was a big boy. He had to have something to spend his time on.\"\n\nShe said it was \"horrible\" to learn of Gustavson's crimes in the UK, \"because he was a nice guy\".\n\nIn April 2005, Gustavson hosted another LLH event at Drammen's largest secondary school, calling for more gay sex education in the curriculum.\n\n'He was a regular colleague'\n\nGustavson graduated from a business school in Drammen in 1996, and shortly afterwards studied at a language school in Hastings, East Sussex, receiving an English certificate. He moved between Norway and the UK for several years afterwards and did odd jobs, including as a receptionist at the three-star Abbey Lawn Hotel in Torquay in the year 2000.\n\nHe had brushes with the law in his native country, committing several fraud offences but never being jailed. After a 2001 conviction, he worked for Norway's postal service for a decade. A former colleague described him as a private man who was \"passionate about LGBT causes\" and Eurovision.\n\nThe colleague, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \"We were just colleagues and did not see each other in spare time. He was a regular colleague, and I think most of us thought he was OK... I don't think he was spending any free time with his colleagues.\"\n\nAround October 2011, Gustavson emigrated to Bournemouth, working for Xerox as a customer care service manager until 2015 and later moving to Finsbury Park, north London.\n\nEven at the peak of his offending, Gustavson volunteered to help coordinate Pride marches through central London, acting as a senior steward between 2016 and 2019 and helping to register other volunteers. The prosecution admitted it was \"impossible\" to know the full extent of his offending between 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe court heard how Gustavson hoarded severed body parts in his freezer and auctioned them off online, with \"clear evidence\" of cannibalism as well as bodily mutilations.\n\nOn one occasion, he grilled a pair of human testicles in a skillet as part of an \"artfully arranged\" lunchtime salad with potatoes, pistachios and cashew nuts.\n\nInculcated 'cult-like' atmosphere\n\nHis crimes only came to light after one of his victims went to police, handing them a USB stick containing 5,000 WhatsApp messages between him, Gustavson and others, as well as a recorded interview. Gustavson was accused of using his \"coercive nature\" on the victim.\n\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, the man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said he was \"apoplectic with rage\" and wanted to kill Gustavson after realising the permanent damage done to his body.\n\nGustavson had inculcated a \"cult-like\" atmosphere that \"mesmerised\" his followers, who considered him their \"unquestionable\" leader, he said. He added: \"After the barbaric encounters, if I think about them too long I can still feel the physical pain.\"\n\nAlthough Gustavson's victims had given their \"consent\" to the procedures and he - in his lawyer's words - simply wished to \"put a smile on their faces\", this could not be accepted as a legal defence.\n\nUnder the Domestic Abuse Act 2021, a person cannot legally consent to being seriously harmed for sexual gratification.\n\nDespite atempts by Gustavson's co-defendants to argue that many of the surgeries had been performed solely for the psychological benefit of the victims, this was rejected by Judge Mark Lucraft KC, who said: \"I am entirely satisfied that the motivations of all involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\"\n\nGustavson showed little reaction during the three-day sentencing hearing, spending most of his time making copious notes on pieces of paper from the confines of HMP Wandsworth as he watched proceedings via video link on Friday morning.\n\nHis co-defendants - David Carruthers, 61, Janus Atkin, 39, Peter Wates, 67, Ion Valentin Ciucur, 30, Ashley Williams, 32 and Stefan Scharf, 61 - received jail sentences of between four and a half years and 12 years for their role in the plot.\n\nIn January, Damien Byrnes, 36, and Crimi-Appleby, now 23, were jailed for amputating Gustavson's penis and leg. Nathan Arnold, a 48-year-old nurse, was spared jail for removing Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel.\n\nGustavson, Carruthers, Atkin, Wates and Ciucur pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty to a range of further offences, including five additional counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, making an indecent image of a child, four counts of distributing indecent images of a child, possessing extreme pornographic images and possessing criminal property.\n\nWilliams and Scharf pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nKate Mulholland, a CPS specialist prosecutor within the London Complex Casework Unit, said: \"Marius Gustavson ignored the risks of performing unnecessary surgery on vulnerable men for sexual gratification and financial gain. He actively recruited participants through his website and was paid to stream the footage of these barbaric procedures.\n\n\"Whilst the victims in this case all seemingly consented to surgeries and amputations, the victim who bravely reported his assault to the police expressed serious regret regarding his procedure and the lasting impact it has had upon him. This clearly emphasises why such practices are unlawful.\n\n\"The severity of today's sentence should act as a warning to others that performing extreme body modifications is against the law, and the CPS won't hesitate to prosecute these horrendous crimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_stephens@telegraph.co.uk",

Users were offered a \"VIP\" yearly subscription of \u00a3100, along with free unlimited messaging.\n\nGustavson sought to blame his sado-masochistic behaviour on the break-up of his marriage in 2016, which he claimed had awoken his previously \"dormant\" condition of body integrity dysphoria, a rare mental health condition in which a person feels a limb or healthy body part should not be part of their body.\n\nNeither Gustavson nor any of his co-defendants were formally diagnosed.\n\nMany of the \"amateur and dangerous\" surgeries had been carried out on those identifying as \"nullos\", a term for people who do not wish to identify as male or female and, in Gustavson's words, want to \"look like a Ken doll, with nothing down there\".\n\nGustavson is wheelchair-bound after willingly having his penis, leg and nipple amputated, claiming \u00a318,500 in benefits from the Department of Work and Pensions for his self-inflicted disability.\n\nYet many of those who knew him in his past life, as an LGBT charity campaigner with a passion for the Eurovision Song Contest, think he has been unfairly vilified for his crimes.\n\n\"He is far from a monster,\" Gustavson's ex-husband told The Telegraph, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"I do want people to understand his background and who he is.\" He claimed Gustavson had done a lot of \"admirable work\" in his native Norway, and had been looked up to by his fellow charity workers.\n\nFriends and former colleagues described an isolated loner who dedicated all his spare time to gay activism in his home city of Drammen, a 45-minute drive south-west of Oslo.\n\nHe served as the regional chairman of Norway's National Association for Lesbian and Gay Liberation (LLH), once the country's largest LGBT group, and campaigned for more sex education in schools.\n\nAs the chairman of LLH Buskerud between 2003 and 2008, Gustavson hosted \"gay weekends\" in Drammen for four consecutive years and complained about school textbooks containing \"almost nothing about homosexuality\".\n\nHe regularly featured in his local paper, the Drammens Tidende, which he used to publicise LGBT events hosted by the LLH.\n\nIn 2007, he was pictured hosting one such event, attended by headteachers and school staff, at a hotel in Drammen. He said at the time: \"These professional groups have contact with people who are gay or lesbian. It is important to know how to meet young people who have a different sexual orientation.\"\n\nCamilla Lochen, a former member of LLH and co-host of the event, described Gustavson as a \"big teddy bear\". Ms Lochen, an assistant manager at a mining museum, told The Telegraph: \"He lived very much for that cause. My thought was maybe that he was a little miserable. He was a big boy. He had to have something to spend his time on.\"\n\nShe said it was \"horrible\" to learn of Gustavson's crimes in the UK, \"because he was a nice guy\".\n\nIn April 2005, Gustavson hosted another LLH event at Drammen's largest secondary school, calling for more gay sex education in the curriculum.\n\n'He was a regular colleague'\n\nGustavson graduated from a business school in Drammen in 1996, and shortly afterwards studied at a language school in Hastings, East Sussex, receiving an English certificate. He moved between Norway and the UK for several years afterwards and did odd jobs, including as a receptionist at the three-star Abbey Lawn Hotel in Torquay in the year 2000.\n\nHe had brushes with the law in his native country, committing several fraud offences but never being jailed. After a 2001 conviction, he worked for Norway's postal service for a decade. A former colleague described him as a private man who was \"passionate about LGBT causes\" and Eurovision.\n\nThe colleague, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \"We were just colleagues and did not see each other in spare time. He was a regular colleague, and I think most of us thought he was OK... I don't think he was spending any free time with his colleagues.\"\n\nAround October 2011, Gustavson emigrated to Bournemouth, working for Xerox as a customer care service manager until 2015 and later moving to Finsbury Park, north London.\n\nEven at the peak of his offending, Gustavson volunteered to help coordinate Pride marches through central London, acting as a senior steward between 2016 and 2019 and helping to register other volunteers. The prosecution admitted it was \"impossible\" to know the full extent of his offending between 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe court heard how Gustavson hoarded severed body parts in his freezer and auctioned them off online, with \"clear evidence\" of cannibalism as well as bodily mutilations.\n\nOn one occasion, he grilled a pair of human testicles in a skillet as part of an \"artfully arranged\" lunchtime salad with potatoes, pistachios and cashew nuts.\n\nInculcated 'cult-like' atmosphere\n\nHis crimes only came to light after one of his victims went to police, handing them a USB stick containing 5,000 WhatsApp messages between him, Gustavson and others, as well as a recorded interview. Gustavson was accused of using his \"coercive nature\" on the victim.\n\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, the man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said he was \"apoplectic with rage\" and wanted to kill Gustavson after realising the permanent damage done to his body.\n\nGustavson had inculcated a \"cult-like\" atmosphere that \"mesmerised\" his followers, who considered him their \"unquestionable\" leader, he said. He added: \"After the barbaric encounters, if I think about them too long I can still feel the physical pain.\"\n\nAlthough Gustavson's victims had given their \"consent\" to the procedures and he - in his lawyer's words - simply wished to \"put a smile on their faces\", this could not be accepted as a legal defence.\n\nUnder the Domestic Abuse Act 2021, a person cannot legally consent to being seriously harmed for sexual gratification.\n\nDespite atempts by Gustavson's co-defendants to argue that many of the surgeries had been performed solely for the psychological benefit of the victims, this was rejected by Judge Mark Lucraft KC, who said: \"I am entirely satisfied that the motivations of all involved were a mix of sexual gratification as well as financial reward.\"\n\nGustavson showed little reaction during the three-day sentencing hearing, spending most of his time making copious notes on pieces of paper from the confines of HMP Wandsworth as he watched proceedings via video link on Friday morning.\n\nHis co-defendants - David Carruthers, 61, Janus Atkin, 39, Peter Wates, 67, Ion Valentin Ciucur, 30, Ashley Williams, 32 and Stefan Scharf, 61 - received jail sentences of between four and a half years and 12 years for their role in the plot.\n\nIn January, Damien Byrnes, 36, and Crimi-Appleby, now 23, were jailed for amputating Gustavson's penis and leg. Nathan Arnold, a 48-year-old nurse, was spared jail for removing Gustavson's nipple with a scalpel.\n\nGustavson, Carruthers, Atkin, Wates and Ciucur pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nGustavson pleaded guilty to a range of further offences, including five additional counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, making an indecent image of a child, four counts of distributing indecent images of a child, possessing extreme pornographic images and possessing criminal property.\n\nWilliams and Scharf pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\n\nKate Mulholland, a CPS specialist prosecutor within the London Complex Casework Unit, said: \"Marius Gustavson ignored the risks of performing unnecessary surgery on vulnerable men for sexual gratification and financial gain. He actively recruited participants through his website and was paid to stream the footage of these barbaric procedures.\n\n\"Whilst the victims in this case all seemingly consented to surgeries and amputations, the victim who bravely reported his assault to the police expressed serious regret regarding his procedure and the lasting impact it has had upon him. This clearly emphasises why such practices are unlawful.\n\n\"The severity of today's sentence should act as a warning to others that performing extreme body modifications is against the law, and the CPS won't hesitate to prosecute these horrendous crimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_stephens@uk.news.yahoo.com",

The offences included removing a man's penis, clamping others' testicles, and freezing a victim's leg to the point of amputation.\n\nFormer NHS domestic assistant David Carruthers, 61, Janus Atkin, 39 - who had studied to be a vet - retired chemist Peter Wates, 67 and Romanian national Ion Ciucur, 30, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit GBH between 2016 and 2022.\n\nThey were jailed for 11 years, 12 years, 12 years, and five years and eight months respectively\n\nCarruthers' partner Ashley Williams, 32, and German Stefan Scharf, 61, also pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and were each jailed for four and a half years.\n\nJacob Crimi-Appleby, 23, Damien Byrnes, 36, and Nathaniel Arnold, 48, have already been sentenced - to three years and eight months, five years, and two years suspended respectively - all having pleaded guilty to GBH.\n\nThe court heard Gustavson was the \"willing victim\" when Byrnes cut off his penis, Crimi-Appleby froze his leg with dry ice so it had to be amputated in hospital, and Arnold removed the tip of his nipple.\n\nJudge Mark Lucraft KC said the procedures \"were done for sexual motives in addition to financial gain\" after Gustavson made thousands from the website and \u00a318,500 in disability benefits. He now uses a wheelchair.\n\n'Nullos and cutters'\n\nGustavson was part of an online subculture of \"genital nullification\" whereby \"cutters\" remove the genitals and other body parts of consenting \"nullos\".\n\nThe video played in court where Crimi-Appleby poured dry ice on his leg for two hours was entitled \"The Eunuch Maker Movie - A Null Set Production\".\n\nIn recent years, the most well-known case has been that of Japanese artist Mao Sugiyama who, at the age of 22 in 2012, willingly had his penis and testicles removed, before tweeting: \"Please retweet. I am offering my male genitals (full penis, testes, scrotum) as a meal for 100,000 yen... I will prepare and cook as the buyer.\"\n\nHaving been tested to confirm it was free of disease, he charged five diners around \u00a3160 to eat his penis.\n\nIn Gustavson's case, the court heard doctors considered diagnosing him with body integrity identity disorder (BIID) while he was in hospital recovering from his amputation, with his defence lawyer claiming a psychiatrist has now given him that diagnosis.\n\nDr Naomi Murphy, a consultant clinical and forensic psychologist, tells Sky News Gustavson appears to have a sexual sub-type of BIID.\n\nShe says in both cases, patients become fixated with a limb or body part and \"seek its amputation as they believe that will resolve all their problems\".\n\n\"It's a mental disorder - but the person isn't psychotic,\" she says. \"They know the part of their body is healthy but they don't feel right with it there.\"\n\nHigh-profile examples include Scottish surgeon Robert Smith, who in 2000 performed several amputations on patients he believed had BIID at the Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary. He was stopped, but argued they could have taken their own lives without the procedure.\n\nDavid Openshaw, from Australia, also froze his leg in dry ice for six hours, eventually forcing doctors to amputate it.\n\nIt mostly occurs in men, but there are cases in women.\n\nSeveral reasons people try to remove their penises\n\nDr Murphy was previously clinical director of a secure unit at HMP Whitemoor for people who had committed serious violent and sexually violent crimes.\n\nShe says there have only ever been 400 BIID cases documented worldwide and most present in an arm or a leg.\n\nWhile unable to comment on specific reasons in this case, she says of the documented cases involving penises: \"The two main reasons these people try to remove their penises is a history of childhood sexual abuse, whereby if as a child their penis became aroused, the adult can then become angry with it or feel betrayed by it, so want to remove it out of self-hatred.\n\n\"The other group is more associated with sexual taboos.\n\n\"Either they are taboo to themselves, for example, a homosexual who is holding a lot of internalised homophobia, or people who are sexually attracted to something that's illegal, so they attack their penises to reduce the risk of sexual assault.\"\n\nRead more from Sky News\n\nFootballer faces trial for racially-aggravated assault\n\nThe whole life prisoners who will never be released\n\nDr Murphy adds that BIID patients are often \"attracted to the idea of disability\".\n\n\"They've come to associate being disabled with care and nurturance. So amputation is an extreme way of forcing people to care for them.\"\n\nShe adds that this stems from a need for attention, often developed as a result of trauma, abuse or neglect in childhood.\n\nProfessor Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, says he believes the concept of \"expressive, transformative violence\" may also be at play.\n\n\"He may have thought the world saw him as insignificant or unsuccessful,\" he says. \"But by doing this to himself or someone else, doing it with competency, and making money out of it as well, he may have thought 'society should think carefully about how it considers me'.\n\n\"'I'm not a loser, I'm actually very dangerous and I'm competent'. He's trying to become something 'more' and is using violence to express that.\"\n\nIn mitigation, his defence lawyer said his body modifications gave him \"feelings of empowerment and greater acceptance of himself\".\n\n'Rare but nothing new'\n\nWhile cases of extreme body modification like this are rare, Professor Jackson says they are \"nothing new\".\n\nHe believes enterprises similar to Gustavson's go undetected worldwide that are \"much more successful and professionally run\".\n\n\"This isn't isolated or a one-off. There's a great fetishisation for body modification and missing limbs on the dark web.\n\n\"So the defendant was essentially a content provider and would have known he had to keep providing content that people would keep paying for - so wanted something more extreme and more graphic.\n\n\"They weren't using high-tech encrypted sophistication. There will be smarter, more professional outfits around the world that are nowhere near being detected.\"\n\nThe recruitment of someone who works in a medical environment isn't uncommon in cases of extreme body modification, he adds.\n\nCo-defendant Nathaniel Arnold, who removed Gustavson's nipple, was a nurse at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where he stole local anaesthetic. He pleaded guilty to the theft of lidocaine.\n\nProfessor Jackson said that while vetting operations have been stepped up in policing, pre-employment screening of doctors and nurses \"have never been very successful at filtering out individuals who go on to use their profession to offend\".\n\n\"Whether it's pills on the black market, stealing of scalpels and other surgical tools, these are offences that happen a lot more than people are willing to recognise.\"\n\nRisk to unwitting dark web users\n\nGustavson, his co-defendants, and their victims may have given consent, but that \"should not be used as a defence\", criminologist Dr Elena Martellozzo says.\n\n\"No one should be able to give consent to anything like this,\" the associate professor in criminology at Middlesex University tells Sky News.\n\nWhile Gustavson was a willing victim himself, he encouraged his 'cutters' to carry out the offences, which is against the law.\n\nShe also warns that those who may have been inadvertently exposed to the content online have not given theirs.\n\n\"There is a very important point here about the significant risk that these recordings could find their way back to the dark web, which is notoriously difficult to monitor and regulate.\n\n\"They pose a grave danger to vulnerable individuals, including young people, who may encounter this distressing content online.\"\n\nShe adds that some may seek to engage in copycat offences, while others could get into legal trouble for having such extreme content in their internet search history.\n\nCrimes 'unusual - even by prison standards'\n\nAside from problems left behind by his content, Professor Jackson believes Gustavson presents challenges himself.\n\nHe argues that with personality disorders so highly prevalent in prisons, other prisoners with mental ill-health issues or disordered personalities may be susceptible to being recruited by someone with BIID.\n\nProfessor Jackson believes Gustavson could present a challenge for the prison system because he could be a danger to other prisoners as well as himself.\n\n\"He's going to come across a lot of people with mental disorders or substance issues who may also be led to believe they don't need their penises or other limbs and would be willing to trade them within the prison environment.\"\n\nDr Murphy, who has worked with diagnosed psychopaths, says these offences will be seen as \"unusual - even by prison standards\".\n\nIn terms of potential treatment and rehabilitation for such offences, she adds: \"S-BIID does not need to lead to self-castration.\n\n\"The underlying causes might lend themselves to treatment via anti-depressants and or anti-libidinal medication in conjunction with talking therapies.\"", "source": {"uri":

Specialist Metropolitan Police detectives uncovered the horrendous crimes after a victim was first identified by Devon and Cornwall Police in November 2020. It was then found that the offending had taken place in North London.\n\nMarius Theodore Gustavson, 46, of Haringey, North London, was identified by detectives as the primary offender following a lengthy and complex investigation. Gustavson was jailed today along with six other men. He received a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 22 years. The court heard how the ringleader used the internet as a tool to seek out and manipulate vulnerable people, before coercing them to take part in the illegal procedures.\n\nA search of Gustavson's address found various items, including:\n\nBoxes of medical needles and syringes, Local anaesthetic packs, Surgical tools, A wooden chopping board and a mallet, A body board with leg and arm restraints attached, Disposable skin staplers, Numerous medical procedure videos linked to Gustavson's digital devices.\n\nAll seven men were jailed today, Thursday, May 9, for a total of 79 years after a hearing at the Old Bailey.\n\nGustavson, 46, was identified by detectives as being the primary offender Peter Wates, 67, was jailed for 12 years\n\nDetective Inspector Amanda Greig, from the Met's Specialist Crime Command, said: \"I would like to highlight the excellent work of the Met's investigation team, who have examined thousands of hours of horrific material seized from the suspects. Their diligence and professionalism have ensured no one else will suffer at the hands of these men.\n\n\"This lengthy and complex investigation demonstrates that we are determined to protect Londoners from harm and bringing those that threaten the safety of our communities to justice.\"\n\nDI Amanda Greig thanked the victims for their bravery throughout the investigation, noting their immense suffering - with many being left with profound mental health issues following the group's brutal actions. The victims were supported by specialist officers and signposted to support services by the LGBT+ anti-abuse charity GALOP.\n\nWorking with a number of UK police forces, as well as the NHS, London Ambulance Service, the General Medical Council, and the Midwifery Council - specialist detectives were able to help identify and support victims. Officers found that Gustavson owned and managed the website 'Eunuchmaker.com', which was used to advertise extreme body modification services. This included castration and penis removal.\n\nThe ringleader also filmed all the illegal mutilations and uploaded them to his production company website, capturing an international audience.\n\nDavid Carruthers, 61, was jailed for 11 years Ion Ciucur, 30, was jailed for 5 years and 8 months\n\nVictim-survivors assaulted between February 2017 and January 2020 were found to have suffered life-threatening injuries, with one victim coming close to losing his life due to blood loss. Officers sought the expertise of Consultant Urological Surgeon, Mr Chris Dawson, who said: \"The procedures performed in these cases have highlighted the dangers involved in 'back street surgery'.\n\n\"To become a highly qualified surgeon takes a number of years, and these procedures should not be carried out by anyone without the necessary experience or expertise as it risks serious complications such as significant bleeding, or sepsis. When performed in hospital, these procedures are performed under general anaesthesia in a sterile environment, with the surgeon wearing sterile gown and gloves.\n\n\"The consent process is a very important part of any surgical procedure, and surgeons are held to very high standards about this. It is imperative that patients are aware of the potential complications of any surgical procedure.\"\n\nLooking into 120 digital devices, police identified the remaining offenders by video footage and phone communication with Gustavson. Ashley Williams, David Carruthers, Peter Wates, Janus Atkins, and Ion Circuir were arrested at addresses in London, Scotland, Birmingham, and South Wales. Stefan Scharf, a German national, was arrested while in transit at Heathrow Airport.\n\nStefan Scharf, 61, was jailed for 4 years and 6 months Ashley Williams, 32, was jailed for 4 years and 6 months\n\nMost of the offences occurred at Gustavson's former home address, as well as a rented hotel room in London. The 46-year-old was jailed for a number of crimes, including:\n\nConspiring to commit grievous bodily harm Five counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent One count of making an indecent photograph of a child One count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child Possession of extreme pornographic images Distributing indecent pseudo-images of children\n\nThose also sentenced were:\n\nAshley Williams, 32, of Newport, Gwent, a Home Office employee, was jailed for 4 years and 6 months for causing GBH with intent Peter Wates, 67, of Purley, Surrey, a retired Chemist, was jailed for 12 years for conspiring to commit GBH David Carruthers, 61, of Newport, Gwent, a Home office Employee, was jailed for 11 years for conspiring to commit GBH Janus Atkin, 39, of Newport, Gwent, Unemployed, was jailed for 12 years for conspiring to commit GBH Ion Ciucur, 30, of Gretna, Scotland, a Hotel worker, was jailed for 5 years and 8 months for conspiring to commit GBH Stefan Scharf, 61, a retired German National was jailed for 4 years and 6 months for GBH with intent\n\nPolice have since urged anyone with further information to contact them on 0208 785 8267 quoting Op Vicktor. Alternatively, you can provide information anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or online at crimestoppers-uk.org.\n\nThe Met added: \"We encourage anyone who has had similar experiences to seek medical advice from their local sexual health clinic or GP. GALOP supports all LGBT+ victims and survivors of abuse: If you need advice or support, but aren't sure where to start, you can call them on 0800 999 5428.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk",

The gruesome operations were uploaded to the 26-year-old Norwegian's \"Eunuch Maker\" website where subscribers would pay to watch.\n\nHe made nearly \u00a3300,000 over four years from the site's 22,841 subscribers around the world. The eye-watering practice is linked to a subculture where men become 'nullos' - short for genital nullification - by having their penis and testicles removed, but it is not a new concept. Throughout the Chinese dynastic period, some men chose castration in order to serve as high-ranking civil servants.\n\nThe website Gustavson ran\n\nThe theory was that being unable to father children, these officials would not be tempted to seize power and start their own dynasties, according to the Big Think. In Italy too a select number of boys were rigorously trained as singers, then castrated before puberty in order to prevent changes to the voicebox to maintain a higher pitched voice.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, an international team of researchers interviewed 208 men in the Eunuch Archive online community to find out why, in modern terms they chose voluntarily to have their penis and testicles removed.\n\nA knife used to cut off Marius Gustavson's penis\n\nAccording to the Big Think: \"When asked why they elected to undergo castration, about half of respondents expressed a desire to achieve their preferred self. They weren't interested in transitioning to the female gender; they simply didn't enjoy having a penis. Some were enticed by a \"smooth genital appearance.\" Others also stated that they had no interest in sex, and thus no need for a penis.\n\n\"On the other hand, about 13% of interviewees eroticised castration, seeking it out for sexual reasons. Paradoxically, the idea of losing their genitals was a turn-on. Another 13% referenced being turned toward the procedure by a relationship partner or another castrated individual. A further 10% of respondents perceived psychological benefits from castration, liberating themselves from mind-altering hormones.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_ann_mills@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Kelly-Ann Mills", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Castration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Testicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eunuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32773712.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AHP_CHP_25847.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553015", "eventUri": "eng-9553015", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Alongside the six other men, he was jailed for life today with a minimum tariff of 22 years for:\n\nThe court heard how Gustavson used the internet to seek out and manipulate vulnerable people, coercing them to take part in the procedures.\n\nDetective Inspector Amanda Greig, from the Met's Specialist Crime Command, said: \"I would like to highlight the excellent work of the Met's investigation team, who have examined thousands of hours of horrific material seized from the suspects. Their diligence and professionalism have ensured no one else will suffer at the hands of these men.\n\n\"This lengthy and complex investigation demonstrates that we are determined to protect Londoners from harm and bring those that threaten the safety of our communities to justice.\"\n\nFollowing the court hearing today, DI Amanda Greig also thanked the victims for their bravery throughout the investigation. She acknowledged their immense suffering - with many victims having profound mental health issues as a result of the group's brutal actions. The victims were supported by specialist officers and signposted to support services by the LGBT+ anti-abuse charity GALOP.\n\nDetectives worked closely with partners from a number of UK police forces, NHS, London Ambulance Service, the General Medical Council and the Midwifery Council to help identify and support victims.\n\nThey discovered that Gustavson owned and managed the website 'Eunuchmaker.com' where he advertised extreme body modification services, including castration and penis removal. He also owned a production company, where he would record all the illegal mutilations and upload them to his site, which captured an international audience.\n\nOfficers interviewed and obtained statements from victim-survivors, who had been assaulted between February 2017 and January 2020.\n\nIn at least three cases, the injuries inflicted on the victims were life threatening, with one victim coming close to losing his life due to blood loss.\n\nOfficers sought the expertise of Consultant Urological Surgeon, Mr Chris Dawson, who stated \"The procedures performed in these cases have highlighted the dangers involved in 'back street surgery'.\n\n\"To become a highly qualified surgeon takes a number of years, and these procedures should not be carried out by anyone without the necessary experience or expertise as it risks serious complications such as significant bleeding, or sepsis. When performed in hospital, these procedures are performed under general anaesthesia in a sterile environment, with the surgeon wearing sterile gown and gloves.\n\n\"Penis removal is a complex procedure which is performed only by surgeons who have specialised in that area. Great care is needed to perform the technique in order to achieve a good cosmetic result, and to form an opening for the urethra in order to allow the man to pass urine without difficulty. If performed by an inexperienced person there would be a high likelihood of needing corrective surgery afterwards.\n\n\"The consent process is a very important part of any surgical procedure, and surgeons are held to very high standards about this. It is imperative that patients are aware of the potential complications of any surgical procedure.\"\n\nA search of Gustavson's address found various items, including boxes of medical needles and syringes, local anaesthetic packs, surgical tools, a wooden chopping board and a mallet, a body board with leg and arm restraints attached, disposable skin staplers, and numerous medical procedure videos linked to Gustavson's digital devices.\n\nAs Gustavson's pattern of offending began to unravel, detectives were able to piece together that he was not working alone.\n\nFollowing an interrogation of more than 120 digital devices the remaining offenders were identified by video footage, as well as phone communication with Gustavson. Ashley Williams, David Carruthers, Peter Wates, Janus Atkins, and Ion Circuir were arrested at addresses in London, Scotland, Birmingham and South Wales. Stefan Scharf, a German national, was arrested whilst in transit at Heathrow Airport.\n\nThe majority of the offences occurred at Gustavson's former home address, as well as a rented hotel room in London.\n\nAnyone who has further information should contact police on 0208 785 8267 quoting Op Vicktor.

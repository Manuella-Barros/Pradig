cases involving riots on May 9 last year.\n\nOn May 9, 2023, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf was accused of aiding and abetting the attacks on Shadman Police Station, Askari Tower and Jinnah House, the house of the Lahore Corps Commander.\n\nFollowing Imran Khan's arrest in May last year in connection with an alleged corruption case, his supporters launched attacks on a number of important government buildings and military installations.\n\nLahore ATC Judge Khalid Arshad denied pre-arrest bail to Imran Khan and dismissed his pleas in all three cases after the prosecution

Wednesday.\n\nDue to the absence of Mr Khan's legal team, the judge ruled that the court would make a short order and issue a detailed order later.\n\nReacting sharply to the court's decision, Imran

spokesperson Raoof Hasan said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHe said that the subjugation of the judiciary to the personal agenda of the oppressive, undemocratic and unconstitutional forces is the biggest catalyst for the \"painful death of law and justice and a major obstacle to justice in Pakistan.\"\n\n\"The state of Pakistan is under the grip of the worst personal dictatorship and law of the jungle and the sole purpose of rejecting Imran Khan's bail pleas was to prolong his illegal incarceration after his acquittal in all other false, fabricated and politically motivated cases,\" he said.\n\nHe said that despite the propaganda of the past year, no evidence has been presented in any court regarding the allegations against Imran Khan.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car

Justice Arshad announced the brief order at 7 pm, which he reserved on July 6 after hearing final arguments from the prosecution and the petitioners' counsel, Dawn newspaper reported on Wednesday. Due to the absence of Khan's legal team, the judge ruled that the court would announce a brief order and issue a detailed order later. Reacting sharply to the court's decision, Khan's party on Wednesday said it was a ploy to keep the former prime minister in jail. \"Rejection of pre-arrest bail pleas is a ploy to keep Imran Khan in jail for a longer period,\" PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said in a statement on Wednesday. He said surrender of the judiciary to the personal agenda of oppressive, undemocratic and unconstitutional forces is the biggest catalyst for the painful death of law and justice and a major obstacle to justice in Pakistan. \"The state of Pakistan is in the grip of the worst personal dictatorship and law of the jungle and the sole purpose of rejecting Imran Khan's bail pleas was to prolong his illegal incarceration after his acquittal in all other false, fabricated and politically motivated cases,\" he said. He said that despite the propaganda of the past year, no evidence has been presented in any court regarding the allegations against Khan.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV_Corps_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IV Corps (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti_Terrorism_Court_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti Terrorism Court of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Jail_Rawalpindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Jail Rawalpindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.theweek.in/etc/designs/week/img/logo-main.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719327", "eventUri": "eng-9719327", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-09", "textStart": 151, "textEnd": 156, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 1178, "textEnd": 1184}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The presence of the incarcerated PTI founder chairman could not be noted through video link due to poor internet service in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, the report said. Rejecting allegations of conspiracy and incitement, lawyer Salman Safdar argued that there were no witnesses to prove that Khan had incited violence and wondered how he could have conspired given his detention on May 9 and release on May 11. He mentioned that Khan condemned the protests and urged his supporters to refrain from violence after his release. Special Public Prosecutor Rana Abdul Jabbar said that a video of Khan was circulated on social media before he left for the Islamabad court in which he claimed to be fighting for haqeeqi azadi (true freedom), Dawn newspaper reported. The prosecutor argued that in mob crimes, every individual in the crowd is treated as an accomplice, including those who guide from a distance via modern communication tools.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV_Corps_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IV Corps (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti_Terrorism_Court_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti Terrorism Court of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Jail_Rawalpindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Jail Rawalpindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.theweek.in/etc/designs/week/img/logo-main.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719327", "eventUri": "eng-9719327", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-09", "textStart": 150, "textEnd": 155, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 1169, "textEnd": 1175}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-11", "textStart": 1859, "textEnd": 1865}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Khan had condemned the protests and urged his supporters to refrain from violence after his release, he said.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV_Corps_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IV Corps (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti_Terrorism_Court_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti Terrorism Court of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.theweek.in/etc/designs/week/img/logo-main.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719327", "eventUri": "eng-9719327", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 13}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-09", "textStart": 126, "textEnd": 131, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

ExBulletin", "body": "71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician faces over 200 cases (File)\n\nLahore:\n\nA Pakistani anti-terrorism court has rejected pre-arrest bail pleas for former prime minister Imran Khan jailed in three cases of May 9 riots, prompting his party to dismiss the decision as a ploy to prolong his detention.\n\nThe founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has been charged with inciting attacks on the Lahore Corps Commander's house, known as Jinnah House, Askari Tower and Shadman Police Station on May 9, 2023.\n\nMr Khan's supporters attacked several key government buildings and military installations after his arrest in an alleged corruption case in May last year.\n\nLahore ATC Judge Khalid Arshad denied Mr Khan pre-arrest bail and dismissed his pleas in all three cases, after the prosecution likened the May 9 violence to the attacks on the US Capitol by supporters of former US President Donald Trump in 2021.\n\nThe prosecution said police had requested the former prime minister's detention to complete the investigation into the three cases.\n\nThe 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician is facing over 200 cases and has been in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail since August last year.\n\nJustice Arshad announced the brief order at 7 pm, which he reserved on July 6 after hearing final arguments from the prosecution and the petitioner's counsel, Dawn newspaper reported on Wednesday.\n\nDue to the absence of Mr Khan's legal team, the judge ruled that the court would make a short order and issue a detailed order later.\n\nReacting sharply to the court's decision, Mr Khan's party said on Wednesday that it was a ploy to keep the former prime minister in jail.\n\n\"Rejection of pre-arrest bail pleas is a ploy to keep Imran Khan in jail for a longer period,\" PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHe said that the subjugation of the judiciary to the personal agenda of the oppressive, undemocratic and unconstitutional forces is the biggest catalyst for the \"painful death of law and justice and a major obstacle to justice in Pakistan.\"\n\n\"The state of Pakistan is under the grip of the worst personal dictatorship and law of the jungle and the sole purpose of rejecting Imran Khan's bail pleas was to prolong his illegal incarceration after his acquittal in all other false, fabricated and politically motivated cases,\" he said.\n\nHe said that despite the propaganda over the past year, no evidence has been presented in any court regarding the allegations against Mr Khan.\n\n(Except for the headline, this

The court determined that he had given party leaders the assignment to target government buildings, military installations, and law enforcement personnel in an effort to put pressure on them to secure his release.\n\nThe 71-year-old PTI founder and hundreds of his party associates are on trial in many counts, one of which is related to the violent protests by his supporters on May 9, 2023, which resulted in damage to important military installations throughout Pakistan. The case is being tried under the Official Secrets Act. On May 9, 2018, Pakistan saw historic demonstrations following Mr. Khan's detention in connection with a purported corruption investigation.\n\nImran Khan's party workers allegedly vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi too was attacked by the mob for the first time.\n\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party termed the anti-terrorism court's ruling an \"absurd order\" and declared that it would launch a protest.\n\nThe anti-terrorism court (ATC) at Lahore had earlier this week dismissed pre-arrest bail to Mr Khan in three cases related to the May 9 riots and allowed police his continued custody for interrogation.\n\nIn a detailed order issued here on Thursday, ATC Judge Khalid Arshad said: \"An extraordinary concession of pre-arrest bail is meant for an innocent person and not the petitioner, Imran Khan Niazi, who hatched, materialised alleged criminal conspiracy along with the senior PTI leadership and protesters/accused having a common object to wage a war against the state to topple over the government.\" The order said that Mr Khan not only incited people but also instructed leaders to create chaos, disturb law and order, and commit arson to pressure the military and government for his release. This was disclosed in statements from two prosecution witnesses, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.\n\n\"The pre-arrest bail of the petitioner has no merits and is hereby dismissed while withdrawing his already granted interim bail,\" the judge said.\n\nThe judge further observed: A peaceful demonstrator becomes a \"terrorist\" when he hatches a criminal conspiracy, disseminates it and shares a common object with other accused, who, being armed, attack and attempt to damage state properties like Lahore Corps Commander House known as Jinnah House at Lahore, targeting government machinery &mldr; He loses his normal right to be a law-abiding citizen.\"\n\nThe order, quoting the special public prosecutor, said that a criminal conspiracy was hatched at Imran Khan's Lahore Zaman Park residence on May 7 and 8 in which Mr Khan himself told the top PTI leadership regarding his apprehension of arrest and the reaction of launching protests and damage of military installations.\n\nReacting to the detailed ACT order, the PTI said, \"The judgment contains no evidence of Imran Khan ordering May 9 violence. The judge while dismissing pre-arrest bails of Mr Khan is drawing inferences and assumptions.\" The PTI pointed out in its statement, how previously the Supreme Court of Pakistan had termed the arrest of Imran Khan, illegal and added: \"We will challenge the verdict of the Anti-Terrorism Court.\" The anti-terrorist courts in other parts of the country, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha etc have dismissed the case accusing Imran Khan of being the main accused of instigating the May 9 violent incidents, based on the fact that there is no evidence provided establishing the prosecution's point,\" the PTI said.\n\nThe party also claimed that since Mr Khan is in prison only in the Iddat case, \"which is evidently coming to a conclusion\" on the likely dismissal of rubbish claims by the complainant, it seems this is yet another politically motivated case to prolong the illegal incarceration of Mr Khan.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the party's Parliamentary Committee decided that it would raise its voice for Mr Khan and all the innocent prisoners at protests or rallies, starting the movement immediately.\n\n\"Parliamentary Leader Ms Zartaj Gul Wazir @zartajgulwazir presided over the discussion regarding the decisions made in the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee,\" the PTI said in a post on its official X handle.\n\nPTI core committee member Advocate Abuzar Salman Niazi said on X: \"Absurd Order. Judge has declared Imran Khan is not innocent. Note: trial is still going on and no conviction is on record in this case. How can Imran Khan be declared guilty before completion of Trial.

dismissed pre-arrest bail petitions of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in three cases of riots on May 9 last year, prompting his party to reject the ruling as a ploy to prolong his detention.\n\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder was booked on the charges of abetment in attacks on Lahore Corps Commander House known as Jinnah House, Askari Tower, and Shadman police station on May 9, 2023.\n\nAlso Read | Indian Dies in Dubai: Manjot Singh From Punjab's Ludhiana Answers Pakistani Roommate's Call for Help, Gets Killed in Fight.\n\nSupporters of Khan attacked several important government buildings and army installations following his arrest in an alleged corruption case in May last year.\n\nATC Lahore Judge Khalid Arshad refused pre-arrest bail to Khan and dismissed his petitions in the three cases, after the prosecution equated the May 9 violence to the United States Capitol Hill attacks by supporters of former US president Donald Trump in 2021.\n\nAlso Read | Baba Vanga Predictions for 2025: 'End of the World' Will Start Next Year, Blind Mystic Aka Balkan Nostradamus' Timeline for Doomsday Goes Viral.\n\nThe prosecution said the police required custody of the former premier to complete the investigation in the three cases.\n\nThe 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician is facing over 200 cases and has been in Rawalpindi's Adiala jail since August last year.\n\nJudge Arshad announced the short order at 7 pm, which he reserved on July 6 after hearing the final arguments of the prosecution and the petitioner's counsel, the Dawn newspaper reported on Wednesday.\n\nDue to the absence of Khan's legal team, the judge decided that the court would announce a short order and come out with a detailed order later.\n\nReacting sharply to the court's ruling, Khan's party on Wednesday said it was a ploy to keep the former prime minister in jail.\n\n\"Rejection of pre-arrest bail pleas is a ploy to keep Imran Khan in jail for a longer period,\" PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHe said the judiciary's surrender to the oppressive, anti-democratic and anti-constitutional forces' personal agenda is the biggest catalyst for the \"painful death of law and justice and a major obstacle to justice in Pakistan\".\n\n\"The state of Pakistan is under the grip of the worst personal dictatorship and the law of the jungle and the sole purpose to dismiss Imran Khan's bail pleas was to prolong his unlawful incarceration after his acquittal in all others false, fabricated and politically motivated cases,\" he said.\n\nHe said that despite propaganda for the past year, no evidence has been presented in any court regarding the allegations made against Khan.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType":

Before announcing the verdict at 7 p.m., the judge asked about Imran Khan's lawyers as the prosecution team was present in court.\n\nThe judge was informed that the petitioners' lead counsel, Mr Salman Safdar, was in Islamabad and his associate had also left the court earlier.\n\nThe judge asked the prosecution to contact the applicant's legal team and ruled that the court would issue a prompt order due to the absence of the other party. The judge said the detailed verdict would be delivered on Wednesday (today).\n\nATC judge approves bail for Omar Ayub, Fawad, Imran's sisters till July 19\n\nThe judge announced the decision to dismiss Imran Khan's pleas seeking interim bail before his arrest in the Jinnah House, Askari Tower and Shadman police station attack cases.\n\nIn closing arguments, the prosecution compared the May 9 protests to the U.S. Capitol riots, saying police needed the former prime minister's custody to complete the investigation into all three cases.\n\nThe presence of the imprisoned PTI founder chairman could not be noted through video link due to poor internet service in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi. However, the prosecutor on behalf of the jail authorities confirmed to the court that Imran Khan was imprisoned in Rawalpindi Jail.\n\nDismissing the allegations of conspiracy and incitement, lawyer Salman Safdar argued that there were no witnesses to prove that Mr Khan had incited violence and questioned how he could have conspired given his detention on May 9 and release on May 11.\n\nHe said Mr Khan condemned the protests and urged his supporters to refrain from violence after his release.\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Rana Abdul Jabbar said that a video of Imran Khan was circulated on social media before he left for the Islamabad court, in which Mr Khan claimed to be fighting for haqeeqi azadi (true freedom). The prosecutor argued that in mob crimes, every individual in the crowd is treated as an accomplice, including those who guide from a distance through modern communication tools.\n\nOn March 1, another ATC confirmed Imran Khan's pre-arrest bail in four criminal cases, including the murder of party worker Zille Shah, the attack on police outside Zaman Park and the burning of PML-N offices in Model Town and a container in Kalma Chowk on May 9, 2023.\n\nOmar and Fawad released on bail\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside an ATC in the provincial capital, Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub slammed the coalition government, saying the decision to allow the spy agency to spy on citizens would prove suicidal for the Form-47 government and would haunt the incumbent leadership in future.\n\nHe said that the government had committed an act of economic terrorism by presenting an anti-poor budget fearing that the electricity tariff would exceed Rs 100 per unit. The opposition leader pointed out that the government was going to privatise public institutions for Rs 30 billion, while the value of these institutions is Rs 1,000 billion. He raised the issue of transparency in the privatisation process of Pakistan International Airline.\n\nBesides the PTI MNA, former PTI leaders Fawad Chaudhry, Asad Umar and Imran Khan's two sisters appeared before the anti-terrorism court after their pre-arrest bail expired in several cases related to the May 9 violence.\n\nJudge Khalid Arshad extended their bail till July 19 and directed DIG Investigation Zeeshan Asghar to ensure completion of the investigation without further delay.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, former PTI chief Fawad Chaudhry urged JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai to form a grand opposition alliance in which PTI would also join. The former minister said the integrity and independence of police, FIA and prosecution had been destroyed in the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 10, 2024\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

The unprecedented protests erupted across Pakistan on May 9 last year after Khan was arrested in an alleged corruption case.\n\nKhan's party workers allegedly vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi too was attacked by the mob for the first time.\n\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party termed the anti-terrorism court's ruling an \"absurd order\" and declared that it would launch a protest.\n\nThe anti-terrorism court (ATC) at Lahore had earlier this week dismissed pre-arrest bail to Khan in three cases related to the May 9 riots and allowed police his continued custody for interrogation.\n\nIn a detailed order issued here on Thursday, ATC Judge Khalid Arshad said: \"An extraordinary concession of pre-arrest bail is meant for an innocent person and not the petitioner, Imran Khan Niazi, who hatched, materialised alleged criminal conspiracy along with the senior PTI leadership and protesters/accused having a common object to wage a war against the state to topple over the government.\" The order said that Khan not only incited people but also instructed leaders to create chaos, disturb law and order, and commit arson to pressure the military and government for his release. This was disclosed in statements from two prosecution witnesses, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.\n\n\"The pre-arrest bail of the petitioner has no merits and is hereby dismissed while withdrawing his already granted interim bail,\" the judge said.\n\nReacting to the detailed ACT order, the PTI said, \"The judgment contains no evidence of Imran Khan ordering May 9 violence. The judge while dismissing pre-arrest bails of Khan is drawing inferences and assumptions.\" The PTI pointed out in its statement, how previously the Supreme Court of Pakistan had termed the arrest of Imran Khan, illegal and added: \"We will challenge the verdict of the Anti-Terrorism Court.\" The anti-terrorist courts in other parts of the country, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha etc have dismissed the case accusing Imran Khan of being the main accused of instigating the May 9 violent incidents, based on the fact that there is no evidence provided establishing the prosecution's point,\" the PTI said.\n\nThe party also claimed that since Khan is in prison only in the Iddat case, \"which is evidently coming to a conclusion\" on the likely dismissal of rubbish claims by the complainant, it seems this is yet another politically motivated case to prolong the illegal incarceration of Khan.\" Meanwhile, the party's Parliamentary Committee decided that it would raise its voice for Khan and all the innocent prisoners at protests or rallies, starting the movement immediately.\n\n\"Parliamentary Leader Ms Zartaj Gul Wazir @zartajgulwazir presided over the discussion regarding the decisions made in the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee,\" the PTI said in a post on its official X handle.\n\nPTI core committee member Advocate Abuzar Salman Niazi said on X: \"Absurd Order. Judge has declared Imran Khan is not innocent. Note: trial is still going on and no conviction is on record in this case. How can Imran Khan be declared guilty before completion of Trial. Where will principle of law (everyone is innocent until proven guilty).

This was disclosed in statements from two prosecution witnesses.\n\nDespite objections from Imran Khan's counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, regarding the credibility of the accusations, the detailed order stated that two witnesses had testified under section 161 Cr.P.C.\n\nThey reported that Imran Khan had a meeting on May 7, 2023, where he instructed PTI leaders to prepare for his potential arrest on May 9, 2023, in Islamabad. Upon his arrest, they were to mobilize PTI workers to attack military installations, government properties, and police officials to compel the government and armed forces to release him.\n\nMoreover, on May 9, 2023, before leaving for Islamabad, Imran Khan sent a video message warning that the country's situation would deteriorate like Sri Lanka if he were arrested. The order also noted that Imran Khan's statements were widely disseminated via PTI's official Twitter account, urging PTI workers to protest, labelling it as a \"real jihad for real freedom.\"\n\nFurthermore, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur had announced that if Imran Khan initiates a hunger strike, similar protests will erupt across Pakistan and globally.\n\nAddressing the concerns of the PTI founder, he said, \"His reservations are completely valid. If he goes on a hunger strike, the protest will spread throughout Pakistan and around the world. We adhere to the law and respect it, and we can engage in peaceful protests to claim our rights.\"\n\nRead Imran Khan acquitted in another case\n\nThe prosecution's case against Imran Khan is that he

The unprecedented protests erupted across Pakistan on May 9 last year after Khan was arrested in an alleged corruption case.\n\nAlso Read | PwC China Layoffs: UK-Based Fintech Consulting Firm Lays Off 100 Employees From Various Departments After Losing 30 Major Clients in Country.\n\nKhan's party workers allegedly vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi too was attacked by the mob for the first time.\n\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party termed the anti-terrorism court's ruling an \"absurd order\" and declared that it would launch a protest.\n\nAlso Read | European Union Accepts Apple's Offer To Open Up Contactless Payments, Ends Long-Running Competition Investigation.\n\nThe anti-terrorism court (ATC) at Lahore had earlier this week dismissed pre-arrest bail to Khan in three cases related to the May 9 riots and allowed police his continued custody for interrogation.\n\nIn a detailed order issued here on Thursday, ATC Judge Khalid Arshad said: \"An extraordinary concession of pre-arrest bail is meant for an innocent person and not the petitioner, Imran Khan Niazi, who hatched, materialised alleged criminal conspiracy along with the senior PTI leadership and protesters/accused having a common object to wage a war against the state to topple over the government.\"\n\nThe order said that Khan not only incited people but also instructed leaders to create chaos, disturb law and order, and commit arson to pressure the military and government for his release. This was disclosed in statements from two prosecution witnesses, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.\n\n\"The pre-arrest bail of the petitioner has no merits and is hereby dismissed while withdrawing his already granted interim bail,\" the judge said.\n\nThe judge further observed: A peaceful demonstrator becomes a \"terrorist\" when he hatches a criminal conspiracy, disseminates it and shares a common object with other accused, who, being armed, attack and attempt to damage state properties like Lahore Corps Commander House known as Jinnah House at Lahore, targeting government machinery ... He loses his normal right to be a law-abiding citizen.\"\n\nThe order, quoting the special public prosecutor, said that a criminal conspiracy was hatched at Khan's Lahore Zaman Park residence on May 7 and 8 in which Khan himself told the top PTI leadership regarding his apprehension of arrest and the reaction of launching protests and damage of military installations.\n\nReacting to the detailed ACT order, the PTI said, \"The judgment contains no evidence of Imran Khan ordering May 9 violence. The judge while dismissing pre-arrest bails of Khan is drawing inferences and assumptions.\"\n\nThe PTI pointed out in its statement, how previously the Supreme Court of Pakistan had termed the arrest of Imran Khan, illegal and added: \"We will challenge the verdict of the Anti-Terrorism Court.\"\n\nThe anti-terrorist courts in other parts of the country, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha etc have dismissed the case accusing Imran Khan of being the main accused of instigating the May 9 violent incidents, based on the fact that there is no evidence provided establishing the prosecution's point,\" the PTI said.\n\nThe party also claimed that since Khan is in prison only in the Iddat case, \"which is evidently coming to a conclusion\" on the likely dismissal of rubbish claims by the complainant, it seems this is yet another politically motivated case to prolong the illegal incarceration of Khan.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the party's Parliamentary Committee decided that it would raise its voice for Khan and all the innocent prisoners at protests or rallies, starting the movement immediately.\n\n\"Parliamentary Leader Ms Zartaj Gul Wazir @zartajgulwazir presided over the discussion regarding the decisions made in the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee,\" the PTI said in a post on its official X handle.\n\nPTI core committee member Advocate Abuzar Salman Niazi said on X: \"Absurd Order.

The unprecedented protests erupted across Pakistan on May 9 last year after Khan was arrested in an alleged corruption case.\n\nKhan's party workers allegedly vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi too was attacked by the mob for the first time.\n\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party termed the anti-terrorism court's ruling an \"absurd order\" and declared that it would launch a protest.\n\nThe anti-terrorism court (ATC) at Lahore had earlier this week dismissed pre-arrest bail to Khan in three cases related to the May 9 riots and allowed police his continued custody for interrogation.\n\nIn a detailed order issued here on Thursday, ATC Judge Khalid Arshad said: \"An extraordinary concession of pre-arrest bail is meant for an innocent person and not the petitioner, Imran Khan Niazi, who hatched, materialised alleged criminal conspiracy along with the senior PTI leadership and protesters/accused having a common object to wage a war against the state to topple over the government.\" The order said that Khan not only incited people but also instructed leaders to create chaos, disturb law and order, and commit arson to pressure the military and government for his release. This was disclosed in statements from two prosecution witnesses, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.\n\n\"The pre-arrest bail of the petitioner has no merits and is hereby dismissed while withdrawing his already granted interim bail,\" the judge said.\n\nThe judge further observed: A peaceful demonstrator becomes a \"terrorist\" when he hatches a criminal conspiracy, disseminates it and shares a common object with other accused, who, being armed, attack and attempt to damage state properties like Lahore Corps Commander House known as Jinnah House at Lahore, targeting government machinery ... He loses his normal right to be a law-abiding citizen.\" The order, quoting the special public prosecutor, said that a criminal conspiracy was hatched at Khan's Lahore Zaman Park residence on May 7 and 8 in which Khan himself told the top PTI leadership regarding his apprehension of arrest and the reaction of launching protests and damage of military installations.\n\nReacting to the detailed ACT order, the PTI said, \"The judgment contains no evidence of Imran Khan ordering May 9 violence. The judge while dismissing pre-arrest bails of Khan is drawing inferences and assumptions.\" The PTI pointed out in its statement, how previously the Supreme Court of Pakistan had termed the arrest of Imran Khan, illegal and added: \"We will challenge the verdict of the Anti-Terrorism Court.\" The anti-terrorist courts in other parts of the country, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha etc have dismissed the case accusing Imran Khan of being the main accused of instigating the May 9 violent incidents, based on the fact that there is no evidence provided establishing the prosecution's point,\" the PTI said.\n\nThe party also claimed that since Khan is in prison only in the Iddat case, \"which is evidently coming to a conclusion\" on the likely dismissal of rubbish claims by the complainant, it seems this is yet another politically motivated case to prolong the illegal incarceration of Khan.\" Meanwhile, the party's Parliamentary Committee decided that it would raise its voice for Khan and all the innocent prisoners at protests or rallies, starting the movement immediately.\n\n\"Parliamentary Leader Ms Zartaj Gul Wazir @zartajgulwazir presided over the discussion regarding the decisions made in the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee,\" the PTI said in a post on its official X handle.\n\nPTI core committee member Advocate Abuzar Salman Niazi said on X: \"Absurd Order. Judge has declared Imran Khan is not innocent. Note: trial is still going on and no conviction is on record in this case. How can Imran Khan be declared guilty before completion of Trial. Where will principle of law (everyone is innocent until proven guilty).

At one point, the law officer said Imran had likened himself to the Quad-e-Azam and Allama Iqbal.\n\nIn response, Safdar argued that the law officer had taken the matters personally rather than debating on legal aspects.\n\nThe ATC judge asked whether someone's claim about what they wrote online could be considered as a statement whether or not they were present at the scene.\n\nThe law officer replied in the affirmative.\n\nThe judge then asked if the report of the Special Branch wss acceptable in the court.\n\nThe law officer replied that the person who prepared the report would appear before the court as a witness.\n\nAfter hearing detailed arguments from both the sides, the ATC judge reserved the decision.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Pakistan - ExBulletin", "body": "LAHORE: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Tuesday rejected pre-arrest bail pleas of former PTI chairman Imran Khan in three cases including the attack on the Corps Commander's house.\n\nThe court delivered its verdict on July 6.\n\nBefore announcing its verdict around 7 pm, the court questioned Imran Khan's lawyers who were not present in the court.\n\nThe court was informed that the lead counsel for the applicants was in Islamabad and his associate had left the court earlier.\n\nThe court therefore decided to announce a short-term order due to the absence of the other party.\n\nThe court said the detailed verdict will be delivered on Wednesday (today).\n\nIn closing arguments, the prosecution had compared the May 9 protests to the attacks on the US Capitol and said the police needed Imran Khan's custody to complete the investigation.\n\nImran's presence could not be noted through video link due to poor internet service in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.\n\nDismissing the allegations of conspiracy and incitement, Imran's lead counsel had argued that there was no witness to prove that Imran Khan had incited the violence.\n\nThe special prosecutor, however, said that before Imran left for the Islamabad court, a video was posted on social media in which Khan claimed to be fighting for hageeqi azadi (true freedom).\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti_Terrorism_Court_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti Terrorism Court of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Jail_Rawalpindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Jail Rawalpindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Recorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Recorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719327", "eventUri": "eng-9719327", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 218, "textEnd": 224}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-09", "textStart": 707, "textEnd": 712}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

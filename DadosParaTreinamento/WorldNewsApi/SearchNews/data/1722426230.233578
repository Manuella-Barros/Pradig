{"id": 243311504, "title": "Yankees' struggling rotation was main culprit during ugly rough patch", "text": "TORONTO \u2014 Give the Yankees this: as their hot start turned cold over the past two weeks, almost all of them have had a hand in it. Aside from Aaron Judge, the lineup has entered a collective slump, some worse than others. The bullpen has been in disarray. A few key injuries have hurt both the lineup and pitching staff. But there might not be a more critical element of their skid than the rotation\u2019s sudden spiral. The Yankees \u2014 who snapped their four-game skid with a 16-5 blowout win over the Blue Jays on Friday night \u2014 woke up on June 15 with the lowest starters\u2019 ERA in the majors at 2.77 across 72 games, all of which they had done without Gerrit Cole. And the reigning AL Cy Young winner\u2019s return was just days away, a scary thought for opponents as the rotation was primed to get even better. Instead, the following 11 games before Friday\u2019s win were one big collective struggle, during which Yankees starters combined to post an 8.65 ERA \u2014 the highest in the majors during that stretch. The Yankees were outscored 86-43 overall in those 11 games while going 2-9. Some of it could be chalked up to the ebb and flow of the season, but manager Aaron Boone admitted that was only part of it. \u201cThere\u2019s also a few of us that have gotten popped in the mouth, too,\u201d Boone said Friday at Rogers Centre. \u201cYou got to dig in and where there are little improvements and adjustments to be made, [make them].\u201d Nestor Cortes and Marcus Stroman, who allowed three runs in 4 \u00b9/\u2083 innings in Friday\u2019s win, have mostly been solid during this stretch. But Carlos Rodon has turned in three straight clunkers, Luis Gil two and Gerrit Cole has had some bumps in two starts while still building his workload back up. \u201cSo these are all things that are fixable and in every case, capable of getting guys on track,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe just got to make those little subtle adjustments and then go out there and execute at a high level. There\u2019s no reason why we don\u2019t flip that script right away.\u201d Through the first two-plus months of the season, starters had given the Yankees a chance to win almost every game. That has hardly been the case of late, with the Yankees often facing a big deficit early. \u201dIt\u2019s not easy for the offense when they\u2019re down 5-0 after the first and then after the second they\u2019re down 8-0,\u201d Rodon said Thursday night after putting them in those early holes. \u201cIt makes it hard for them to claw back.\u201d Among the other potential areas of concern that have popped up recently: A slumping lineup: In this 11-game stretch, the Yankees hit .197 with a .645 OPS. If you subtract the red-hot Judge from that, it is a .182 average and .580 OPS. Though Gleyber Torres and DJ LeMahieu have been scuffling for most of the season, Alex Verdugo entered Friday 4-for-38 during this 11-game stretch while Anthony Volpe has cooled off, batting .200 with a .493 OPS over his last 20 games. Boone was not concerned about either, calling Verdugo \u201cthe last one I\u2019m worried about.\u201d Injuries: Besides the slumps, the middle of the order has taken a hit with Giancarlo Stanton (hamstring strain) and Anthony Rizzo (arm fracture) going down during this stretch. Stanton could be back by late next month while Rizzo is expected to be sidelined until August. Bullpen woes: The relief corps had been one of the majors\u2019 best in the early going, but they have largely struggled for more than a month now. The Yankees have shuffled up their relievers while trying to find the right group to help them, though they are still expected to address the bullpen at the trade deadline, with it being their biggest area of concern.", "summary": "Give the Yankees this: as their hot start turned cold over the past two weeks, almost all of them have had a hand in it.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/sports/yankees-rotation-was-main-culprit-during-rough-patch/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-xkovo4rlj-1719632292718.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719617963&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:34:14", "author": "Greg Joyce", "authors": ["Greg Joyce"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.475}

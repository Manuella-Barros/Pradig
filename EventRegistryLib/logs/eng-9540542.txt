It also said it was investigating whether another four deaths were related to the storms.\n\nFlooding from storms in the past few days has affected more than two thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state, which borders Uruguay and Argentina, leaving more than 115,000 people displaced, according to authorities. Floods have destroyed roads and bridges in several cities. The rains also triggered landslides and the partial collapse of a dam at a small hydroelectric power plant.\n\nMore than 400,000 people were without power on Sunday evening, while nearly a third of the state's population was without water, authorities said. In Porto Alegre, the Guaiba lake breached its banks, hitting the highest water level on record, according to the national geological service. Porto Alegre's international airport has suspended all flights since Friday.\n\nAt a makeshift rescue center in Porto Alegre, Kaeli Moraes described being rescued along with her husband and their three children when the water had nearly reached the second floor of their house. \"There was flooding in September, then in November, and now this one. It is only getting worse,\" Moraes said.\n\nIn the city of Canoas, near Porto Alegre, Julio Manichesque, 76, was rescued by volunteers after he had stayed since Friday on the roof of the house where he has lived for 52 years. \"I have never seen that much water,\" Manichesque said.\n\nDuring his weekly address to crowds in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, Pope Francis said on Sunday he was praying for the people of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu\u00eds_Fabiano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lu\u00eds Fabiano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter's_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Peter's Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_29_28_0264767.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The storm also triggered landslides and the partial collapse of a dam at a small hydroelectric power plant. A second dam in the city of Bento Goncalves is also at risk of collapsing, authorities said.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, the Guaiba lake broke its banks, flooding streets.\n\nPorto Alegre's international airport has suspended all flights for an indefinite period.\n\nState Governor Eduardo Leite told reporters on Saturday evening that Rio Grande do Sul would need a \"Marshall Plan\" to recover.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who had visited Rio Grande do Sul on Thursday, will travel back to the state on Sunday to follow the rescue efforts, his chief of communication Paulo Pimenta said on Saturday.\n\nLula said on X that his government is in constant contact with state and cities' authorities to support the region with whatever they need.\n\nRains are expected in the northern and northeastern regions of the state until Sunday, but the volume of precipitation has been declining, and should be well below the peak seen earlier in the week, according to the state meteorology authority.\n\nStill, \"rivers water levels should stay high for some days\", Leite said earlier on Saturday.\n\nRio Grande do Sul is at a geographical meeting point between tropical and polar atmospheres, which has created a weather pattern with periods of intense rains and others of drought.\n\nLocal scientists believe the pattern has been intensifying due to climate change.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "en.ammonnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0645\u0648\u0646

However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute.

Let's reduce the damage so we can be together to rebuild.\"\n\nDamage from the rains has already forced more than 150,000 people from their homes. An additional 50,000 have taken refuge in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters.\n\nBrazil\u00b4s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday, accompanied by Defense Minister Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva, among others.\n\nDuring Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the state\u00b4s population.\n\nPublic health experts say there is growing risk of disease as much of the region remains underwater, warning that cases of dengue fever and leptospirosis in particular could rise sharply within days\n\nSecurity is another concern. Rio Grande do Sul\u00b4s public security secretariat said in a statement that police will beef up operations to prevent looting and theft. Several volunteers working on rescue operations have been robbed as they tried to help in the Porto Alegre metropolitan region.\n\nAlso on Monday, three top-tier Rio Grande do Sul state soccer clubs whose stadiums are flooded urged Brazil\u00b4s soccer federation to suspend their national league matches for the next 20 days because of the flooding.

The capital, Porto Alegre, has been virtually cut off, with the airport and bus station closed and main roads blocked because of the floodwaters.\n\nThe floods in Brazil are among extreme weather events being seen around the world.\n\nYoga teacher Maria Vit\u00f3ria Jorge's apartment building in downtown Porto Alegre is flooded, so she's leaving it behind, having withdrawn about 8,000 reais ($1,600) from her savings to rent an apartment for herself and her parents elsewhere in the state.\n\n\"I can't shower at home, wash the dishes or even have drinkable water,\" the 35-year-old Jorge said in her car as she prepared to travel. She had just a gallon of water for the 200-kilometer (125-mile) drive to the city of Torres, so far unaffected by the floods.\n\nFive of the Porto Alegre's six water treatment facilities aren't working, and Porto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo on Monday decreed that water be used exclusively for \"essential consumption.\"\n\n\"We are living an unprecedented natural disaster and everyone needs to help,\" Melo told journalists. \"I am getting water trucks to soccer fields and people will have to go there to get their water in bottles. I cannot get them to go home to home.\"\n\nThe most urgent need is drinking water, but food and personal hygiene products are also in short supply. Other Brazilian states are mobilizing trucks with donations bound for Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThere were long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets in Porto Alegre on Tuesday. Some people have tried to buy bottled water since the weekend, and when they could find it, their purchases were limited to two five-liter (1.3-gallon) bottles.\n\nPublic health experts say there is also growing risk of disease as much of the region remains submerged, warning that cases of dengue fever and leptospirosis, a bacterial disease, in particular could rise sharply within days.\n\nAdriano Hueck on Tuesday was attempting to retrieve medicine stocked at a friend's warehouse, which is partially flooded.\n\n\"If we can save some of it, there's still a chance it can be useful in hospitals,\" said 53-year-old Hueck, who then pointed toward another part of the city. \"My house is somewhere there. You can't even see its roof now.\"\n\nLike Jorge, the yoga teacher, residents in Rio Grande do Sul who are able to flee are doing so, amid fears of shortage and disease. However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nClose to the airport, about 100 people of a nearby slum set up tents on the road, hoping to return to their shacks on small boats to try to save some of their belongings. Some roasted chunks of meat on improvised grills.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall could exceed 150 millimeters (nearly six inches) by early Wednesday.\n\nLate Monday, Rio Grande do Sul Gov. Eduardo Leite issued an alert for several cities close to the huge Patos Lagoon. The floodwaters in Porto Alegre and other cities pass through the lagoon to the sea.\n\n\"The water level will rise and it will affect you,\" he said in a video broadcast on his social media channels. \"Please, believe the alerts and help us save lives. Let's reduce the damage so we can be together to rebuild.\"\n\nPorto Alegre's metropolitan region is one of Brazil's largest, home to around 4 million people.\n\nDamage from the rains has already forced more than 150,000 people from their homes. An additional 50,000 have taken refuge in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday, accompanied by Defense Minister Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva, among others.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that they are concerned about the risks of hypothermia, as the temperature should drop to 10 C (50 F) on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Melo issued a plea for more donations of blankets.\n\nAnd it isn't just residents who are at risk.\n\n\"Our personnel has been wet for five days, shivering in the cold, staying up all night, in deficient sanitary conditions, because we're sharing the same facilities with the displaced,\" Gen. Hertz Pires do Nascimento, the army commander of Brazil's southern region, told journalists.\n\nDuring Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the state's population.\n\nSecurity is another concern. Rio Grande do Sul's public security secretariat said in a statement that police will beef up operations to prevent looting and theft. Brazil's national guard is mobilizing to the state to reinforce security.\n\n\"Even a boat was stolen this morning from the people working on the rescue. Jet Skis and houses were looted. This is deplorable and must be denounced,\" Paulo Pimenta, Lula's spokesperson, said Tuesday at a news conference.\n\nThe flood disaster is also likely to affect the South American country's food supplies. Rio Grande do Sul produces 70% of an basic Brazilian foodstuff: rice.\n\n\"With the rains, I think we've definitely delayed the harvest in Rio Grande do Sul.

Civil defense figures showed that 417 of Rio Grande do Sul's 497 towns have been affected by the heavy rains.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aquifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras\u00edlia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bras\u00edlia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bras\u00edlia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tang_Soo_Do_and_Soo_Bahk_Do", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tang Soo Do and Soo Bahk Do", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/10_07_2022_17_33_06_8283785.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

More than 230,000 have been displaced, and much of the region has been isolated by the floodwaters.\n\nMore storms are expected in the state, with lightning strikes and wind gusts reaching up to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) in the south, according to C\u00e1tia Valente, the meteorologist in the state\u00b4s situation room.\n\nStaffers of the state\u00b4s civil defense agency told The Associated Press they have been struggling to persuade residents of the city of Eldorado do Sul, one of the hardest hit by the floods, to leave their homes. It is located beside Porto Alegre, near the center of the state\u00b4s coastline. At least four people declined to evacuate.\n\nA flyover of Eldorado do Sul in a military helicopter showed hundreds of houses submerged, with only their roofs visible. Residents were using small boards, surfboards and personal watercraft to move around. Mayor Ernani de Freitas told local journalists that the city \"will be totally evacuated.\"\n\n\"It will take at least a year to recover,\" he said.\n\nCars sit on a submerged road in an area flooded by heavy rain in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, Wednesday, May 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Andre Penner)\n\nRio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite, speaking at a news conference late Tuesday, appealed to residents to stay out of harm's way, as the anticipated downpour may cause more severe flooding across the state.\n\n\"It isn't the time to return home,\" he said.\n\nThe civil defense agency's own urgent warning asking displaced residents not to return to flooded areas also stressed the risk of disease transmission.\n\nArmy Gen. Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, told the AP his team is working at full speed before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend. Moderate rain was falling Wednesday afternoon in the city.\n\n\"We hope the next rains are not like those we saw, but there's no way to be sure there won't be trouble ahead of us,\" Zucco said.\n\n\"At this moment we are focusing on finishing rescue operations and starting logistical support to the population. That's bringing water, medication, food and transportation for the sick to some hospital,\" the general added.\n\nHe also said some improvement in conditions for the day helped his men finally access some areas by land.\n\nA report by the National Confederation of Municipalities estimates damages at 4.6 billion reais ($930 million) in nearly 80% of Rio Grande do Sul's municipalities.\n\nGov. Leite has said that the enormous impact will require something akin to the Marshall Plan for Europe's post-WWII recovery. Already the state has asked the federal government to suspend debt payments and create a fund for the southern region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Congress passed a decree declaring a state of calamity in Rio Grande do Sul until the end of the year, allowing the federal government to quickly allocate money to mitigate the catastrophe and rebuild regions affected by the floods, bypassing a spending cap. The vote united supporters and opponents of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u00b4s government.\n\n\"There is no limit to the public spending necessary to resolve the problem of the calamity that today is ravaging Rio Grande do Sul state,\" Planning and Budget Minister Simone Tebet told Radio Gaucho in an interview.\n\n____\n\nS\u00e1 Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo.\n\nThe city of Porto Alegre is flooded after heavy rain in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, Wednesday, May 8, 2024.

The capital, Porto Alegre, has been virtually cut off, with the airport and bus station closed and main roads blocked due to the floodwaters.\n\nFive of the city's six water treatment facilities aren't working, and Porto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo ordered that water be used exclusively for \"essential consumption.\" Local shops have also been short on water supplies.\n\n\"We are living an unprecedented natural disaster and everyone needs to help,\" Melo told journalists. \"The shortage is real and it will take some time until it goes back to normal.\"\n\n\"I am getting water trucks to soccer fields and people will have to go there to get their water in bottles. I cannot get them to go home to home,\" the mayor added.\n\nThe most urgent need is drinking water, but food and personal hygiene products are also in short supply. Other Brazilian states are mobilizing trucks with donations bound for Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nResidents in Rio Grande do Sul who are able to flee are doing so, over fears of shortage and the spread of disease. However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall is could exceed 150 millimeters (5.9 inches) by early Wednesday.\n\nLate Monday, Rio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite issued an alert for several cities close to the massive Patos Lagoon. The floodwaters in Porto Alegre and other cities pass through the lagoon to the sea.\n\n\"The water level will rise and it will affect you,\" he said in a video broadcast on his social media channels. \"Please, believe the alerts and help us save lives. Let's reduce the damage so we can be together to rebuild.\"\n\nDamage from the rains has already forced more than 150,000 people from their homes. An additional 50,000 have taken refuge in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday, accompanied by Defense Minister Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva, among others.\n\nDuring Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the state's population.\n\nPublic health experts say there is growing risk of disease as much of the region remains underwater, warning that cases of dengue fever and leptospirosis in particular could rise sharply within days\n\nSecurity is another concern. Rio Grande do Sul's public security secretariat said in a statement that police will beef up operations to prevent looting and theft. Several volunteers working on rescue operations have been robbed as they tried to help in the Porto Alegre metropolitan region.\n\nAlso on Monday, three top-tier Rio Grande do Sul state soccer clubs whose stadiums are flooded urged Brazil's soccer federation to suspend their national league matches for the next 20 days because of the flooding. Brazil's soccer confederation said it would consider the request.\n\nREAD ALSO: Death toll passes 200 in flooding, Kenya postpones school reopening", "source": {"uri": "wltribune.com", "dataType":

The capital, Porto Alegre, has been virtually cut off, with the airport and bus station closed and main roads blocked because of the floodwaters.\n\nThe floods in Brazil are among extreme weather events being seen around the world.\n\nYoga teacher Maria Vit\u00f3ria Jorge's apartment building in downtown Porto Alegre is flooded, so she's leaving it behind, having withdrawn about 8,000 reais (US$1,600) from her savings to rent an apartment for herself and her parents elsewhere in the state.\n\n\"I can't shower at home, wash the dishes or even have drinkable water,\" the 35-year-old Jorge said in her car as she prepared to travel. She had just a gallon of water for the 200-kilometre (125-mile) drive to the city of Torres, so far unaffected by the floods.\n\nFive of the Porto Alegre's six water treatment facilities aren't working, and Porto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo on Monday decreed that water be used exclusively for \"essential consumption.\"\n\n\"We are living an unprecedented natural disaster and everyone needs to help,\" Melo told journalists. \"I am getting water trucks to soccer fields and people will have to go there to get their water in bottles.

Some people have tried to buy bottled water since the weekend, and when they could find it, their purchases were limited to two five-litre (1.3-gallon) bottles.\n\nPublic health experts say there is also growing risk of disease as much of the region remains submerged, warning that cases of dengue fever and leptospirosis, a bacterial disease, in particular could rise sharply within days.\n\nAdriano Hueck on Tuesday was attempting to retrieve medicine stocked at a friend's warehouse, which is partially flooded.\n\n\"If we can save some of it, there's still a chance it can be useful in hospitals,\" said 53-year-old Hueck, who then pointed toward another part of the city. \"My house is somewhere there. You can't even see its roof now.\"\n\nLike Jorge, the yoga teacher, residents in Rio Grande do Sul who are able to flee are doing so, amid fears of shortage and disease. However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nClose to the airport, about 100 people of a nearby slum set up tents on the road, hoping to return to their shacks on small boats to try to save some of their belongings. Some roasted chunks of meat on improvised grills.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall could exceed 150 millimetres (nearly six inches) by early Wednesday.\n\nLate Monday, Rio Grande do Sul Gov. Eduardo Leite issued an alert for several cities close to the huge Patos Lagoon. The floodwaters in Porto Alegre and other cities pass through the lagoon to the sea.\n\n\"The water level will rise and it will affect you,\" he said in a video broadcast on his social media channels. \"Please, believe the alerts and help us save lives. Let's reduce the damage so we can be together to rebuild.\"\n\nPorto Alegre's metropolitan region is one of Brazil's largest, home to around four million people.\n\nDamage from the rains has already forced more than 150,000 people from their homes. An additional 50,000 have taken refuge in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday, accompanied by Defense Minister Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva, among others.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that they are concerned about the risks of hypothermia, as the temperature should drop to 10 C (50 F) on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Melo issued a plea for more donations of blankets.\n\nAnd it isn't just residents who are at risk.\n\n\"Our personnel has been wet for five days, shivering in the cold, staying up all night, in deficient sanitary conditions, because we're sharing the same facilities with the displaced,\" Gen. Hertz Pires do Nascimento, the army commander of Brazil's southern region, told journalists.\n\nDuring Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the state's population.\n\nSecurity is another concern. Rio Grande do Sul's public security secretariat said in a statement that police will beef up operations to prevent looting and theft. Brazil's national guard is mobilizing to the state to reinforce security.\n\n\"Even a boat was stolen this morning from the people working on the rescue. Jet Skis and houses were looted. This is deplorable and must be denounced,\" Paulo Pimenta, Lula's spokesperson, said Tuesday at a news conference.\n\nThe flood disaster is also likely to affect the South American country's food supplies. Rio Grande do Sul produces 70 per cent of an basic Brazilian foodstuff: rice.\n\n\"With the rains, I think we've definitely delayed the harvest in Rio Grande do Sul. So, if needed to balance production, we'll have to import rice, import beans,\" Lula said in a radio interview at Brazil's public broadcaster.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news",

I cannot get them to go home to home.\"\n\nThe most urgent need is drinking water, but food and personal hygiene products are also in short supply. Other Brazilian states are mobilizing trucks with donations bound for Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThere were long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets in Porto Alegre on Tuesday. Some people have tried to buy bottled water since the weekend, and when they could find it, their purchases were limited to two five-liter (1.3-gallon) bottles.\n\nPublic health experts say there is also growing risk of disease as much of the region remains submerged, warning that cases of dengue fever and leptospirosis, a bacterial disease, in particular could rise sharply within days.\n\nAdriano Hueck on Tuesday was attempting to retrieve medicine stocked at a friend's warehouse, which is partially flooded.\n\n\"If we can save some of it, there's still a chance it can be useful in hospitals,\" said 53-year-old Hueck, who then pointed toward another part of the city. \"My house is somewhere there. You can't even see its roof now.\"\n\nLike Jorge, the yoga teacher, residents in Rio Grande do Sul who are able to flee are doing so, amid fears of shortage and disease. However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nClose to the airport, about 100 people of a nearby slum set up tents on the road, hoping to return to their shacks on small boats to try to save some of their belongings. Some roasted chunks of meat on improvised grills.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall could exceed 150 millimeters (nearly six inches) by early Wednesday.\n\nLate Monday, Rio Grande do Sul Gov. Eduardo Leite issued an alert for several cities close to the huge Patos Lagoon. The floodwaters in Porto Alegre and other cities pass through the lagoon to the sea.\n\n\"The water level will rise and it will affect you,\" he said in a video broadcast on his social media channels. \"Please, believe the alerts and help us save lives. Let's reduce the damage so we can be together to rebuild.\"\n\nPorto Alegre's metropolitan region is one of Brazil's largest, home to around 4 million people.\n\nDamage from the rains has already forced more than 150,000 people from their homes. An additional 50,000 have taken refuge in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday, accompanied by Defense Minister Jose Mcio, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva, among others.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that they are concerned about the risks of hypothermia, as the temperature should drop to 10 C (50 F) on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Melo issued a plea for more donations of blankets.\n\n\"Our personnel has been wet for five days, shivering in the cold, staying up all night, in deficient sanitary conditions, because we're sharing the same facilities with the displaced,\" Gen. Hertz Pires do Nascimento, the army commander of Brazil's southern region, told journalists.\n\nDuring Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the state's population.\n\nSecurity is another concern. Rio Grande do Sul's public security secretariat said in a statement that police will beef up operations to prevent looting and theft. Brazil's national guard is mobilizing to the state to reinforce security.\n\n\"Even a boat was stolen this morning from the people working on the rescue. Jet Skis and houses were looted. This is deplorable and must be denounced,\" Paulo Pimenta, Lula's spokesperson, said Tuesday at a news conference.\n\nThe flood disaster is also likely to affect the South American country's food supplies. Rio Grande do Sul produces 70% of an basic Brazilian foodstuff: rice.\n\n\"With the rains, I think we've definitely delayed the harvest in Rio Grande do Sul. So, if needed to balance production, we'll have to import rice, import beans,\" Lula said in a radio interview at Brazil's public broadcaster.\n\nBy MAURICIO SAVARESE and GABRIELA SA PESSOA Associated

Entire families were leaving on foot, carrying belongings in backpacks and shopping carts.\n\n\"We've been without food for three days and we've only just got this blanket. I'm with people I don't even know, I don't know where my family is,\" said a young man who gave his name as Ricardo Junior.\n\nThe flooding has hampered rescue efforts, with dozens of people still waiting to be evacuated by boat or helicopter from stricken homes. Small boats crisscrossed the flooded town searching for survivors.\n\nThe state's Civil Defense agency said the death toll had risen to 90 with another four deaths being investigated, while 131 people were still unaccounted for and 155,000 homeless.\n\nThe heavy rains that began last week have caused rivers to flood, inundating whole towns and destroying roads and bridges.\n\nRain is forecast to let up on Thursday but then continue through the weekend.\n\nClimate experts attributed the extreme rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul to the confluence of a heatwave caused by this year's El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific and brings rain to southern Brazil; a weaker cold front with rain and gales coming from the Antarctic; and unusual warmth in the Atlantic also raising humidity.\n\nGlobal warming exacerbates these phenomena and intensifies the effects between such systems, making weather unpredictable, said Marcelo Schneider, a National Meteorology Institute (Inmet) researcher.\n\nELECTRICITY CUTS\n\nIn Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, downtown streets were under water after the Guaiba River breached its banks with record water levels.\n\nPorto Alegre residents faced empty supermarket shelves and closed gas stations, with shops rationing sales of mineral water. The city distributed water in trucks to hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe floods have also impacted water and electricity services, with more than 1.4 million affected overall, according to Civil Defense.\n\nAlmost half a million people were without power in Porto Alegre and outlying towns as electricity companies cut off supplies for security reasons in flooded neighborhoods. National grid operator ONS said five hydroelectric dams and transmission lines were shut down due to the heavy rains.\n\nThe city's airport, its apron under water, has suspended all flights since Friday.\n\nFuel shortages were reported as state-run oil company Petrobras said it was having trouble moving diesel from its refinery in badly-flooded Canoas within metropolitan Porto Alegre, a senior government official said.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on a government television program that the extent of the damage will not be known until the waters subside. He promised federal aid for the state in what is considered its worst ever climate disaster.\n\nJP Morgan economists projected that the impact of the floods on Brazil's economy would be a modest dent in GDP growth and a marginal increase in inflation, mainly due to higher prices for rice that is largely produced in Rio Grande do Sul. The government said Brazil will import rice to stabilize the market.\n\nBesides destroying critical infrastructure, the heavy rains and flooding have left grains fields under water and killed livestock, interrupting the soy harvest and halting work at multiple meat plants.\n\nThe Rio Grande port, a major port for grain exports, was operating normally, the state's port authority said. However, main access roads were impassable, disrupting grain deliveries to the port as trucks had to make a wide detour, exporters said.", "source": {"uri": "kathmandupost.com", "dataType": "news",

She had just a gallon of water for the 200-kilometer (125-mile) drive to the city of Torres, so far unaffected by the floods.\n\nFive of the Porto Alegre's six water treatment facilities aren't working, and Porto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo on Monday decreed that water be used exclusively for \"essential consumption.\"\n\n\"We are living an unprecedented natural disaster and everyone needs to help,\" Melo told journalists. \"I am getting water trucks to soccer fields and people will have to go there to get their water in bottles. I cannot get them to go home to home.\"\n\nThe most urgent need is drinking water, but food and personal hygiene products are also in short supply. Other Brazilian states are mobilizing trucks with donations bound for Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThere were long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets in Porto Alegre on Tuesday. Some people have tried to buy bottled water since the weekend, and when they could find it, their purchases were limited to two five-liter (1.3-gallon) bottles.\n\nPublic health experts say there is also growing risk of disease as much of the region remains submerged, warning that cases of dengue fever and leptospirosis, a bacterial disease, in particular could rise sharply within days.\n\nAdriano Hueck on Tuesday was attempting to retrieve medicine stocked at a friend's warehouse, which is partially flooded.\n\n\"If we can save some of it, there's still a chance it can be useful in hospitals,\" said 53-year-old Hueck, who then pointed toward another part of the city. \"My house is somewhere there. You can't even see its roof now.\"\n\nLike Jorge, the yoga teacher, residents in Rio Grande do Sul who are able to flee are doing so, amid fears of shortage and disease. However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nClose to the airport, about 100 people of a nearby slum set up tents on the road, hoping to return to their shacks on small boats to try to save some of their belongings. Some roasted chunks of meat on improvised grills.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall could exceed 150 millimeters (nearly six inches) by early Wednesday.\n\nLate Monday, Rio Grande do Sul Gov. Eduardo Leite issued an alert for several cities close to the huge Patos Lagoon. The floodwaters in Porto Alegre and other cities pass through the lagoon to the sea.\n\n\"The water level will rise and it will affect you,\" he said in a video broadcast on his social media channels. \"Please, believe the alerts and help us save lives. Let's reduce the damage so we can be together to rebuild.\"\n\nPorto Alegre's metropolitan region is one of Brazil's largest, home to around 4 million people.\n\nDamage from the rains has already forced more than 150,000 people from their homes. An additional 50,000 have taken refuge in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday, accompanied by Defense Minister Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva, among others.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that they are concerned about the risks of hypothermia, as the temperature should drop to 10 C (50 F) on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Melo issued a plea for more donations of blankets.\n\nAnd it isn't just residents who are at risk.\n\n\"Our personnel has been wet for five days, shivering in the cold, staying up all night, in deficient sanitary conditions, because we're sharing the same facilities with the displaced,\" Gen. Hertz Pires do Nascimento, the army commander of Brazil's southern region, told journalists.\n\nDuring Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the state's population.\n\nSecurity is another concern. Rio Grande do Sul's public security secretariat said in a statement that police will beef up operations to prevent looting and theft. Brazil's national guard is mobilizing to the state to reinforce security.\n\n\"Even a boat was stolen this morning from the people working on the rescue. Jet Skis and houses were looted. This is deplorable and must be denounced,\" Paulo Pimenta, Lula's spokesperson, said Tuesday at a news conference.\n\nThe flood disaster is also likely to affect the South American country's food supplies. Rio Grande do Sul produces 70% of an basic Brazilian foodstuff: rice.\n\n\"With the rains, I think we've definitely delayed the harvest in Rio Grande do Sul. So, if needed to balance production, we'll have to import rice, import beans,\" Lula said in a radio interview at Brazil's public broadcaster.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news",

Most shops have run out of bottled water.\n\n\"This is horrible. We have children,\" said 27-year-old Gabriela Almeida, queuing at a public tap with a one-year-old in her arms.\n\nIndividuals and businesses with hoses were doing what they could to help, with 48-year-old Benildo Carvalho, an Alvorada resident, filling neighbours' bottles as a line formed outside his home.\n\n\"It's a matter of solidarity,\" he said: \"You cannot deny people water.\"\n\nOnly two of Porto Alegre's six water treatment plants were functioning, the mayor's office said, with hospitals and shelters being supplied by tankers.\n\nThe Brazilian Navy said it would send its \"Atlantic\" vessel - Latin America's largest - to Rio Grande do Sul on Wednesday with two mobile water treatment stations.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said emergency funds would be freed up to tackle the crisis, vowing there would be \"no lack of resources to meet the needs of Rio Grande do Sul\".\n\nSome 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were hard at work in planes, boats and even jet skis to rescue those trapped or transport aid.\n\nBrazil's neighbours, Uruguay and Argentina, have sent rescue equipment and trained personnel, while footballer Neymar dispatched a private plane of humanitarian aid to the region. He said on Instagram he was \"praying for everything to return to normal\".\n\nBut weather forecasts have shown that the flooding is unlikely to abate, with concerns being raised that the situation could worsen further.\n\nThe Inmet meteorological institute has warned of possible storms in the south of Rio Grande do Sul until Wednesday, followed by rainfall in the centre and north, which it said could imperil rescue efforts.\n\nWeather agency MetSul said the flooding has \"changed the map of the metropolitan region\" of Porto Alegre.\n\nLula warned the country could be forced to \"import rice and beans\" if harvests are delayed by the crisis, with Rio Grande do Sul being Brazil's second-largest soybean producing state and a region of agricultural importance.\n\nMeanwhile, reports have emerged of residents refusing to leave their homes and evacuate to shelters, with police saying looters had begun targeting empty properties.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute.

Rio Grande do Sul's public security secretariat said in a statement that police will beef up operations to prevent looting and theft. Several volunteers working on rescue operations have been robbed as they tried to help in the Porto Alegre metropolitan region.\n\nAlso on Monday, three top-tier Rio Grande do Sul state soccer clubs whose stadiums are flooded urged Brazil's soccer federation to suspend their national league matches for the next 20 days because of the flooding.

More than 1.45 million people across 417 of the state's 497 cities have been affected and the latest estimates suggest more than 200,000 people have been displaced.\n\nRio Grande do Sul has been virtually cut off from the rest of Brazil with roads flooded. The state's main airport has been inundated by water and could be out of use for at least 30 days.\n\nOfficials have said it is the \"worst natural calamity\" to hit the state.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, the capital city of Rio Grande do Sul, several water plants have stopped functioning leaving an estimated 80 per cent of the population without access to drinking water. Supplies are being rationed and officials are distributing drinking water to hospitals and shelters in tankers.\n\nMany have also been left without electricity after power companies cut off supplies due to security reasons.\n\nWith thousands of people displaced, homes and businesses destroyed and widespread destruction, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva promised the government would do \"everything in [its] power\" to contribute to the recovery of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nBut rescue efforts have been hampered by looting and the flood waters that still linger in the city. In Porto Alegre, police have been providing volunteers with security patrols using boats and even jet skis.\n\nThousands are still waiting to be evacuated and officials have called for anyone who owns \"any kind of boat\" to offer it to emergency teams. Around 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers are working to rescue people and transport aid.\n\nBrazilian Paralympic fencer Vanderson Chaves is one of those impacted by the disaster. He told the Associated Press that he has faced many challenges in his career but none as fearsome as these floods.\n\n\"There's no way this wouldn't affect me. To compete and to train well, you need to be well psychologically. And I'm not,\" he said. The waters washed away his equipment, dozens of medals, his passport and may even have thwarted his chances of reaching the Paris Games in September. He has also been displaced by the flooding.\n\n\"I come from an impoverished area of Porto Alegre. Everything for me is more difficult to achieve. I am Black, I am disabled. And now this.\"\n\nResidents are also reportedly facing shortages of essential supplies including drinking water. In many places, access for supply trucks or employees is completely cut off.\n\nDownpours started on 29 April with more than 300 millimetres of rain falling in less than a week, according to Brazil's National Institute of Meteorology (INMET). Flooding started in the north of the state and then subsequently inundated more southerly cities including Porto Alegre.\n\nIt is the fourth environmental disaster Rio Grande do Sul has seen in a year after flooding hit in July, September and November of 2023.\n\nStill reeling from massive flooding, the state now faces the possibility of further storms. Brazil's national centre for natural disasters has warned the region is at \"high risk\" of more flooding. Weather forecaster MetSul said Rio Grande do Sul could face \"very large\" floods of \"serious proportions\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Porto Alegre officials warned civilian rescuers to halt their operations because of forecasts for rain, lightning and strong winds. INMET has also forecast a cold front this weekend with additional rains which will be particularly intense in the north and east of the state.\n\nArmy General Marcelo Zucco, one of the coordinators of rescue operations, told AP that his team were working at full speed before heavy rains that are forecast to hit the Porto Alegre area this weekend. Some improvement in conditions had helped his tea finally access some areas by land on Wednesday but more rain started to fall on the city that afternoon.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.D._Chaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G.D.

We have children,\" said 27-year-old Gabriela Almeida, queuing at a public tap with a one-year-old in her arms.\n\nIndividuals and businesses with wells were doing what they could to help.\n\nAlvorada resident Benildo Carvalho, 48, was one of them -- filling neighbours' bottles with a hose as a line of people formed outside his house.\n\n\"It's a matter of solidarity,\" he told AFP. \"You cannot deny people water.\"\n\nOnly two of Porto Alegre's six water treatment plants were functioning, the mayor's office said, and hospitals and shelters were being supplied by tankers.\n\nThe Brazilian Navy said it would send its \"Atlantic\" vessel -- Latin America's largest -- to Rio Grande do Sul on Wednesday with two mobile water treatment stations.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said more emergency funds would be freed up Tuesday, vowing there would be \"no lack of resources to meet the needs of Rio Grande do Sul\".\n\nSome 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were hard at work in planes and boats, even jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.\n\nBrazil's neighbours Uruguay and Argentina have sent rescue equipment and trained personnel.\n\nCelebrities were also chipping in, with footballer Neymar sending a plane with donations.

Fabiano Saldanha, 30, said he and three friends have used jet skis to rescue about 50 people since Friday in islands that are part of Porto Alegre. \"The only thing we hear when we enter a street is 'help,' 'help,'\" Saldanha said.\n\nDuring his weekly address to crowds in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, Pope Francis said on Sunday he was praying for the people of the state. \"May the Lord receive the dead, comfort their families and all those who had to leave their homes,\" the pope said.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@news9live.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_watercraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal watercraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter's_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Peter's Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brazilflood.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Tiago Franco, a firefighter from Sao Paulo deployed to lead the rescue, was quoted as saying in a statement from that state\u00b4s security secretariat. \"We tried to approach in a calm way.\"\n\nFirefighters and veterinarians climbed onto the partially submerged roof, sedated and immobilized the horse and then lay it on an inflatable raft - all 770 pounds of it. The operation involved four inflatable boats and four support vessels, with firefighters, soldiers and other volunteers.\n\nThe rescue was broadcast live on television networks that filmed from their helicopters. Social media influencer Felipe Neto sent out updates to his almost 17 million followers on X as the rescue was underway. Afterwards, he offered to adopt it.\n\nFirefighters use a raft to transport a horse after rescuing it from a roof, where it was trapped for days amid flooding, after heavy rain in Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, Thursday, May 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Wesley Santos)\n\n\"Caramelo, Brazil loves you!!! My God, what happiness,\" he wrote.\n\nPresident Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's wife, Janja, posted a video of herself sharing the good news with the Brazilian leader, whispering into his ear at an official event. He smiled, gave a thumbs up and hugged her to him. Rio Grande do Sul's Gov. Eduardo Leite also celebrated the rescue, posting on X: \"All lives matter, we stand firm!\"\n\nThe stranded horse is just one of many animals rescue workers have been striving to save in recent days. Rio Grande do Sul state agents have rescued about 10,000 animals since last week, while those in municipalities and volunteers have saved thousands more, according to the state's housing secretariat.\n\nAnimal protection groups and volunteers have been sharing images of difficult rescues and heartwarming scenes of pets reuniting with their owners on social media. One video that went viral shows a man crying inside a boat, hugging his four dogs after rescuers went back to his home to save them.\n\nHeavy rains and flooding in Rio Grande do Sul have killed at least 107 people. Another 136 are reported missing and more than 230,000 have been displaced, according to state authorities. There is no official tally for the number of animals that have been killed or are missing, but local media have estimated the number is in the thousands.\n\nCarla Sassi, chairwoman of Grad, a Brazilian nonprofit that rescues animals after disasters, said she is meeting with state government officials in Canoas to discuss emergency measures to rescue pets.\n\nS\u00e1 Pessoa reported from S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe area near the Guaiba River is flooded after heavy rain in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, Thursday, May 9, 2024.

There is no other way,\" 30-year-old resident Luan Pas told AFP next to a street turned into a stagnant, smelly river.\n\nOperations at the port of Porto Alegre have been suspended and its international airport indefinitely closed.\n\nThe Air Force said the military base outside town will receive commercial flights transporting aid and passengers.\n\nIn a rare dry spot in Porto Alegre's historic center, dozens of people gathered around a generator rented by a pharmacy on Wednesday to charge their cell phones.\n\n\"This is a parallel universe,\" said one of them, university professor Daniela da Silva, 30.\n\nThe Inmet meteorological institute has warned of more storms with heavy rains and winds in the south of the state and downpours over the weekend in the Porto Alegre region.\n\nDue to climate change, extreme or rare events \"are becoming more frequent and more extreme,\" Jose Marengo, research coordinator at Brazil's National Center for Natural Disaster Monitoring (Cemaden), told AFP.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, said it would import 200,000 tons of rice to guarantee supplies and preempt price speculation. The flooded region supplies more than two-thirds of the rice consumed in Brazil.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres extended his condolences in a statement to the people of Brazil, saying that

The animal was secured by firemen and loaded into a Zodiac inflatable boat to take it to safety.\n\nThe floods have destroyed infrastructure and bridges, blocking access to Porto Alegre, where supermarket shelves are empty and looting has been reported at night.\n\nGovernor Eduardo Leite said initial calculations indicate that Rio Grande do Sul will need at least 19 billion reais ($3.68 billion) to rebuild from the damage, which has extended into farm areas around the capital.\n\n\"The effect of the floods and the extent of the tragedy are devastating,\" he said on social media.\n\nIn Brasilia, the federal government estimated the fiscal impact of the flooding at 7.7 billion reais ($1.49 billion), mostly due to the injection of funds into a support program for small businesses hit by the floods.\n\n\"This doesn't end here,\" President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said at an event announcing steps to help the stricken state. Lula said the full extent of Rio Grande do Sul's needs would be known only when the water recedes.\n\nRead more:\n\nFIFA report rates Brazil bid higher than Germany to host 2027 Women's World Cup\n\nFloods misery reminder of changing climate's role in supercharging rain", "source": {"uri": "english.alarabiya.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Arabiya English"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_arabiya_english@english.alarabiya.net", "name": "Al Arabiya English", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras\u00edlia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bras\u00edlia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bras\u00edlia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2024/05/09/ae05e669-d9ee-445e-bccf-205327c622fb/ae05e669-d9ee-445e-bccf-205327c622fb_16x9_600x338.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549109", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The capital, Porto Alegre, has been virtually cut off, with the airport and bus station closed and main roads blocked because of the floodwaters.\n\nThe floods in Brazil are among extreme weather events being seen around the world.\n\nYoga teacher Maria Vit\u00f3ria Jorge's apartment building in downtown Porto Alegre is flooded, so she's leaving it behind, having withdrawn about $1,600 from her savings to rent an apartment for herself and her parents elsewhere in the state.\n\n\"I can't shower at home, wash the dishes or even have drinkable water,\" the 35-year-old Jorge said in her car as she prepared to travel. She had just a gallon of water for the 125-mile drive to the city of Torres, so far unaffected by the floods.\n\nFive of Porto Alegre's six water treatment facilities aren't working, and Porto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo on Monday decreed that water be used exclusively for \"essential consumption.\"\n\n\"We are living an unprecedented natural disaster and everyone needs to help,\" Melo told journalists. \"I am getting water trucks to soccer fields and people will have to go there to get their water in bottles. I cannot get them to go home to home.\"\n\nThe most urgent need is drinking water, but food and personal hygiene products are also in short supply. Other Brazilian states are mobilizing trucks with donations bound for Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThere were long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets in Porto Alegre on Tuesday. Some people have tried to buy bottled water since the weekend, and when they could find it, their purchases were limited to two 1.3-gallon bottles.\n\nPublic health experts say there is also growing risk of disease as much of the region remains submerged, warning that cases of dengue fever and leptospirosis, a bacterial disease, in particular could rise sharply within days.\n\n<span class=\"Object\" id=\"OBJ_PREFIX_DWT168_com_zimbra_url\" role=\"link\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 153); text-decoration-line: none; cursor: pointer;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fcd-wSFNN5c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 153); cursor: pointer;\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fcd-wSFNN5c</a></span>\" title=\"Aerial video of flooding in Brazil\" frameborder=\"O\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen>\n\nAdriano Hueck on Tuesday was attempting to retrieve medicine stocked at a friend's warehouse, which is partially flooded.\n\n\"If we can save some of it, there's still a chance it can be useful in hospitals,\" said 53-year-old Hueck, who then pointed toward another part of the city. \"My house is somewhere there. You can't even see its roof now.\"\n\nLike Jorge, the yoga teacher, residents in Rio Grande do Sul who are able to flee are doing so, amid fears of shortage and disease. However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nClose to the airport, about 100 people of a nearby slum set up tents on the road, hoping to return to their shacks on small boats to try to save some of their belongings.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front was forecast to bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall could exceed nearly six inches by early Wednesday.\n\nLate Monday, Rio Grande do Sul Gov. Eduardo Leite issued an alert for several cities close to the huge Patos Lagoon. The floodwaters in Porto Alegre and other cities pass through the lagoon to the sea.\n\n\"The water level will rise and it will affect you,\" he said in a video broadcast on his social media channels. \"Please, believe the alerts and help us save lives. Let's reduce the damage so we can be together to rebuild.\"\n\nPeople rest in a shelter after their homes were flooded by heavy rains in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, Saturday, May 4, 2024.

On the outskirts of Eldorado do Sul, 17 kilometers (10.5 miles) from the state capital of Porto Alegre, many people were sleeping on the roadside and told Reuters they were going hungry. Entire families were leaving on foot, carrying belongings in backpacks and shopping carts.\n\n\"We've been without food for three days and we've only just got this blanket. I'm with people I don't even know, I don't know where my family is,\" said a young man who gave his name as Ricardo Junior.\n\nThe flooding has hampered rescue efforts, with dozens of people still waiting to be evacated by boat or helicopter from stricken homes. Small boats crisscrossed the flooded town searching for survivors. The state's Civil Defense agency said the death toll had risen to 90 with another four deaths being investigated, while 131 people were still unaccounted for and 155,000 homeless.\n\nThe heavy rains that began last week have caused rivers to flood, inundating whole towns and destroying roads and bridges.Rain is forecast to let up on Thursday but then continue through the weekend.\n\nClimate experts attributed the extreme rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul to the confluence of a heatwave caused by this year's El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific and brings rain to southern Brazil; a weaker cold front with rain and gales coming from the Antarctic; and unusual warmth in the Atlantic also raising humidity.\n\nGlobal warming exacerbates these phenomena and intensifies the effects between such systems, making weather unpredictable, said Marcelo Schneider, a National Meteorology Institute (Inmet) researcher.\n\nELECTRICITY CUTS\n\nIn Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, downtown streets were under water after the Guaiba River breached its banks with record water levels.\n\nPorto Alegre residents faced empty supermarket shelves and closed gas stations, with shops rationing sales of mineral water. The city distributed water in trucks to hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe floods have also impacted water and electricity services, with more than 1.4 million affected overall, according to Civil Defense. Almost half a million people were without power in Porto Alegre and outlying towns as electricity companies cut off supplies for security reasons in flooded neighborhoods. National grid operator ONS said five hydroelectric dams and transmission lines were shut down due to the heavy rains. The city's airport, its apron under water, has suspended all flights since Friday.\n\nFuel shortages were reported as state-run oil company Petrobras said it was having trouble moving diesel from its refinery in badly-flooded Canoas within metropolitan Porto Alegre, a senior government official said.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on a government television program that the extent of the damage will not be known until the waters subside. He promised federal aid for the state in what is considered its worst ever climate disaster.\n\nJP Morgan economists projected that the impact of the floods on Brazil's economy would be a modest dent in GDP growth and a marginal increase in inflation, mainly due to higher prices for rice that is largely produced in Rio Grande do Sul. The government said Brazil will import rice to stabilize the market.\n\nBesides destroying critical infrastructure, the heavy rains and flooding have left grains fields under water and killed livestock, interrupting the soy harvest and halting work at multiple meat plants.\n\nThe Rio Grande port, a major port for grain exports, was operating normally, the state's port authority said. However, main access roads were impassable, disrupting grain deliveries to the port as trucks had to make a wide detour, exporters said.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news",

During his weekly address to crowds in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, Pope Francis said on Sunday he was praying for the people of the state.\n\n\"May the Lord receive the dead, comfort their families and all those who had to leave their homes,\" the pope said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_watercraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal watercraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter's_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Peter's Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_29_32_8711902.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

There is no other way,\" 30-year-old resident Luan Pas told AFP next to a street turned into a stagnant, smelly river.\n\nOperations at the port of Porto Alegre have been suspended and its international airport indefinitely closed.\n\nThe Air Force said the military base outside town will receive commercial flights transporting aid and passengers.\n\nIn a rare dry spot in Porto Alegre's historic center, dozens of people gathered around a generator rented by a pharmacy on Wednesday to charge their cell phones.\n\n\"This is a parallel universe,\" said one of them, university professor Daniela da Silva, 30.\n\nThe Inmet meteorological institute has warned of more storms with heavy rains and winds in the south of the state and downpours over the weekend in the Porto Alegre region.\n\nDue to climate change, extreme or rare events \"are becoming more frequent and more extreme,\" Jose Marengo, research coordinator at Brazil's National Center for Natural Disaster Monitoring (Cemaden), told AFP.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, said it would import 200,000 tons of rice to guarantee supplies and preempt price speculation.

Entire families were leaving on foot, carrying belongings in backpacks and shopping carts.\n\n\"We've been without food for three days and we've only just got this blanket. I'm with people I don't even know, I don't know where my family is,\" said a young man on Tuesday who gave his name as Ricardo Junior.\n\nThe flooding has hampered rescue efforts, with dozens of people still waiting to be evacuated by boat or helicopter from stricken homes. Small boats crisscrossed the flooded town searching for survivors.\n\nThe state's Civil Defense agency said the death toll had risen to 90 with another four deaths being investigated, while 131 people were still unaccounted for and 155,000 homeless.\n\nThe heavy rains that began last week have caused rivers to flood, inundating whole towns and destroying roads and bridges.\n\nRain is forecast to let up on Thursday but then continue through the weekend.\n\nClimate experts attributed the extreme rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul to the confluence of a heatwave caused by this year's El Nino phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific and brings rain to southern Brazil, a weaker cold front with rain and gales coming from the Antarctic, and unusual warmth in the Atlantic also raising humidity.\n\nGlobal warming exacerbates these phenomena and intensifies the effects between such systems, making weather unpredictable, said Marcelo Schneider, a National Meteorology Institute (Inmet) researcher.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, downtown streets were under water after the Guaiba River breached its banks with record water levels.\n\nPorto Alegre residents faced empty supermarket shelves and closed gas stations, with shops rationing sales of mineral water. The city distributed water in trucks to hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe floods have also impacted water and electricity services, with more than 1.4 million affected overall, according to Civil Defense.\n\nAlmost half a million people were without power in Porto Alegre and outlying towns as electricity companies cut off supplies for security reasons in flooded neighbourhoods.\n\nNational grid operator ONS said five hydroelectric dams and transmission lines were shut down due to the heavy rains.\n\nThe city's airport, its apron under water, has suspended all flights since Friday.\n\nFuel shortages were reported as state-run oil company Petrobras said it was having trouble moving diesel from its refinery in badly flooded Canoas within metropolitan Porto Alegre, a senior government official said.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on a government TV program that the extent of the damage will not be known until the waters subside. He promised federal aid for the state in what is considered its worst ever climate disaster.\n\nJP Morgan economists projected that the impact of the floods on Brazil's economy would be a modest dent in GDP growth and a marginal increase in inflation, mainly due to higher prices for rice that is largely produced in Rio Grande do Sul. The government said Brazil will import rice to stabilise the market.\n\nBesides destroying critical infrastructure, the heavy rains and flooding have left grains fields under water and killed livestock, interrupting the soy harvest and halting work at multiple meat plants.\n\nThe Rio Grande port, a major port for grain exports, was operating normally, the state's port authority said. However, main access roads were impassable, disrupting grain deliveries to the port as trucks had to make a wide detour, exporters said.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news",

Observers say the true impact of the floods that have displaced more than 156,000 people and affected more than 1.3 million is not likely to be known for weeks.\n\nThe floods have wreaked havoc across nearly 350 out of 497 cities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, critically damaging infrastructure, including roads, bridges and causing the partial collapse of a dam at a hydroelectric plant. More than 100 people are known to have been killed and at least 131 are still missing, according to information from the civil defense force involved in disaster relief.\n\nPresident Inacio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, declared a state of emergency, echoing the sentiments of Rio Grande do Sul Governor Eduardo Leite, who ominously predicted a substantial rise in the death toll as rescue missions expand their reach, and said the \"scenes are out of a war\", in comments over the weekend.\n\n\"We ... knew that heavy and intense rains would come, but we never imagined this magnitude,\" Marcelo Schneider, a meteorologist and district coordinator for Meteorology for southern Brazil at the National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet), told China Daily.\n\n\"The warnings were there,\" Schneider said. \"One of the main factors is the intersection of two events: the El Nino and La Nina phenomena.\"\n\nWhile heavy rain is not unusual in this part of Brazil, the sheer amount that fell over the past few days has been historic.\n\nInmet first alerted about upcoming heavy rains on April 26, warning of 100 mm of rain over the following weekend and winds in excess of 70 km/h. MetSul Meteorologica, a meteorological monitoring entity, also warned of severe risks of flooding. In the last few days of the month, the state received roughly 70 percent of the rain it usually receives in whole month, and the downpours continued into May.\n\n\"Despite improvements in parts of the state, some areas will remain under severe conditions for a very long time,\" MetSul said in a statement, noting that the waters had changed the urban landscape of Porto Alegre, the largest city in the Rio Grande do Sul state.\n\nInmet warned this week that rains would continue in the southernmost part of the state, with the downpour likely to exceed 150 mm by the morning of April 8 in some areas.\n\nAuthorities are now worried about drinking water running out.\n\nIt may have been \"the worst meteorological catastrophe\" in the state's history, said Paulo Pimenta, Lula's press secretary.\n\nRobson Cardoch Valdez, an economist and professor of international relations at the Brazilian Institute of Education, Development and Research, said the ramifications of this natural disaster extend beyond the immediate threat to lives.\n\nValdez, who works as an advisor to the Rio Grande do Sul government, suggested that the economic tremors of the devastation could ripple through the country for years, particularly in sectors like agriculture and oil production.\n\nThe floods have disrupted business operations, with some airports suspending flights and train services also disrupted. The extensive damage to infrastructure means a laborious and costly road to recovery.\n\n\"Once the water recedes, it will be possible to have a more specific (idea) of the economic impact of the rain, but ... at this moment we are only working with estimates ... to assist in everything necessary to rebuild the physical structure of Rio Grande do Sul,\" Valdez told China Daily.\n\nThe rebuilding could take some time. More rain is expected in the coming days and could get heavy again between May 10 and 15, according to MetSul.\n\nAdding to the complexity of the recovery, Rio Grande do Sul, a key agricultural hub, is bracing for a spike in the prices of staple crops and potential inflationary pressures on food products as a result of the floods.\n\nValdez highlighted the anticipated impact on agriculture, an industry critical to Rio Grande do Sul state and Brazil as a whole. The floods will likely impact crop production and livestock rearing and are expected to lead to an uptick in the prices of rice, corn, tomatoes and beef, among other staples.\n\nThe expected inflation, coupled with the costs associated with the extensive rebuilding of the state's physical infrastructure, presents a multifaceted challenge for federal and state authorities.\n\nThe massive floods came just seven months after an extratropical cyclone hit the region with heavy rains that caused floods and killed dozens.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title":

Entire families were leaving on foot, carrying belongings in backpacks and shopping carts.\n\n\"We've been without food for three days and we've only just got this blanket. I'm with people I don't even know, I don't know where my family is,\" said a young man who gave his name as Ricardo Junior.\n\nThe flooding has hampered rescue efforts, with dozens of people still waiting to be evacuated by boat or helicopter from stricken homes. Small boats crisscrossed the flooded town searching for survivors.\n\nThe state's Civil Defense agency said the death toll had risen to 90 with another four deaths being investigated, while 131 people were still unaccounted for and 155,000 homeless.\n\nThe heavy rains that began last week have caused rivers to flood, inundating whole towns and destroying roads and bridges.\n\nRain is forecast to let up on Thursday but then continue through the weekend.\n\nClimate experts attributed the extreme rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul to the confluence of a heatwave caused by this year's El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific and brings rain to southern Brazil; a weaker cold front with rain and gales coming from the Antarctic; and unusual warmth in the Atlantic also raising humidity.\n\nGlobal warming exacerbates these phenomena and intensifies the effects between such systems, making weather unpredictable, said Marcelo Schneider, a National Meteorology Institute (Inmet) researcher.\n\nELECTRICITY CUTS\n\nIn Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, downtown streets were under water after the Guaiba River breached its banks with record water levels.\n\nPorto Alegre residents faced empty supermarket shelves and closed gas stations, with shops rationing sales of mineral water. The city distributed water in trucks to hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe floods have also impacted water and electricity services, with more than 1.4 million affected overall, according to Civil Defense.\n\nAlmost half a million people were without power in Porto Alegre and outlying towns as electricity companies cut off supplies for security reasons in flooded neighborhoods. National grid operator ONS said five hydroelectric dams and transmission lines were shut down due to the heavy rains.\n\nThe city's airport, its apron under water, has suspended all flights since Friday.\n\nFuel shortages were reported as state-run oil company Petrobras said it was having trouble moving diesel from its refinery in badly-flooded Canoas within metropolitan Porto Alegre, a senior government official said.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on a government television program that the extent of the damage will not be known until the waters subside. He promised federal aid for the state in what is considered its worst ever climate disaster.\n\nJP Morgan economists projected that the impact of the floods on Brazil's economy would be a modest dent in GDP growth and a marginal increase in inflation, mainly due to higher prices for rice that is largely produced in Rio Grande do Sul. The government said Brazil will import rice to stabilize the market.\n\nBesides destroying critical infrastructure, the heavy rains and flooding have left grains fields under water and killed livestock, interrupting the soy harvest and halting work at multiple meat plants.\n\nThe Rio Grande port, a major port for grain exports, was operating normally, the state's port authority said. However, main access roads were impassable, disrupting grain deliveries to the port as trucks had to make a wide detour, exporters said.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news",

On Sunday evening, it had reported at least 78 deaths and 105 missing people.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul on Sunday with most of his cabinet, and said bureaucracy would not stop the government from reconstructing the state.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/11_03_2020_13_25_10_8590644.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

REUTERS/Diego Vara\n\nBy Amanda Perobelli and Leonardo Benansatto\n\nELDORADO DO SUL, Brazil (Reuters) -Rescuers rushed to evacuate people stranded by devastating floods across the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul on Tuesday, with at least 90 dead, thousands left homeless, and desperate survivors seeking food and basic supplies.\n\nOn the outskirts of Eldorado do Sul, 17 kilometers (10.5 miles) from the state capital of Porto Alegre, many people were sleeping on the roadside and told Reuters they were going hungry. Entire families were leaving on foot, carrying belongings in backpacks and shopping carts.\n\n\"We've been without food for three days and we've only just got this blanket. I'm with people I don't even know, I don't know where my family is,\" said a young man who gave his name as Ricardo Junior.\n\nThe flooding has hampered rescue efforts, with dozens of people still waiting to be evacuated by boat or helicopter from stricken homes. Small boats crisscrossed the flooded town searching for survivors.\n\nThe state's Civil Defense agency said the death toll had risen to 90 with another four deaths being investigated, while 131 people were still unaccounted for and 155,000 homeless.\n\nThe heavy rains that began last week have caused rivers to flood, inundating whole towns and destroying roads and bridges.\n\nRain is forecast to let up on Thursday but then continue through the weekend.\n\nClimate experts attributed the extreme rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul to the confluence of a heatwave caused by this year's El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific and brings rain to southern Brazil; a weaker cold front with rain and gales coming from the Antarctic; and unusual warmth in the Atlantic also raising humidity.\n\nGlobal warming exacerbates these phenomena and intensifies the effects between such systems, making weather unpredictable, said Marcelo Schneider, a National Meteorology Institute (Inmet) researcher.\n\nELECTRICITY CUTS\n\nIn Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, downtown streets were under water after the Guaiba River breached its banks with record water levels.\n\nPorto Alegre residents faced empty supermarket shelves and closed gas stations, with shops rationing sales of mineral water. The city distributed water in trucks to hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe floods have also impacted water and electricity services, with more than 1.4 million affected overall, according to Civil Defense.\n\nAlmost half a million people were without power in Porto Alegre and outlying towns as electricity companies cut off supplies for security reasons in flooded neighborhoods. National grid operator ONS said five hydroelectric dams and transmission lines were shut down due to the heavy rains.\n\nThe city's airport, its apron under water, has suspended all flights since Friday.\n\nFuel shortages were reported as state-run oil company Petrobras said it was having trouble moving diesel from its refinery in badly-flooded Canoas within metropolitan Porto Alegre, a senior government official said.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on a government television program that the extent of the damage will not be known until the waters subside. He promised federal aid for the state in what is considered its worst ever climate disaster.\n\nJP Morgan economists projected that the impact of the floods on Brazil's economy would be a modest dent in GDP growth and a marginal increase in inflation, mainly due to higher prices for rice that is largely produced in Rio Grande do Sul. The government said Brazil will import rice to stabilize the market.\n\nBesides destroying critical infrastructure, the heavy rains and flooding have left grains fields under water and killed livestock, interrupting the soy harvest and halting work at multiple meat plants.\n\nThe Rio Grande port, a major port for grain exports, was operating normally, the state's port authority said. However, main access roads were impassable, disrupting grain deliveries to the port as trucks had to make a wide detour, exporters said.\n\n(Reporting by Amanda Perobelli and Leonardo Benansatto in Eldorado do Sul, Leticia Fucuchima, Ana Mano and Roberto Samora in Sao Paulo, Marcela Ayres in Brasilia and Debora Ely in Porto Alegre; Writing by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Helicopters flew continually over the cities as stranded families with children awaited rescue on the rooftops.\n\nOne woman said she had never seen anything like it. \"It felt like a horror movie,\" Isolete Neumann told the Associated Press earlier this week. \"People were making barricades in front of hospitals with sand and gravel.\"\n\nBrazil's president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, travelled to the state on Thursday to meet local authorities and express his solidarity.\n\nOne day later he described the floods as being among the largest Brazil had ever seen. \"Never before in the history of Brazil had there been such a quantity of rain in one single location,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe flooding across the state has surpassed that seen during a deluge in 1941, according to the Brazilian Geological Service. In some cities, water levels were at their highest since record-keeping began almost 150 years ago, the agency added.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul's capital, the Gua\u00edba River broke its banks, flooding streets. Porto Alegre's international airport has suspended all flights for an indefinite period.\n\nRains were expected to continue in the northern and north-eastern regions of the state, but the volume of precipitation has been declining, and should remain below the levels seen in recent days, according to the state meteorology authority. Earlier in the week, some areas saw as much as 150mm (6in) of rainfall within 24 hours.\n\n\"River water levels should stay high for some days,\" the state governor, Eduardo Leite, said on Saturday on social media, adding that it was difficult to determine exactly how long the situation would continue.\n\nEarlier in the week Leite had described the floods as a \"critical moment\" for the state. \"The current event will be the worst climate disaster that our state ever faced,\" he wrote on social media on Wednesday.\n\nThe state of Rio Grande do Sul sits at a geographical meeting point between tropical and polar atmospheres, giving rise to a weather pattern that includes periods of intense rain and drought. Local scientists say the pattern has been intensifying as a result of the human-made climate crisis.\n\nIn September, Rio Grande do Sul was hit by an extratropical cyclone, leading to flooding that killed more than 50 people. The cyclone came after more than two years of persistent drought, during which the region saw only scarce showers.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

Authorities are also investigating if another four deaths were storm-related.\n\nThe catastrophic flooding caused by days of heavy storms has impacted over two-thirds of the nearly 500 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul, which borders Uruguay and Argentina. Roads, bridges, homes, and other infrastructure have been destroyed or submerged across wide swaths of the state.\n\nIn Porto Alegre's capital, floodwaters from the overflowing Guaiba River inundated entire neighbourhoods after reaching the highest level on record. The city's international airport has remained closed since Friday due to the inundation.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, over 400,000 residents lack power, and nearly a third lack water access. Rescue teams around Brazil have joined local volunteers in frantic efforts to reach stranded survivors. Many have used boats, jet skis, and even swimming to pluck people from rooftops and upper floors.\n\n\"The only thing we hear when we enter a street is 'help, help',\" said Fabiano Saldanha, part of a group that has used jet skis to save about 50 people in Porto Alegre since Friday.\n\nKaeli Moraes recounted being rescued with her family just as the waters were nearing the second floor of their home. \"There was flooding in September, then in November, and now this one. It is only getting worse,\" she said from a makeshift shelter.\n\nIn Canoas, near Porto Alegre, 76-year-old Julio Manichesque was pulled from the rooftop of his home of 52 years by volunteers after being stranded since Friday. \"I have never seen that much water,\" he said.\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, Pope Francis offered prayers for the people of Rio Grande do Sul during his weekly Vatican address on Sunday. Authorities warn the death toll could still rise substantially in the wake of the region's worst flooding disaster in recent memory.", "source": {"uri": "hwnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "HW News English"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zaina_afzal_kutty@hwnews.in", "name": "Zaina Afzal Kutty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regions of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_watercraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal watercraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu\u00eds_Fabiano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lu\u00eds Fabiano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://hwnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wesbite-Thumbnail-2024-05-06T153039.876.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Many of the 8,000 indigenous people directly impacted have lost their homes and all their possessions. Such reserves of food they had have run out. Particularly badly affected have been those living in the state capital, Porto Alegre.\n\nStarting on April 29, the latest floods followed just one month after the previous spate of heavy rain, the source reports.\n\nClose to 90 -- or 80% -- of the state's municipalities have reported flooding, according to the same source earlier this week. The confirmed death toll at that time was 90, with more than 130 people still missing.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has announced the release of emergency federal government funding for Rio Grande do Sul. After this initial \"first-aid\" funding, he committed to further support after discussion with the state's governor, reported Ag\u00eancia Brasil.\n\nTen poultry and pig farms in Rio Grande do Sul were known to have completely or partially suspended production due to the effects of flooding, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein, ABPA. Some of the premises were rendered completely out of action, while others were facing extreme operational challenges due to difficulties linked to the transport of the workforce, inputs, and animals. For many more, water, electricity and communication systems have failed.\n\nFor ABPA, the first priorities were to save lives and provide essential supplies for those who have lost their livelihoods -- followed by providing feed and care to the flood-affected poultry and swine. With the impacts spread so widely across the state, ABPA expressed concerns about the food supply to the population of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThe state accounts for around 20% of Brazil's total pork production, and 11% of its poultry meat. According to ABPA, residents could have to wait at least 30 days for normal production to resume.", "source": {"uri": "wattagnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WATTAgNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag\u00eancia_Brasil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ag\u00eancia Brasil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://img.wattagnet.com/files/base/wattglobalmedia/all/image/2024/05/brazil_map.663cd12454589.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549109", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 814, "textEnd": 822}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Entire families were leaving on foot, carrying belongings in backpacks and shopping carts.\n\n\"We've been without food for three days and we've only just got this blanket. I'm with people I don't even know, I don't know where my family is,\" said a young man who gave his name as Ricardo Junior.\n\nThe flooding has hampered rescue efforts, with dozens of people still waiting to be evacuated by boat or helicopter from stricken homes. Small boats crisscrossed the flooded town searching for survivors.\n\nThe state's Civil Defense agency said the death toll had risen to 90 with another four deaths being investigated, while 131 people were still unaccounted for and 155,000 homeless.\n\nThe heavy rains that began last week have caused rivers to flood, inundating whole towns and destroying roads and bridges.\n\nRain is forecast to let up on Thursday but then continue through the weekend.\n\nClimate experts attributed the extreme rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul to the confluence of a heatwave caused by this year's El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific and brings rain to southern Brazil; a weaker cold front with rain and gales coming from the Antarctic; and unusual warmth in the Atlantic also raising humidity.\n\nGlobal warming exacerbates these phenomena and intensifies the effects between such systems, making weather unpredictable, said Marcelo Schneider, a National Meteorology Institute (Inmet) researcher.\n\nELECTRICITY CUTS\n\nIn Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, downtown streets were under water after the Guaiba River breached its banks with record water levels.\n\nPorto Alegre residents faced empty supermarket shelves and closed gas stations, with shops rationing sales of mineral water. The city distributed water in trucks to hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe floods have also impacted water and electricity services, with more than 1.4 million affected overall, according to Civil Defense.\n\nAlmost half a million people were without power in Porto Alegre and outlying towns as electricity companies cut off supplies for security reasons in flooded neighborhoods. National grid operator ONS said five hydroelectric dams and transmission lines were shut down due to the heavy rains.\n\nThe city's airport, its apron under water, has suspended all flights since Friday.\n\nFuel shortages were reported as state-run oil company Petrobras said it was having trouble moving diesel from its refinery in badly-flooded Canoas within metropolitan Porto Alegre, a senior government official said.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on a government television program that the extent of the damage will not be known until the waters subside. He promised federal aid for the state in what is considered its worst ever climate disaster.\n\nJP Morgan economists projected that the impact of the floods on Brazil's economy would be a modest dent in GDP growth and a marginal increase in inflation, mainly due to higher prices for rice that is largely produced in Rio Grande do Sul. The government said Brazil will import rice to stabilize the market.\n\nBesides destroying critical infrastructure, the heavy rains and flooding have left grains fields under water and killed livestock, interrupting the soy harvest and halting work at multiple meat plants.\n\nThe Rio Grande port, a major port for grain exports, was operating normally, the state's port authority said. However, main access roads were impassable, disrupting grain deliveries to the port as trucks had to make a wide detour, exporters said.

The animal was secured by firemen and loaded into a Zodiac inflatable boat to take it to safety.\n\nThe floods have destroyed infrastructure and bridges, blocking access to Porto Alegre, where supermarket shelves are empty and looting has been reported at night.\n\nGovernor Eduardo Leite said initial calculations indicate that Rio Grande do Sul will need at least 19 billion reais ($3.68 billion) to rebuild from the damage, which has extended into farm areas around the capital.\n\n\"The effect of the floods and the extent of the tragedy are devastating,\" he said on social media.\n\nIn Brasilia, the federal government estimated the fiscal impact of the flooding at 7.7 billion reais ($1.49 billion), mostly due to the injection of funds into a support program for small businesses hit by the floods.\n\n\"This doesn't end here,\" President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said at an event announcing steps to help the stricken state.

Jose Carlos Sallet, subcommander of Rio Grande do Sul Military Firefighters, said that approximately 1,000 firefighters are working on rescue missions, reported CNN.\n\n\"When the rain stops, they have been doing short operations to save as many people as possible. Yesterday (Saturday) were we able to intensify operations,\" Sallet said.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday, accompanied by Defence Minister Jose Mucio, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva, among others, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nThe leader and his team surveyed the flooded streets of the state capital, Porto Alegre, from a helicopter.\n\nMoreover, some of the images showed muddy brown waters rising as high as rooftops in some areas, while rescue teams were out with inflatable rafts, taking people and pets on board.\n\nGovernor Eduardo Leite declared a state of emergency as the region grapples with the aftermath of the catastrophic weather event.\n\n\"We are dealing with the worst disaster in [our] history,\" Governor Leite lamented, acknowledging the grim reality that the death toll is expected to rise further as rescue efforts continue.\n\nIn recent years, Rio Grande do Sul has been increasingly hit by extreme weather events and at least 54 people died in the state in September after it endured a sub-tropical cyclone, according to CNN.\n\nThe climate crisis, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is supercharging extreme weather globally, making many events more intense and more frequent.

There is no other way,\" 30-year-old resident Luan Pas told AFP next to a street turned into a stagnant, smelly river.\n\nOperations at the port of Porto Alegre have been suspended, and its international airport indefinitely closed.\n\nThe Air Force said the military base outside town will receive commercial flights transporting aid and passengers.\n\nIn a rare dry spot in Porto Alegre's historic center, dozens of people gathered around a generator rented by a pharmacy to charge their cell phones.\n\n\"This is a parallel universe,\" said one of them, university professor Daniela da Silva, 30.\n\nThe Inmet meteorological institute has warned of more storms with heavy rains and winds in the south of the state and downpours over the weekend in the Porto Alegre region.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization in a report Wednesday, said Latin American and the Caribbean had recorded its warmest year on record in 2023 -- \"a year of record climatic hazards\" for the region due to climate change and the El Nino weather phenomenon.\n\nMany towns and cities in Brazil, it said, were hit by \"exceptional rainfall\" that caused displacement and massive upheavals.\n\nDue to climate

It also said it was investigating whether another four deaths were related to the storms.\n\nFlooding from storms in the past few days has affected more than two thirds of the nearly 500 cities in the state, which borders Uruguay and Argentina, leaving more than 115,000 people displaced, according to authorities.\n\nFloods have destroyed roads and bridges in several cities. The rains also triggered landslides and the partial collapse of a dam at a small hydroelectric power plant.\n\nMore than 400,000 people were without power on Sunday evening, while nearly a third of the state's population was without water, authorities said.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, the state capital, the Guaiba lake breached its banks, hitting the highest water level on records, according to the national geological service.

At least 75 have died and 103 are missing, according to the latest official report. Several neighborhoods of Porto Alegre, the most populated city in the region, are under water while its international airport announced on Firday night it would close for an undetermined amount of time.\n\nCompanies that had announced they were suspending activities due to the heavy rains are now announcing they will resume their normal work on Monday.\n\nLanding in Rio Grande do Sul for the second time this week, President Lula was to met with state Governor Eduardo Leite, according to social media posts. Leite is calling for federal aid to rebuild the infrastructure of his region, saying the effort needed compares to the billions of dollars spent by the US government after World War II.\n\nPresident Lula toured the flooded areas and held a press conference surrounded by several members of his cabinet, including Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Chief of Staff Rui Costa, along with leaders of congress and members of the country's justice courts.\n\n\"This is a very important state in Brazil,\" said Lula, who pledged federal aid to rebuild roads. Rio Grande do Sul is one of the key states for agriculture, a main driver for the country's better than expected economic performance last year. \"It's time for Brazil to give back and help Rio Grande do Sul,\" he said.\n\nThis is the fourth wave of extreme weather Rio Grande do Sul has faced in less than a year. Experts say the floods are the worst in 80 years, surpassing those of 1941, when rains continued for more than 30 straight days. Some municipalities are facing heavier rains than last September, when 54 died people and damage spread across 40 cities along the Taquari River.\n\n(Updates with details from presser starting in fifth graph)", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taquari_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taquari River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Costa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rui Costa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Haddad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Haddad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/S.xbWmsM0iHS8RCnMtfsSg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/67d6c3b651c90104140f8ac6d1cdf220", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The animal was secured by firemen and loaded into a Zodiac inflatable boat to take it to safety.\n\nThe floods have destroyed infrastructure and bridges, blocking access to Porto Alegre, where supermarket shelves are empty and looting has been reported at night.\n\nGovernor Eduardo Leite said initial calculations indicate that Rio Grande do Sul will need at least 19 billion reais ($3.68 billion) to rebuild from the damage, which has extended into farm areas around the capital.\n\n\"The effect of the floods and the extent of the tragedy are devastating,\" he said on social media.\n\nIn Brasilia, the federal government estimated the fiscal impact of the flooding at 7.7 billion reais ($1.49 billion), mostly due to the injection of funds into a support program for small businesses hit by the floods.\n\n\"This doesn't end here,\" President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said at an event announcing steps to help the stricken state. Lula said the full extent of Rio Grande do Sul's needs would be known only when the water recedes.

You can't even see its roof now.\"\n\nLike Jorge, the yoga teacher, residents in Rio Grande do Sul who are able to flee are doing so, amid fears of shortage and disease. However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nClose to the airport, about 100 people of a nearby slum set up tents on the road, hoping to return to their shacks on small boats to try to save some of their belongings. Some roasted chunks of meat on improvised grills.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall could exceed 150 millimetres (nearly six inches) by early Wednesday.\n\nLate Monday, Rio Grande do Sul Gov. Eduardo Leite issued an alert for several cities close to the huge Patos Lagoon. The floodwaters in Porto Alegre and other cities pass through the lagoon to the sea.\n\n\"The water level will rise and it will affect you,\" he said in a video broadcast on his social media channels. \"Please, believe the alerts and help us save lives. Let's reduce the damage so we can be together to rebuild.\"\n\nPorto Alegre's metropolitan region is one of Brazil's largest, home to around four million people.\n\nDamage from the rains has already forced more than 150,000 people from their homes. An additional 50,000 have taken refuge in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Rio Grande do Sul for a second time on Sunday, accompanied by Defense Minister Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad and Environment Minister Marina Silva, among others.\n\nAuthorities said Monday that they are concerned about the risks of hypothermia, as the temperature should drop to 10 C on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Melo issued a plea for more donations of blankets.\n\nAnd it isn't just residents who are at risk.\n\n\"Our personnel has been wet for five days, shivering in the cold, staying up all night, in deficient sanitary conditions, because we're sharing the same facilities with the displaced,\" Gen. Hertz Pires do Nascimento, the army commander of Brazil's southern region, told journalists.\n\nDuring Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Francis said he was praying for the state's population.\n\nSecurity is another concern. Rio Grande do Sul's public security secretariat said in a statement that police will beef up operations to prevent looting and theft. Brazil's national guard is mobilizing to reinforce security.\n\n\"Even a boat was stolen this morning from the people working on the rescue. Jet Skis and houses were looted. This is deplorable and must be denounced,\" Paulo Pimenta, Lula's spokesperson, said Tuesday at a news conference.\n\nThe flood disaster is also likely to affect the South American country's food supplies. Rio Grande do Sul produces 70 per cent of a basic Brazilian foodstuff: rice.\n\n\"With the rains, I think we've definitely delayed the harvest in Rio Grande do Sul. So, if needed to balance production, we'll have to import rice, import beans,\" Lula said in a radio interview at Brazil's public broadcaster.", "source": {"uri": "nationalobserver.com", "dataType":

The city has ordered water rationing.\n\nPorto Alegre's Salgado Filho International Airport, which usually sees between 120 and 140 flights daily, has been closed since May 3. There is \"no forecast of resumption of operations,\" according to the company that runs the airport.\n\nBecause the floodwaters haven't yet subsided, it's impossible to assess the full impact of the flooding and the funds that will be needed for recovery and rebuilding, said Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has visited the state with members of his cabinet.\n\n\"The initial difficulty is that no mayor, nor the [state's] governor, is aware of the damage that has been done,\" he said Tuesday. The situation will only become clear \"when the water goes down and we see what actually happened.\"\n\nEduardo Leite, governor of Rio Grande do Sul, warned on Tuesday evening that more danger lies ahead. A mass of cold air is expected to bring new storms, he said. Temperatures are likely to plummet and heavy rain will return to parts of the state later in the week.\n\n\"It isn't time to return home. The projection is that the rains can generate strong floods,\" Leite said at a press conference.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federative_units_of_Brazil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federative units of Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salgado_Filho_Porto_Alegre_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salgado Filho Porto Alegre International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Gua\u00edba", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Gua\u00edba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28847/2884782.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1165, "textEnd": 1170}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

We manage your personal data in accordance with our privacy policy.\n\nUnprecedented floods in Brazil's southern Rio Grande do Sul state are expected to create even more chaotic logistics situation in the country and could cut fertilizer usage for 2024-25 soybean crop in the state.\n\nHeavy rainfall has hit the state since 29 April, culminating in the worst floods ever registered in Rio Grande do Sul. The floods have reached the central part of the state, closing the ports of Pelotas and Porto Alegre, which both handle agricultural commodities, including grains, oilseeds and fertilizers. The high waters are expected to move south, reaching Rio Grande port.\n\nThe three Rio Grande do Sul ports handled about 44.8mn metric tonnes (t) in 2023, with the larger Rio Grande port accounting for at least 42.6mn t, according to port data.\n\nThe state's geographic layout and a particularly narrow channel for floodwaters to reach the sea suggests the worst is yet to come in the southern part of the state. Water levels are about to increase in the Lagoa dos Patos, a lagoon that receives water from many rivers and flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nBut operations are running normally in the Rio Grande port as of 9 May. The national association of cereal exporters Anec project that 343,250 t of soybeans and 131,778 t of soymeal will be shipped in the week ended 11 May, according to port schedule data. Shipments between 28 April and 4 May -- which account for the days where rainfall reached its peak and the state began to flood -- totaled 183,559t and 133,424t for soybean and soymeal, respectively.\n\nLineup data from maritime agency Williams predicts that soybean exports may total 838,600t, nearly doubling the volumes from the forecast a week ago. The estimated average waiting time for shipping rose to just three days from the two days projected on 29 April. The Rio Grande port was the fifth largest soybean exporter in 2023, with 3.8mn t shipped last year, according to the National Waterway Transportation Agency (Antaq).\n\nWaiting time for discharge fertilizers is at around one day, unchanged from the previous week. Rio Grande port was third in terms of fertilizer import volumes in the first quarter 2024, according to lineup data from maritime agency Unimar. Paranagua, in Parana state, received 2mn t of fertilizers, followed by Santos port and Rio Grande, with 1.9mn t and 990,640t, respectively.\n\nLineup data for May and June suggest that Rio Grande is about to receive 540,900t and 66,375t of fertilizers, respectively. Vessels lined-up for Rio Grande may be diverted to other ports, specially for Sao Francisco do Sul, in Santa Catarina state, and Paranagua according to market participants.\n\nEven if fertilizer volumes would be discharged as initially planned, the flow to agriculture producing areas would be compromised. The main access to the port, the BR-116 roadway, is already partially blocked, hampering truck flows in the state.\n\nDrivers have already been searching for short-stretches to move goods, as long-stretches force them to look for longer alternatives, considering there are around 88 partial and full road blockages in the state as of 9 May.\n\nLogistics company Rumo also partially interrupted operations in Rio Grande do Sul state on 6 May. The company has a grain terminal in Rio Grande port and a rail network of around 7,220km in Brazil's South region, which includes Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana states.\n\nFertilizer companies that operate in Rio Grande do Sul are reportedly trying to move their product to warehouses away from the rivers. Considering the agricultural production, volumes that had already been sowed and were in silos are now soaked. With more damage expected to be measured farmers in Rio Grande do Sul may be discouraged from investing in technology and fertilizers for the upcoming 2024-25 soybean crop.\n\nBrazil's national meteorological institute Inmet expects rainfall to intensify once again in Rio Grande do Sul starting this Friday between the state's center-north and west portions.\n\nRain levels are expected to subside by 12 May, but may surpass 100mm before then.\n\nThe coastal areas in the north regions and south of Santa Catarina state are also expected to be affected, according to Inmet.", "source":

Governor Eduardo Leite confirmed that 131 people were missing and at least 401 towns (out of 497 statewide) had been affected.\n\nWhile 48,799 people have been welcomed in shelters, 159,036 victims have been displaced and housed elsewhere. According to the IBGE's 2022 census, Rio Grande do Sul has 10.8 million inhabitants,\n\n\"The size of the crisis in Rio Grande do Sul is what makes this situation particularly difficult for us to deal with. Practically the whole state is affected in some way,\" lamented Leite, who described the situation as a \"catastrophe\".\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, he also said that the numbers were rising every day but the data may be \"inaccurate\".\n\nTemperatures are forecast to drop from Wednesday and Thursday with heavy rain expected in the southern part of the state. \"There is an initial projection that, between Friday and Sunday, we will again have very heavy rain in the northern half of the state, affecting the rivers that have already risen and caused all this damage,\" Leite also said while urging people not to return to their homes yet, as there is still a risk of further flooding.\n\nIn this scenario, Brazil's Football Confederation (CBF) postponed all matches of men's and women's teams until May 27 \"due to the state of public calamity in Rio Grande do Sul, decreed by the federal and state governments, as a result of the extreme weather events that have occurred,\" the entity announced through a statement.\n\n\"The CBF, as the organizer of national competitions, and attentive to its institutional functions, as well as the humanitarian effort that the moment calls for, reaffirms its unrestricted support for the authorities so that all measures and actions are adopted for the benefit of the population of Rio Grande do Sul, whose relief is the top priority,\" the communiqu\u00e9 went on.\n\nThe measure comes a day after the Gaucho Football Federation asked the CBF to suspend all matches involving clubs from the state of Rio Grande do Sul for 20 days.\n\nGames involving Rio Grande do Sul teams had already been suspended on previous weekends but, since then, floods have engulfed several cities in the Porto Alegre metropolitan area, culminating in the closure of Salgado Filho Airport for at least a month due to the flooding of the area.\n\nSouth America's Football Confederation (Conmebol) also agreed to postpone away matches featuring Porto Alegre's Gr\u00eamio and Internacional.\n\nMeanwhile, rural producers in the state said houses, sheds, and corrals had been destroyed, in addition to plantations flooded and crops lost as chickens, pigs, and cows were swept away by the waters, resulting in a \"sad and heartbreaking\" reality for small farmers, settlers, and quilombolas.", "source": {"uri": "en.mercopress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

We have children,\" said 27-year-old Gabriela Almeida, queuing at a public tap with a one-year-old in her arms.\n\nIndividuals and businesses with wells were doing what they could to help.\n\nAlvorada

15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were hard at work in planes and boats, even jet skis, to rescue those who are trapped and bring aid where they can.\n\nBrazil's neighbors Uruguay and Argentina have sent rescue equipment and trained personnel.\n\nAs the calamity showed no signs of abating, weather forecasts suggested it could still get worse.\n\nThe Inmet meteorological institute warned of possible storms in the south of Rio Grande do Sul until Wednesday, followed by rainfall in the center and north it said would imperil the rescue effort.\n\nThe state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, remained at historic levels Tuesday.\n\nAccording to weather agency MetSul, the flooding has \"changed the map of the metropolitan region\" of Porto Alegre.\n\nPolice, meanwhile, said there have been reports of evacuated homes being looted and some residents, afraid of such intrusions, were refusing to move to shelters.\n\nmls/app/nn/mlr/dw\n\nMore from this section\n\nMCT Reports A 2% Lock Volume Increase Despite Rising Rates IMG Travel Protection Plans Are Now Available Through TravelInsurance.com

REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (Reuters) -Authorities interrupted rescue efforts in flood-ravaged southern Brazil on Wednesday amid more rain and the risk of lightning and stiff winds that threaten to exacerbate a catastrophe that has already killed at least 100 people and left over 163,000 seeking shelter.\n\nThe floods that began last week, caused by unusually heavy rains, have destroyed highways and bridges in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which borders Uruguay and Argentina.\n\n\"We've lost everything,\" said Adriana Freitas in state capital Porto Alegre, where the Guaiba River burst its banks and inundated city streets. \"It's sad when we see the city, our house, in the middle of the water. It seems like it's over, that the world has ended.\"\n\nAt least 128 people are still missing, the state's civil defense authority said, urging people living close to the Patos lagoon south of Porto Alegre to leave their homes immediately.\n\nArmy soldiers used amphibious armored cars to rescue people from flooding in Canoas, just north of the city, where the waters have reached a depth of some three meters (10 ft) and the streets can only be navigated by boat.\n\nA Reuters journalist saw one team of local volunteer rescuers find about 20 dogs stranded on the second floor of an abandoned factory, offering food to those too fierce to take aboard.\n\nPorto Alegre city hall warned such civilian rescuers on Wednesday afternoon to halt their operations, given the forecast for rain, lightning storms and winds exceeding 80 km per hour (50 mph).\n\nIn the Porto Alegre suburb of Eldorado do Sul, tractor driver Daniel Farias said he had spent days ferrying survivors to safety, carrying whole families out on his wheel loader, including pets.\n\n\"I have been living in this tractor with my children, to survive this calamity. We believe it will pass,\" an exhausted Farias told Reuters. He said he had slept little and eaten less.\n\nRISK OF MORE FLOODS\n\nBrazil's national center for natural disasters warned that the southern area of Rio Grande do Sul state was under \"high risk\" of more flooding, with rainfall expected to restart after a brief hiatus.\n\nWeather forecaster MetSul said in a statement the region could face more \"very large\" floods \"of serious proportions\".\n\nIn neighboring Uruguay, storms and flooding have closed highways and left nearly 800 people displaced and over 3,000 people without power, the government said.\n\nIn Brazil, many residents in and around Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million people, have been living in darkness after power companies cut off electricity for security reasons.\n\nThey have faced shortages of products, especially drinking water. Supermarket managers said there was no access for supply trucks or employees trying to get to work. Mineral water sales were restricted in some supermarkets.\n\nVolunteer rescue operations after dark in Porto Alegre were also hampered by looting, with police providing security using boats and even jet skis.\n\n\"We are not going out to rescue people at night without an armed escort, because it has become too risky,\" volunteer Lauro Strogulski told Reuters.\n\n(Reporting by Leonardo Benassatto

It has already rained 200 mm [8 inches] in some areas and projections indicate much more water coming. 2023 scenes of flooded cities will be repeated.\"\n\nTwo days later, they began to post about overflowing creeks, rising river levels, and flooding while The National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) put the entire state under alert, showing a varying scale from yellow to red, the latter being the larger portion. On April 30, the local government confirmed eight dead and 21 people disappeared.\n\nEver since the publication of this story on May 7, the worst natural disaster in the history of Rio Grande do Sul has registered 100 dead, 128 disappeared, and over 1.4 million people affected. Sums that seem still underreported when one sees the images of entire cities underwater.\n\nAmong the 497 cities in the state, 414 were hit so far. And, as you read it, there is a chance people are still waiting on roofs for rescue, trapped in houses and buildings surrounded by water. Others are still looking for victims of landslides; and many are without access to clean water, power, or ways of coming and going from their cities, with bridges missing and roads destroyed. The rain is moving south and is forecasted to return to other cities already impacted.\n\nIn September 2023, after the worst climate disaster Rio Grande do Sul had registered at the time, re-elected governor Eduardo Leite (PSDB, Social Democracy Party) said in an interview for Globo News TV channel that \"math models couldn't foresee the volume of rains.\" This time, there isn't any surprise.\n\nAn expert quoted by Deutsch Welle says the state became a target now because of an overlay of weather phenomenons, like recent heat waves and the influence of El Ni\u00f1o. Although Marcelo Seluchi, coordinator of Cemaden (National Center of Monitoring and Alert for Natural Disasters), says no place in the world would be able to resist this situation, \"there could have been contingency and prevention plans.\" \"You can't do it from one week to the other. This is something missing,\" he said.\n\nThe first cities hit by the local catastrophe that swallowed Rio Grande do Sul registered landslides, bridges destroyed and floods that covered cities and highways, making help even more difficult to arrive.\n\nIn the state capital, Porto Alegre, the Gua\u00edba River surpassed an 83-year historic markwhen it reached 4.77 meters of elevation. It has reached 5.3 meters now -- its system limit to cause a flood is 3 meters. Neighborhoods that had never registered floods had to be evacuated, but many residents remained isolated in their homes. Over 85 percent of the population had no access to clean water, even in supermarkets, and the airport is still under water, with flights estimated to be suspended till the end of the month. Nonada, a Global Voices' partner, had to cease publishing for a few days.\n\nWhile the world, the rest of Brazil and 1.6 million people on the ground watched Madonna's free concert in Rio de Janeiro, on May 4, on social media, people shared addresses with calls for rescue and help in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre, videos of volunteers working and alarming rumors about corpses and violence.\n\nWith the high demand for assistance, besides police and the armed forces, many volunteers joined the front amidst the emergency.\n\nGr\u00eamio and Internacional, the two traditional football teams and rivals from Porto Alegre, had their stadiums invaded by waters. While both clubs are trying to stop the national competitions they're playing, footballers from both teams have been helping with rescues and volunteering in donation centres and shelters.\n\nInfluencers outside of Rio Grande do Sul also joined massive donation campaigns and actions. A Brazilian surfer, Pedro Scooby, gathered friends and travelled by road with jet skies to support the ongoing rescues, digital influencer Felipe Neto managed to rent and arrange trucks to carry drinkable water from a water park to the cities affected, humorist Whinderson Nunes rented aircraft and organized food donations.\n\nStill, reports of financial scams using the floods, politicians and influencers spreading fake news and attempts of robbery and attacks on houses are increasing.\n\nJournalist Isabela Reis crossed news and posts in a thread trying to understand the timeline until the explosion of the climate disaster, calling out the state government for \"neglect and inoperability.\" Many on social media complain of people \"trying to politicize the tragedy,\" while others emphasize politics has everything to do with it.\n\nTo BBC Brazil, executive-secretary to the Climate Watch (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima), Marcio Astrini, said \"The tragedy is also a responsibility of senators and members of the congress who disassemble the environmental legislation,\" and stated:\n\n\"Every year the government of Rio Grande do Sul gets extremely flabbergasted that rains are intense. The government of Rio de Janeiro gets surprised when it happens in Petr\u00f3polis. It's a surprise in S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo, in northern Minas Gerais, in Recife (Pernambuco), in the south of Bahia. It happens that it has been nine consecutive years with temperature averages as the hottest ones ever recorded. There is no surprise anymore. We need to brace ourselves for that.\"\n\nEduardo Leite, the state governor, defended himself from critics, saying \"this is not the time to look for culprits.\" People questioned the state's preparation to mitigate the consequences of the current rains and floods or the aftermath to help out victims. During his two terms, Leite altered points in the environmental legislation, made rules to install dams in environmental preservation areas more flexible, and reduced the 2024 budget destined for the Civil Defense, compared to 2023.\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's government (PT, Workers' Party) installed a crisis cabinet in the state and recognized calamity status for several cities, which could make a budget increase more accessible and unlimited.\n\nEnvironment Minister Marina Silva was among the ministers who traveled with Lula to Rio Grande do Sul. In an interview with CNN Brazil, she talked about the idea of a climate emergency decree for 1,942 cities in Brazil that are susceptible to extreme climate occurrences. Marina explained:\n\n\"When decreeing a climate emergency, you can have continuous actions, sometimes of removing the population, draining, building support, a proper infrastructure, alert systems that can be fast, combining technology with relation and community integration.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

And more rain is on the way, complicating recovery efforts.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, 95 people had died, 131 were missing and 159,000 had been displaced, the state government said, while 1.5 million residents have been impacted in some way by the disaster.\n\nMany roads around the state are impassable, hampering access to smaller towns and cities. Authorities are using aircraft to distribute food and medical supplies.\n\nWater utility Corsan said one-fifth of its millions of customers in Rio Grande do Sul are without running water. Power and phone and internet services are down in dozens of municipalities.\n\nPorto Alegre, the state's capital and its largest city, was swamped by the overflow of Lake Gua\u00edba, which surged to record levels more than 2 meters (about 6.6 feet) above its normal height. The city has ordered water rationing.\n\nPorto Alegre's Salgado Filho International Airport, which usually sees between 120 and 140 flights daily, has been closed since May 3. There is \"no forecast of resumption of operations,\" according to the company that runs the airport.\n\nBecause the floodwaters haven't yet subsided, it's impossible to assess the full impact of the flooding and the funds that will be needed for recovery and rebuilding, said Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has visited the state with members of his cabinet.\n\n\"The initial difficulty is that no mayor, nor the [state's] governor, is aware of the damage that has been done,\" he said Tuesday. The situation will only become clear \"when the water goes down and we see what actually happened.\"\n\nEduardo Leite, governor of Rio Grande do Sul, warned on Tuesday evening that more danger lies ahead. A mass of cold air is expected to bring new storms, he said. Temperatures are likely to plummet and heavy rain will return to parts of the state later in the week.\n\n\"It isn't time to return home. The projection is that the rains can generate strong floods,\" Leite said at a press conference.\n\nArmy General Hertz Pires do Nascimento said he is particularly concerned about the welfare of residents of Jaguar\u00e3o, Rio Grande and Pelotas municipalities, with more rain predicted, and that helicopter rescues may be necessary there.\n\nRio Grande do Sul is a rainy part of the world, and several factors likely contributed to the severity of the floods.\n\nThe recent intense rains resulted from an atmospheric blockage in the central region of Brazil and a mass of polar air that came from Argentina and Uruguay, in addition to the El Nin\u00f5 phenomenon, said Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agrometeorologist at Rural Clima, a forecasting company.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is what meteorologists call the occasional warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific that has global weather consequences. When those conditions are in place -- as they have been since last June -- southern and southwestern Brazil can see higher temperatures and more intense rainfall.\n\nBut the timing of this deluge was unusual, said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a science adviser to the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and a senior staff associate at Columbia University's climate school. El Ni\u00f1o is most likely to intensify storms in the region from September to January.\n\n\"In areas where we have rainfall every month, or let's say year-round, the El Ni\u00f1o teleconnection is a bit more complicated to unpack,\" he said.\n\nClimate change is also likely to have had some influence. The atmosphere has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. As air heats up, the amount of water vapor it can hold also rises, about 7% more water for every degree. That means higher rainfall in many places.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o was recently found to have contributed to low water levels in the Panama Canal and, in combination with climate change, to have worsened catastrophic flooding in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWhile El Ni\u00f1o and planetary warming are both central to understanding the flooding, \"first and foremost is climate change,\" said Michael McPhaden, a senior scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory.\n\n\"Humans are dumping more and more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere,\" McPhaden said. \"And this is leading to not only rising global temperatures, but also more extreme weather events, more extreme rainfalls, more extreme droughts.\"\n\nUntangling the major influences on the Rio Grande do Sul floods will take some time, as experts in climate attribution evaluate the disaster. Kruczkiewiecz said he'll be trying to better understand how much of the flooding in Porto Alegre came from urban rainfall, and how much from river flooding that occurred tens or hundreds of miles upstream.\n\n\"We're seeing more situations where we're having combined, different types of floods happening at the same time,\" he said. He called this \"an increasing concern,\" particularly for growing metropolitan areas such as greater Porto Alegre.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Leite said the state government is beginning to design a housing plan to shelter families who have lost everything. The state has asked the federal government to lend national security personnel and vehicles to address an outbreak of looting and other crimes.\n\nWhenever the immediate crisis dissipates, officials will also look back to see how emergency systems might be improved to minimize losses when rains come again.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [],

And more rain is on the way, complicating recovery efforts.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, 95 people had died, 131 were missing and 159,000 had been displaced, the state government said, while 1.5 million residents have been impacted in some way by the disaster.\n\nMany roads around the state are impassable, hampering access to smaller towns and cities. Authorities are using aircraft to distribute food and medical supplies.\n\nWater utility Corsan said one-fifth of its millions of customers in Rio Grande do Sul are without running water. Power and phone and internet services are down in dozens of municipalities.\n\nPorto Alegre, the state's capital and its largest city, was swamped by the overflow of Lake Gua\u00edba, which surged to record levels more than 2 meters (about 6.6 feet) above its normal height. The city has ordered water rationing.\n\nPorto Alegre's Salgado Filho International Airport, which usually sees between 120 and 140 flights daily, has been closed since May 3. There is \"no forecast of resumption of operations,\" according to the company that runs the airport.\n\nBecause the floodwaters haven't yet subsided, it's impossible to assess the full impact of the flooding and the funds that will be needed for recovery and rebuilding, said Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has visited the state with members of his cabinet.\n\n\"The initial difficulty is that no mayor, nor the [state's] governor, is aware of the damage that has been done,\" he said Tuesday. The situation will only become clear \"when the water goes down and we see what actually happened.\"\n\nEduardo Leite, governor of Rio Grande do Sul, warned on Tuesday evening that more danger lies ahead. A mass of cold air is expected to bring new storms, he said. Temperatures are likely to plummet and heavy rain will return to parts of the state later in the week.\n\n\"It isn't time to return home. The projection is that the rains can generate strong floods,\" Leite said at a press conference.\n\nArmy General Hertz Pires do Nascimento said he is particularly concerned about the welfare of residents of Jaguar\u00e3o, Rio Grande and Pelotas municipalities, with more rain predicted, and that helicopter rescues may be necessary there.\n\nRio Grande do Sul is a rainy part of the world, and several factors likely contributed to the severity of the floods.\n\nThe recent intense rains resulted from an atmospheric blockage in the central region of Brazil and a mass of polar air that came from Argentina and Uruguay, in addition to the El Nin\u00f5 phenomenon, said Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agrometeorologist at Rural Clima, a forecasting company.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is what meteorologists call the occasional warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific that has global weather consequences. When those conditions are in place - as they have been since last June - southern and southwestern Brazil can see higher temperatures and more intense rainfall.\n\nBut the timing of this deluge was unusual, said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a science adviser to the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and a senior staff associate at Columbia University's climate school. El Ni\u00f1o is most likely to intensify storms in the region from September to January.\n\n\"In areas where we have rainfall every month, or let's say year-round, the El Ni\u00f1o teleconnection is a bit more complicated to unpack,\" he said.\n\nClimate change is also likely to have had some influence. The atmosphere has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. As air heats up, the amount of water vapor it can hold also rises, about 7% more water for every degree. That means higher rainfall in many places.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o was recently found to have contributed to low water levels in the Panama Canal and, in combination with climate change, to have worsened catastrophic flooding in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWhile El Ni\u00f1o and planetary warming are both central to understanding the flooding, \"first and foremost is climate change,\" said Michael McPhaden, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory.\n\n\"Humans are dumping more and more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere,\" McPhaden said. \"And this is leading to not only rising global temperatures, but also more extreme weather events, more extreme rainfalls, more extreme droughts.\"\n\nUntangling the major influences on the Rio Grande do Sul floods will take some time, as experts in climate attribution evaluate the disaster. Kruczkiewiecz said he'll be trying to better understand how much of the flooding in Porto Alegre came from urban rainfall, and how much from river flooding that occurred tens or hundreds of miles upstream.\n\n\"We're seeing more situations where we're having combined, different types of floods happening at the same time,\" he said. He called this \"an increasing concern,\" particularly for growing metropolitan areas such as greater Porto Alegre.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Leite said the state government is beginning to design a housing plan to shelter families who have lost everything. The state has asked the federal government to lend national security personnel and vehicles to address an outbreak of looting and other crimes.\n\nWhenever the immediate crisis dissipates, officials will also look back to see how emergency systems might be improved to minimize losses when rains come again.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City

Small boats crisscrossed the flooded town searching for survivors.\n\nThe state's Civil Defense agency said the death toll had risen to 90 with another four deaths being investigated, while 131 people were still unaccounted for and 155,000 homeless.\n\nThe heavy rains that began last week have caused rivers to flood, inundating whole towns and destroying roads and bridges.\n\nRain is forecast to let up on Thursday but then continue through the weekend.\n\nClimate experts attributed the extreme rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul to the confluence of a heatwave caused by this year's El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific and brings rain to southern Brazil; a weaker cold front with rain and gales coming from the Antarctic; and unusual warmth in the Atlantic also raising humidity.\n\nGlobal warming exacerbates these phenomena and intensifies the effects between such systems, making weather unpredictable, said Marcelo Schneider, a National Meteorology Institute (Inmet) researcher.\n\nIn Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, downtown streets were under water after the Guaiba River breached its banks with record water levels.\n\nPorto Alegre residents faced empty supermarket shelves and closed gas stations, with shops rationing sales of mineral water. The city distributed water in trucks to hospitals and shelters.\n\nThe floods have also impacted water and electricity services, with more than 1.4 million affected overall, according to Civil Defense.\n\nAlmost half a million people were without power in Porto Alegre and outlying towns as electricity companies cut off supplies for security reasons in flooded neighborhoods. National grid operator ONS said five hydroelectric dams and transmission lines were shut down due to the heavy rains.\n\nThe city's airport, its apron under water, has suspended all flights since Friday.\n\nFuel shortages were reported as state-run oil company Petrobras said it was having trouble moving diesel from its refinery in badly-flooded Canoas within metropolitan Porto Alegre, a senior government official said.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on a government television program that the extent of the damage will not be known until the waters subside. He promised federal aid for the state in what is considered its worst ever climate disaster.\n\nJP Morgan economists projected that the impact of the floods on Brazil's economy would be a modest dent in GDP growth and a marginal increase in inflation, mainly due to higher prices for rice that is largely produced in Rio Grande do Sul. The government said Brazil will import rice to stabilize the market.\n\nBesides destroying critical infrastructure, the heavy rains and flooding have left grains fields under water and killed livestock, interrupting the soy harvest and halting work at multiple meat plants.\n\nThe Rio Grande port, a major port for grain exports, was operating normally, the state's port authority said. However, main access roads were impassable, disrupting grain deliveries to the port as trucks had to make a wide detour, exporters said.\n\n(Reporting by Amanda Perobelli and Leonardo Benansatto in

Credit: Carlos Macedo/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe natural disaster has destroyed homes, roads and bridges, with muddy brown water rising as high as rooftops in some areas.\n\nMore than 250 people are injured and at least 111 have been reported as missing, according to the state's civil defence unit, so the death toll could rise.\n\n'Never before in the history of Brazil has there been such a quantity of rain in one single location,' President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said.\n\nThis year, the impacts of the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon have been particularly severe in South America, exacerbating the problems caused by climate change.\n\nSome vineyards are completely submerged in water, and rescuers are wading through waist-deep water in a bid to save families across the state.\n\nLocal authorities reported that more than 80,000 people have been displaced as a result of the record-breaking floods.\n\nIsolete Neumann, who lives in the city of Lajeado, told the Associated Press: 'People were making barricades in front of hospitals with sand and gravel. It felt like a horror movie.'\n\nRio Grande do Sul is Brazil's largest wine-producing state, accounting for approximately 90% of total production. The state is at the southern tip of the country, bordering Uruguay and Argentina.\n\nVideos on social media highlight the devastating impact of the floods in Serra Ga\u00facha, which has faced river overflows and landslides. Others show city streets transformed into rivers in Nova Prata, a municipality in the heart of the Serra Ga\u00facha region.\n\nIt is too early to gauge the full extent of the damage to the region's agricultural industry, but soybean producers are facing up to heavy losses.\n\nRio Grande do Sul lies at a unique geographical meeting point between tropical and polar atmospheres, which can lead to periods of intense rain and drought. Local scientists say the climate crisis has intensified these patterns.\n\nKarina Lima, a scientist and PhD candidate in climatology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul told the AP: 'Models have long predicted that Rio Grande do Sul will continue to see an increase in average annual precipitation and extreme precipitation, meaning more concentrated and severe rainfall.'\n\nThe Brazilian Geological Service confirmed that the current flooding in the state has surpassed the previous record set in 1941. Water levels in some cities are at their highest since records began almost 150 years ago, according to the agency.\n\nGovernor Eduardo Leite called it 'the worst climate disaster that our state ever faced' and added that 'river waters should stay high for some days'. He could not say when the crisis will abate, but he pledged to do 'everything with focus, attention, discipline, and outrage, to ensure that everything within our reach is done'.", "source": {"uri":

The capital, Porto Alegre, has been virtually cut off, with the airport and bus station closed and main roads blocked because of the floodwaters.\n\nThe floods in Brazil are among extreme weather events being seen around the world.\n\nYoga teacher Maria Vit\u00f3ria Jorge's apartment building in downtown Porto Alegre is flooded, so she's leaving it behind, having withdrawn about $1,600 from her savings to rent an apartment for herself and her parents elsewhere in the state.\n\n\"I can't shower at home, wash the dishes or even have drinkable water,\" the 35-year-old Jorge said in her car as she prepared to travel. She had just a gallon of water for the 200-kilometer drive to the city of Torres, so far unaffected by the floods.\n\nFive of the Porto Alegre's six water treatment facilities aren't working, and Porto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo on Monday decreed that water be used exclusively for \"essential consumption.\"\n\n\"We are living an unprecedented natural disaster, and everyone needs to help,\" Melo told journalists. \"I am getting water trucks to soccer fields and people will have to go there to get their water in bottles. I cannot get them to go home to home.\"\n\nThe most urgent need is drinking water, but food and personal hygiene products are also in short supply. Other Brazilian states are mobilizing trucks with donations bound for Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThere were long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets in Porto Alegre on Tuesday. Some people have tried to buy bottled water since the weekend, and when they could find it, their purchases were limited to two five-liter bottles.\n\nPublic health experts say there is also growing risk of disease as much of the region remains submerged, warning that cases of dengue fever and leptospirosis, a bacterial disease, could rise sharply within days.\n\nAdriano Hueck on Tuesday was attempting to retrieve medicine stocked at a friend's warehouse, which is partially flooded.\n\n\"If we can save some of it, there's still a chance it can be useful in hospitals,\" said 53-year-old Hueck, who then pointed toward another part of the city. \"My house is somewhere there. You can't even see its roof now.\"\n\nLike Jorge, the yoga teacher, Rio Grande do Sul residents who can flee are doing so, amid fears of shortage and disease. However, it's difficult for many to leave Porto Alegre with main access roads blocked by floodwaters. The city's airport and main bus terminal are filled with water and closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nClose to the airport, about 100 people from a nearby slum set up tents on the road, hoping to return to their shacks on small boats to try to save some of their belongings. Some roasted chunks of meat on improvised grills.\n\nThe downpour has stopped for now, but a looming cold front will bring more severe rain starting Tuesday night, mainly in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall could exceed 150 millimeters by early Wednesday.\n\nLate Monday, Rio Grande do Sul Gov. Eduardo Leite issued an alert for several cities close to the huge Patos Lagoon. The floodwaters in Porto Alegre and other cities pass through the lagoon to the sea.\n\nCredit : Voice of America (VOA), Photo Credit : Associated Press (AP)", "source": {"uri": "newdelhitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Delhi Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Melo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felipe Melo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rationing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esporte_Clube_Vit\u00f3ria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Esporte Clube Vit\u00f3ria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federative_units_of_Brazil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federative units of Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottled_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bottled water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoa_dos_Patos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lagoa dos Patos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanty_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shanty town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://jetpack.com/redirect/?source=sigenerate&query=t%3DeyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvaTAud3AuY29tXC93d3cubmV3ZGVsaGl0aW1lcy5jb21cL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcL3VwbG9hZHNcLzIwMjRcLzA1XC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjQtMDUtMDgtMTA0NDUxLnBuZz9maXQ9ODkxJTJDNTE2JnF1YWxpdHk9ODAmc3NsPTEiLCJ0eHQiOiJUb28gbXVjaCB3YXRlciwgYW5kIG5vdCBlbm91Z2g6IEJyYXppbCYjODIxNztzIGZsb29kZWQgc291dGggc3RydWdnbGVzIHRvIGFjY2VzcyBiYXNpYyBnb29kcyIsInRlbXBsYXRlIjoiZnVsbHNjcmVlbiIsImJsb2dfaWQiOjM3NTYwNjMzfQ.2TDKLyELDQBU6tn_KZY5kUCy4p4f01MVFgg1Vtv0-6IMQ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

It seems like it's over, that the world has ended.\"\n\nAt least 128 people are still missing, the state's civil defence authority said, urging people living close to the Patos lagoon south of Porto Alegre to leave their homes immediately.\n\nArmy soldiers used amphibious armoured cars to rescue people from flooding in Canoas, just north of the city, where the waters have reached a depth of some three meters (10 ft) and the streets can only be navigated by boat.\n\nA Reuters journalist saw one team of local volunteer rescuers find about 20 dogs stranded on the second floor of an abandoned factory, offering food to those too fierce to take aboard.\n\nPorto Alegre city hall warned such civilian rescuers on Wednesday afternoon to halt their operations, given the forecast for rain, lightning storms and winds exceeding 80 km per hour (50 mph).\n\nIn the Porto Alegre suburb of Eldorado do Sul, tractor driver Daniel Farias said he had spent days ferrying survivors to safety, carrying whole families out on his wheel loader, including pets.\n\n\"I have been living in this tractor with my children, to survive this calamity. We believe it will pass,\" an exhausted Farias told Reuters. He said he had slept little and eaten less.\n\nRISK OF MORE FLOODS\n\nBrazil's national centre for natural disasters warned that the southern area of Rio Grande do Sul state was under \"high risk\" of more flooding, with rainfall expected to restart after a brief hiatus.\n\nWeather forecaster MetSul said in a statement the region could face more \"very large\" floods \"of serious proportions\".\n\nIn neighbouring Uruguay, storms and flooding have closed highways and left nearly 800 people displaced and over 3,000 people without power, the government said.\n\nIn Brazil, many residents in and around Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million people, have been living in darkness after power companies cut off electricity for security reasons.\n\nThey have faced shortages of products, especially drinking water. Supermarket managers said there was no access for supply trucks or employees trying to get to work. Mineral water sales were restricted in some supermarkets.\n\nVolunteer rescue operations after dark in Porto Alegre were also hampered by looting, with police providing security using boats and even jet skis.\n\n\"We are not going out to rescue people at night without an armed escort, because it has become too risky,\" volunteer Lauro Strogulski told Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in",

All discharge and loading operations in the port are stopped with no forecast for return while all flights are cancelled. The airport is also used for crew changes in the ports. With the floods closing both the airport and the ports, crew changes are on hold until further notice. Transport links and energy supplies have been cut as well.\n\nThe immense rain also caused the dam of the 100MW 14 de Julho hydroelectric plant on the Antas River to rupture last week. Power generation company Companhia Energetica Rio das Antas, which runs the plant, implemented an emergency evacuation plan on May 1.\n\nBrazilian steelmaker Gerdau suspended its operations in two mills until it can ensure people's protection and safety, and logistics company Rumo partially interrupted operations and said that damages to assets are still being properly measured.\n\nPetrochemical giant Braskem shut down its facilities at the Triunfo petrochemical complex as a preventive measure because of extreme weather events on May 3, and it currently has no estimate for the resumption of activities there. Braskem operates eight industrial units in Rio Grande do Sul that make 5m tonnes per year of basic petrochemicals, polyethylene, and polypropylene.\n\nMuch of Rio Grande do Sul has been hit by persistent, heavy rainfall since April 27. In some regions, rainfall volumes have exceeded 300 millimetres in less than a week. In the municipality of Bento Gon\u00e7alves, for example, the volume reached 543.4 millimetres. Porto Alegre received 258.6 millimetres of rainfall in just three days. This figure corresponds to more than two months of rain compared to the normal for April and May.\n\nDue to the massive damages from the natural disaster, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva asked Congress on Monday to recognise a state of public calamity for the heavy rains which would allow extra government spending with no need to comply with a spending cap stipulated by fiscal rules approved last year.\n\nThe floods have rekindled memories of the huge rains that collapsed a dam in Brazil in 2015 which resulted in the deaths of 19 people and floods in dozens of towns. The dam was at an iron ore mine owned by Samarco, a joint venture between Brazil's Vale and the Anglo-Australian miner BHP.\n\nA few days after these recent rains started, Vale and BHP proposed paying a nearly $25bn settlement to repair the damages caused by the collapse.", "source": {"uri": "splash247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Splash247"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bojan_lepic@splash247.com",

( Image Source :Getty Images )\n\nAs the Brazil floods entered the second week of the devastating situation, the death toll rose to 90. As per the state's Civil Defence agency, apart from the 90 fatalities, four other deaths are being investigated. The flood has left thousands of people homeless, reported news agency Reuters.\n\nWhile the rescue work is still in progress, the state capital of Porto Alegre has been virtually cut off because of the flooding. The flooding at various places has also slowed rescue efforts. Power cuts and lack of essentials and water have only worsened the situation. More than a million people have been directly or indirectly hit by the floods in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on a government television programme promised to extend federal aid to the affected people. Recently, Lula da Silva took an aerial view of the southern Rio Grande do Sul to take stock of the situation and the extent of damage that the flood had caused. He was accompanied by several of his Cabinet members. However, in the official statement, the government has stated that until the waters of Brazil's 'worst ever climate disaster' subside, it would not be easy to calculate the extent of the damage.\n\nThe flood's impact could also hit in Brazil's GDP growth, as per JP Morgan economists, who have also predicted that Brazil's economy would be hit, with a marginally increased inflation, mainly due to a higher price of rice produced in Rio Grande do Sul.

Petrobras' Canoas refinery was still supplying fossil fuel, it said. State capital Porto Alegre's Salgado Filho International Airport, one of Brazil's busiest, had its operations suspended indefinitely, operator Fraport said.\n\nRailway operator Rumo said train

There is no immediate respite in sight.\n\nAccording to the Civil Defense of Rio Grande do Sul, 78 people have been confirmed dead, 105 others are still missing and 175 have been injured. Nearly 19,000 people have been made homeless, almost 116,000 displaced, and nearly 850,000 affected across 341 municipalities.\n\nNational authorities have rescued 1,000 people through rescue and emergency operations, as reported by the Civil Defense of Rio Grande do Sul. Brazilian President Lula da Silva toured the worst affected regions and announced a package of emergency measures to help victims.\n\nImages showed the huge extent of the flooding. The airport in the state capital Porto Alegre was closed, with transport links and energy supplies cut.\n\nThe European Union's Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMSR720) was activated in rapid mapping mode on 3 May to provide flood extent and damage assessment.\n\nThe disaster in Brazil - and ongoing flooding in East Africa - highlight the need for a more integrated response to El Ni\u00f1o and climate change impacts and Early Warnings For All, as called for by WMO at a special United Nations thematic event on 1 May.\n\nBrazil's national meteorological and hydrological service, INMET, issued another red alert for storms on 6 May, with moderate to localized heavy rainfall and thunderstorms and a very high high hydrological risk. The conditions are also affecting northern Uruguay.\n\nMuch of Rio Grande do Sul has been hit by persistent, heavy rainfall since 27 April, according to INMET. In some regions, especially in the broad central valleys, plateau, mountain slopes and metropolitan areas, rainfall volumes have exceeded 300 millimetres (mm) in less than a week. In the municipality of Bento Gon\u00e7alves, for example, the volume reached 543.4 mm.\n\nPorto Alegre received 258.6 mm of rainfall in just three days. This figure corresponds to more than two months of rain when compared to the Climatological Normal for April (114.4 mm) and May (112.8 mm).\n\nThe period between the end of April and the beginning of May 2024 is still influenced by El Ni\u00f1o. The phenomenon, responsible for warming the waters of the Pacific, helped block cold fronts and concentrate the systems of areas of instability over Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nIn addition to this condition, the much higher temperature of the South Atlantic Ocean, close to the equatorial belt, also contributes to the humidity, intensifying the rainfall. The transport of humidity from the Amazon and the thermal contrast with warmer air to the north of the Southern Region, as well as colder air to the south of Rio Grande do Sul, also helped to strengthen the storms, said INMET.\n\nThe WMO State of the Climate in Latin America and the Caribbean 2023, to be released on 8 May, will examine El Ni\u00f1o and climate change impacts on the region in the past year. This was also high on the agenda of meetings between WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo and government leaders in Chile from 1-2 May.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Petrobras' Canoas refinery was still supplying fossil fuel, it said.\n\nState capital Porto Alegre's Salgado Filho International Airport, one of Brazil's busiest, had its operations suspended indefinitely, operator Fraport said.\n\nRailway operator Rumo said train circulation in the state was partially interrupted due to the extreme weather and damage to assets is \"still being duly

A survey among component factories in Rio Grande do Sul revealed significant stoppages, particularly around Porto Alegre, where facilities are wholly paralyzed due to floodwaters. While some areas of the state are less affected, allowing production to limp on, logistical nightmares abound due to road closures that block the transportation of essential components to assembly plants.\n\nIn Gravata\u00ed, the situation is slightly better, with factories only mildly affected and alternative transportation routes being utilized. However, factories in the Caxias area find themselves isolated and cut off from supply lines and distribution networks.\n\nDespite these challenges, Shad remains optimistic that the industry can maintain operations without a shortage of components. He believes that the current difficulties are temporary and will be swiftly overcome. \"We are working to minimize the impact of this tragedy as much as possible,\" he asserted, though he admitted that the severe conditions might affect next month's production figures.\n\nThe broader picture in Rio Grande do Sul is grim. According to the latest report from Civil Defense, the torrential rains and resulting floods have left at least 95 people dead and 128 missing. Neighboring state Santa Catarina also reported casualties. The disaster has affected 1.5 million people, with approximately 400 injured and 80% of municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul impacted by the floods.\n\nThe floods have laid bare the vulnerabilities in the region's infrastructure and emergency preparedness. The automotive sector, pivotal to Brazil's economy, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, underscores a larger narrative of how climate change and environmental disasters increasingly impact industrial operations and economic stability in Latin America.\n\nThe region's dependence on localized industries, such as automotive manufacturing, makes it particularly susceptible to such disruptions. Policymakers and business leaders have been aware of the potential risks for years. Still, the recent events have injected a new urgency into the discourse on sustainable industrial practices and disaster readiness.\n\nBrazil's current crisis could serve as a wake-up call in Latin America, where many countries are prone to natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. It highlights the need for comprehensive strategies integrating environmental considerations with industrial planning to ensure resilience against future catastrophes.\n\nMoreover, the economic implications of these disruptions are far-reaching. The automotive industry in Brazil is not only a significant employer but also a major contributor to GDP. The current interruptions could have ripple effects across the national economy, affecting everything from export volumes to local job markets.\n\nAs the region begins to recover and rebuild, the lessons learned from this crisis will likely influence future approaches to industrial development and disaster management in Latin America. Integrating more robust infrastructure, better predictive models for climate-related events, and a more agile response mechanism are imperative.\n\nFurthermore, the human cost of these floods must be considered. The loss of life and the displacement of thousands of families bring a human dimension to the economic calculations, reminding stakeholders that beyond the production lines and supply chains are communities that bear the brunt of these disasters.\n\nLula Presses for Brazilian Beef Imports in Japan Trade Talks\n\nAs Brazil navigates this challenging period, the resilience of its people and the strategic responses from its industries will be pivotal in shaping the nation's path forward. For the automotive sector, in particular, this is a critical moment to reassess and reinforce its operations to withstand the current crisis and future challenges in an increasingly uncertain global climate.", "source": {"uri": "latinamericanpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "latinamericanpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_e_Recreativa_Caxias_do_Sul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sociedade Esportiva e Recreativa Caxias do Sul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Brazil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravata\u00ed", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gravata\u00ed"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gravata\u00ed"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Catarina (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Catarina (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://latinamericanpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240509_Floods-in-Brazil-Impact-on-Auto-Industry-and-National-Recovery.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549109", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

At least 75 have died and 103 are missing, according to the latest official report. Several neighborhoods of Porto Alegre, the most populated city in the region, are under water while its international airport announced on Firday night it would close for an undetermined amount of time.\n\nCompanies that had announced they were suspending activities due to the heavy rains are now announcing they will resume their normal work on Monday.\n\nLanding in Rio Grande do Sul for the second time this week, President Lula was to met with state Governor Eduardo Leite, according to social media posts. Leite is calling for federal aid to rebuild the infrastructure of his region, saying the effort needed compares to the billions of dollars spent by the US government in the Marshall Plan to recover its economy after World War II.\n\nLula is also holding a press conference with Leite and government officials.\n\nFinance Minister Fernando Haddad and Chief of Staff Rui Costa are among more than 10 cabinet members who traveled to the region.\n\nThis is the fourth wave of extreme weather Rio Grande do Sul has faced in less than a year. Experts say the floods are the worst in 80 years, surpassing those of 1941, when rains continued for more than 30 straight days.

'Be careful, okay? These animals, they stay on the banks, and the banks are now inside the city, okay?' a local biologist warned on social media after sharing a video of a reptile swimming.\n\n'So, if you see one, it looks like a big log, don't come close, okay?'

At least 32 people were arrested Monday for crimes, including invasions and damages of property and vandalism, according to the Military Brigade.\n\n'We will exert full force for public security,' Leite said. The governor initially asked the government to turn over policing to the armed forces before petitioning for 400 National Force members.\n\n'We will bring order to the state.

A Reuters journalist saw one team of local volunteer rescuers find about 20 dogs stranded on the second floor of an abandoned factory, offering food to those too fierce to take aboard.\n\nPorto Alegre city hall warned such civilian rescuers on Wednesday afternoon to halt their operations, given the forecast for rain, lightning storms and winds exceeding 80 km per hour (50 mph). In the Porto Alegre suburb of Eldorado do Sul, tractor driver Daniel Farias said he had spent days ferrying survivors to safety, carrying whole families out on his wheel loader, including pets.\n\n\"I have been living in this tractor with my children, to survive this calamity. We believe it will pass,\" an exhausted Farias told Reuters. He said he had slept little and eaten less. RISK OF MORE FLOODS\n\nBrazil's national center for natural disasters warned that the southern area of Rio Grande do Sul state was under \"high risk\" of more flooding, with rainfall expected to restart after a brief hiatus. Weather forecaster MetSul said in a statement the region could face more \"very large\" floods \"of serious proportions\".\n\nIn neighboring Uruguay, storms and flooding have closed highways and left nearly 800 people displaced and over 3,000 people without power, the government said. In Brazil, many residents in and around Porto Alegre, a city of 1.3 million people, have been living in darkness after power companies cut off electricity for security reasons.\n\nThey have faced shortages of products, especially drinking water. Supermarket managers said there was no access for supply trucks or employees trying to get to work. Mineral water sales were restricted in some supermarkets. Volunteer rescue operations after dark in Porto Alegre were also hampered by looting, with police providing security using boats and even jet skis.\n\n\"We are not going out to rescue people at night without an armed escort, because it has become too risky,\" volunteer Lauro Strogulski told Reuters.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

Dozens of highways have been blocked. Most in the state capital are without running water. And the death toll is already at 80 - and sure to climb higher.\n\nEven in a country increasingly inured to natural disasters driven by climate change, the flooding that has slammed into Rio Grande do Sul, one of Brazil's most prosperous states, has badly shaken this nation of 215 million. With more than half the cities in the state dealing with flooding, and 20,000 left homeless, Rio Grande do Sul hasn't just been damaged. It has been crippled.\n\n\"This is the worst disaster ever registered in the state of Rio Grande do Sul,\" state Gov. Eduardo Leite said. \"Perhaps one of the worst disasters that the country has registered in recent history.\"\n\nIn recent years, Brazil has often grappled with natural disasters: record rains, devastating floods, crippling droughts and deadly landslides. Political leaders and scientists here have never been shy about blaming climate change and calling for greater action - rhetoric that has often failed to materialize into concrete plans.\n\nBut the public comments this time appeared far more urgent.\n\nDuring a flyover of the devastation Sunday, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva appeared to be openly moved, according to senior aides who accompanied the president and spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss his reactions.\n\nHis mood was \"a mixture of agony and anger,\" said one adviser. \"He kept saying, 'Oh, my God. Look at this.'\"\n\nAfter he landed, he told aides his comments needed to reflect the magnitude of the disaster. He held a meeting with senior congressional and judicial officials, saying Brazil needed to change how it approached climate disasters. He called for the creation of a national plan to prevent \"climatic accidents,\" tasking top environmental lieutenant Marina Silva to begin formulating a strategy.\n\n\"We have to stop just running after disaster,\" Lula said. \"We have to start preparing for what can happen from disasters.\"\n\nIn a comment exclusively provided to The Washington Post, Lula said he blamed the devastation in Rio Grande do Sul on the failures of the global community to respond to climate change. He said there was a \"historic debt.\" Poorer countries that have historically emitted few greenhouse gases, he said, are suffering due to the pollution of wealthier nations.\n\n\"This was the third record flood in the same region of the country in less than a year,\" Lula told The Post. \"We and the world need to prepare every day more with plans and resources to deal with extreme climate occurrences.\"\n\nIn 10 days, Rio Grande do Sul was soaked by the equivalent of three months' worth of rain. The Gua\u00edba River, which hugs the Porto Alegre coast and is fed by a network of engorged tributaries, swelled to a record height of 5 meters. It gushed its muddy waters into the city and submerged much of its cosmopolitan downtown.\n\nThe base scenario in the city is not likely to change for several weeks, and could worsen. Scientists predict that the Gua\u00edba won't drop below 3 meters - the river's flood limit - until the end of May. Meanwhile, temperatures are expected to lower to 50 degrees in the coming days, increasing the risk for hypothermia, as rains refuse to relent and cities teeter on the precipice of anarchy.\n\nResembling scenes from Houston post-Hurricane Harvey, or New Orleans post-Katrina, people all over the flood zone are stranded atop roofs. Hospitals are without power. Widespread looting has broken out. A gas station exploded in north Porto Alegre. Inmates at local prisons that suffered flooding have been released. With roads shut down and the airport closed until at least May 30, there are few means of escape.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, one woman with her parents in a Porto Alegre suburb documented on social media her fears as the waters rose. \"I'm with two elderly people who can't climb up onto the roof,\" she wrote, according to a story in O Globo. \"We're going to die drowned. Send help, by the love of God.\"\n\nThe family was ultimately saved the next day, as her mother showed signs of hypothermia.\n\nPanic and uncertainty are now ripping through the state, as thousands live without power, access to the internet or even potable water.\n\nThe mayor of the suburb Canoas, which has been devastated by the flooding, announced that nine patients had died in a critical care unit after the hospital lost power - only to later correct himself and say he'd been wrong.\n\n\"It's chaos here,\" said journalist Kelly Matos. \"I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\nShe said she recently went to a market and didn't find a single bottle of water. Others are trying to bathe with sparkling water.\n\n\"This is war; that is the word,\" she said. \"It's hopelessness, civil unrest. ...

There is no immediate respite in sight.\n\nAccording to the Civil Defense of Rio Grande do Sul, 78 people have been confirmed dead, 105 others are still missing and 175 have been injured. Nearly 19,000 people have been made homeless, almost 116,000 displaced, and nearly 850,000 affected across 341 municipalities.\n\nNational authorities have rescued 1,000 people through rescue and emergency operations, as reported by the Civil Defense of Rio Grande do Sul. Brazilian President Lula da Silva toured the worst affected regions and announced a package of emergency measures to help victims.\n\nImages showed the huge extent of the flooding. The airport in the state capital Porto Alegre was closed, with transport links and energy supplies cut.\n\nThe European Union's Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMSR720) was activated in rapid mapping mode on 3 May to provide flood extent and damage assessment.\n\nThe disaster in Brazil - and ongoing flooding in East Africa - highlight the need for a more integrated response to El Ni\u00f1o and climate change impacts and Early Warnings For All, as called for by WMO at a special United Nations thematic event on 1 May.\n\nBrazil's national meteorological and hydrological service, INMET, issued another red alert for storms on 6 May, with moderate to localized heavy rainfall and thunderstorms and a very high high hydrological risk. The conditions are also affecting northern Uruguay.\n\nMuch of Rio Grande do Sul has been hit by persistent, heavy rainfall since 27 April, according to INMET. In some regions, especially in the broad central valleys, plateau, mountain slopes and metropolitan areas, rainfall volumes have exceeded 300 millimetres (mm) in less than a week. In the municipality of Bento Gon\u00e7alves, for example, the volume reached 543.4 mm.\n\nPorto Alegre received 258.6 mm of rainfall in just three days. This figure corresponds to more than two months of rain when compared to the Climatological Normal for April (114.4 mm) and May (112.8 mm).\n\nThe period between the end of April and the beginning of May 2024 is still influenced by El Ni\u00f1o. The phenomenon, responsible for warming the waters of the Pacific, helped block cold fronts and concentrate the systems of areas of instability over Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nIn addition to this condition, the much higher temperature of the South Atlantic Ocean, close to the equatorial belt, also contributes to the humidity, intensifying the rainfall. The transport of humidity from the Amazon and the thermal contrast with warmer air to the north of the Southern Region, as well as colder air to the south of Rio Grande do Sul, also helped to strengthen the storms, said INMET.\n\nThe WMO State of the Climate in Latin America and the Caribbean 2023, to be released on 8 May, will examine El Ni\u00f1o and climate change impacts on the region in the past year. This was also high on the agenda of meetings between WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo and government leaders in Chile from 1-2 May.", "source": {"uri": "wmo.int", "dataType": "news", "title":

This is a fiscal framework adopted by the Brazilian government to prevent an escalation of its public debt.\n\nThe legislative decree is based on Article 65 of the fiscal responsibility law.

There is no immediate respite in sight.\n\nAccording to the Civil Defense of Rio Grande do Sul, 78 people have been confirmed dead, 105 others are still missing and 175 have been injured. Nearly 19,000 people have been made homeless, almost 116,000 displaced, and nearly 850,000 affected across 341 municipalities.\n\nNational authorities have rescued 1,000 people through rescue and emergency operations, as reported by the Civil Defense of Rio Grande do Sul. Brazilian President Lula da Silva toured the worst affected regions and announced a package of emergency measures to help victims.\n\nImages showed the huge extent of the flooding. The airport in the state capital Porto Alegre was closed, with transport links and energy supplies cut.\n\nThe European Union's Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMSR720) was activated in rapid mapping mode on 3 May to provide flood extent and damage assessment.\n\nThe disaster in Brazil - and ongoing flooding in East Africa - highlight the need for a more integrated response to El Ni\u00f1o and climate change impacts and Early Warnings For All, as called for by WMO at a special United Nations thematic event on 1 May.\n\nBrazil's national meteorological and hydrological service, INMET, issued another red alert for storms on 6 May, with moderate to localized heavy rainfall and thunderstorms and a very high high hydrological risk. The conditions are also affecting northern Uruguay.\n\nMuch of Rio Grande do Sul has been hit by persistent, heavy rainfall since 27 April, according to INMET. In some regions, especially in the broad central valleys, plateau, mountain slopes and metropolitan areas, rainfall volumes have exceeded 300 millimetres (mm) in less than a week. In the municipality of Bento Gon\u00e7alves, for example, the volume reached 543.4 mm.\n\nPorto Alegre received 258.6 mm of rainfall in just three days. This figure corresponds to more than two months of rain when compared to the Climatological Normal for April (114.4 mm) and May (112.8 mm).\n\nThe period between the end of April and the beginning of May 2024 is still influenced by El Ni\u00f1o. The phenomenon, responsible for warming the waters of the Pacific, helped block cold fronts and concentrate the systems of areas of instability over Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nIn addition to this condition, the much higher temperature of the South Atlantic Ocean, close to the equatorial belt, also contributes to the humidity, intensifying the rainfall. The transport of humidity from the Amazon and the thermal contrast with warmer air to the north of the Southern Region, as well as colder air to the south of Rio Grande do Sul, also helped to strengthen the storms, said INMET.\n\nThe WMO State of the Climate in Latin America and the Caribbean 2023, to be released on 8 May, will examine El Ni\u00f1o and climate change impacts on the region in the past year. This was also high on the agenda of meetings between WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo and government leaders in Chile from 1-2 May.\n\n/Public Release.

This is the same state that endured three climate disasters in 2023 alone, with 80 people confirmed dead and many cities hit.\n\nThe following day, the agency posted another alert: \"Serious risk of floods in southern Brazil because of excessive to extreme rain. It has already rained 200 mm [8 inches] in some areas and projections indicate much more water coming. 2023 scenes of flooded cities will be repeated.\"\n\nTwo days later, they began to post about overflowing creeks, rising river levels, and flooding while The National Institute of Meteorology (Inmet) put the entire state under alert, showing a varying scale from yellow to red, the latter being the larger portion. On April 30, the local government confirmed eight dead and 21 people disappeared.\n\nEver since the publication of this story on May 7, the worst natural disaster in the history of Rio Grande do Sul has registered 100 dead, 128 disappeared, and over 1.4 million people affected. Sums that seem still underreported when one sees the images of entire cities underwater.\n\nAmong the 497 cities in the state, 414 were hit so far. And, as you read it, there is a chance people are still waiting on roofs for rescue, trapped in houses and buildings surrounded by water. Others are still looking for victims of landslides; and many are without access to clean water, power, or ways of coming and going from their cities, with bridges missing and roads destroyed. The rain is moving south and is forecasted to return to other cities already impacted.\n\nIn September 2023, after the worst climate disaster Rio Grande do Sul had registered at the time, re-elected governor Eduardo Leite (PSDB, Social Democracy Party) said in an interview for Globo News TV channel that \"math models couldn't foresee the volume of rains.\" This time, there isn't any surprise.\n\nAn expert quoted by Deutsch Welle says the state became a target now because of an overlay of weather phenomenons, like recent heat waves and the influence of El Ni\u00f1o. Although Marcelo Seluchi, coordinator of Cemaden (National Center of Monitoring and Alert for Natural Disasters), says no place in the world would be able to resist this situation, \"there could have been contingency and prevention plans.\" \"You can't do it from one week to the other. This is something missing,\" he said.\n\nThe first cities hit by the local catastrophe that swallowed Rio Grande do Sul registered landslides, bridges destroyed and floods that covered cities and highways, making help even more difficult to arrive.\n\nThis place is at the line between cities of Bento Gon\u00e7alves and Veran\u00f3polis, in the Arches' bridge, a rural area. People used to go there to enjoy pubs and restaurantes around, with local cuisine. We had houses and restaurants, an important road. There is nothing anymore.\n\nNOW | An historical front page and one of the most impactful ones in the 100 years of Correio do Povo newspaper, in a special edition this Friday, with the image of Taquari Valley submerged and lightning in the background with the storm.\n\nIn the state capital, Porto Alegre, the Gua\u00edba River surpassed an 83-year historic mark when it reached 4.77 meters of elevation. It has reached 5.3 meters now -- its system limit to cause a flood is 3 meters. Neighborhoods that had never registered floods had to be evacuated, but many residents remained isolated in their homes. Over 85 percent of the population had no access to clean water, even in supermarkets, and the airport is still under water, with flights estimated to be suspended till the end of the month. Nonada, a Global Voices' partner, had to cease publishing for a few days.\n\nWhile the world, the rest of Brazil and 1.6 million people on the ground watched Madonna's free concert in Rio de Janeiro, on April 4, on social media, people shared addresses with calls for rescue and help in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre, videos of volunteers working and alarming rumors about corpses and violence.\n\nA touching image from Canoas, where people do a human chain to help the watercrafts used to rescue people isolated.\n\nWith the high demand for assistance, besides police and the armed forces, many volunteers joined the front amidst the emergency.\n\nGr\u00eamio and Internacional, the two traditional football teams and rivals from Porto Alegre, had their stadiums invaded by waters. While both clubs are trying to stop the championships they play, footballers from both teams have been helping with rescues and volunteering in donation centres and shelters.\n\nCa\u00edque is helping to rescue people by boat.\n\nRochet is helping since day one to make and to distribute packed lunches.\n\nDiego Costa arranged jet-skis, sheltered people in his home and is using his jeep.\n\nThiago Maia is also helping.\n\nInfluencers outside of Rio Grande do Sul also joined massive donation campaigns and actions. A Brazilian surfer, Pedro Scooby, gathered friends and travelled by road with jet skies to support the ongoing rescues, digital influencer Felipe Neto managed to rent and arrange trucks to carry drinkable water from a water park to the cities affected, humorist Whinderson Nunes rented aircraft and organized food donations.\n\nStill, reports of financial scams using the floods, politicians and influencers spreading fake news and attempts of robbery and attacks on houses are increasing.\n\nJournalist Isabela Reis crossed news and posts in a thread trying to understand the timeline until the explosion of the climate disaster, calling out the state government for \"neglect and inoperability.\" Many on social media complain of people \"trying to politicize the tragedy,\" while others emphasize politics has everything to do with it.\n\nTo BBC Brazil, executive-secretary to the Climate Watch (Observat\u00f3rio do Clima), Marcio Astrini, said \"The tragedy is also a responsibility of senators and members of the congress who disassemble the environmental legislation,\" and stated:\n\nTodo ano o governo do Rio Grande do Sul fica extremamente espantado que as chuvas s\u00e3o intensas. O governo do Rio de Janeiro fica super surpreso quando acontece em Petr\u00f3polis. \u00c9 uma surpresa em S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (SP), no norte de Minas Gerais, em Recife (PE), no sul da Bahia. S\u00f3 que acontece que j\u00e1 faz nove anos consecutivos que as m\u00e9dias de temperatura do planeta s\u00e3o as mais quentes j\u00e1 registradas. N\u00e3o tem mais surpresa. A gente precisa se preparar para isso.\n\nEvery year the government of Rio Grande do Sul gets extremely flabbergasted that rains are intense. The government of Rio de Janeiro gets surprised when it happens in Petr\u00f3polis. It's a surprise in S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo, in northern Minas Gerais, in Recife (Pernambuco), in the south of Bahia. It happens that it has been nine consecutive years with temperature averages as the hottest ones ever recorded. There is no surprise anymore. We need to brace ourselves for that.\n\nEduardo Leite, the center-right state governor, defended himself from critics, saying \"this is not the time to look for culprits.\" People questioned the state's preparation to mitigate the consequences of the current rains and floods or the aftermath to help out victims. During his two terms, Leite altered points in the environmental legislation, made rules to install dams in environmental preservation areas more flexible, and reduced the budget destined for the Civil Defense from 2023 to 2024.\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's government (PT, Workers' Party) installed a crisis cabinet in the state and recognized calamity status for several cities, which could make a budget increase more accessible and unlimited.\n\nEnvironment Minister Marina Silva was among the ministers who traveled with Lula to Rio Grande do Sul. In an interview with CNN Brazil, she talked about the idea of a climate emergency decree for 1,942 cities in Brazil that are susceptible to extreme climate occurrences. Marina explained:\n\nAo decretar emerg\u00eancia clim\u00e1tica, voc\u00ea pode ter a\u00e7\u00f5es que sejam continuadas, \u00e0s vezes de remo\u00e7\u00e3o de popula\u00e7\u00e3o, de drenagem, de

of Emergency as Floods Death Toll Rises to 85, Dozens Remain Missing", "body": "President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva urged Congress to acknowledge a state of calamity in Rio Grande do Sul following devastating Brazil floods that claimed at least 85 lives.\n\nThe Brazil floods, triggered by heavy rains, have left more than 130 individuals missing and displaced approximately 150,000 residents across nearly 500 municipalities in the state.\n\nThe deluge has wrought havoc, destroying infrastructure, including roads and bridges, and precipitating landslides, Reuters reports.\n\nRio Grande do Sul's civil defense authority reports that over two-thirds of the state's cities have been adversely affected by the flooding, underscoring the scale of the catastrophe.\n\nLula da Silva's proposal to Congress seeks authorization for additional government spending without adhering to fiscal constraints established last year.\n\nThis measure aims to expedite the state's recovery efforts and alleviate the plight of affected residents.\n\nPlanning Minister Simone Tebet emphasized the need for a comprehensive assessment of the post-water recession to ascertain the full extent of the damage.\n\nAmid the chaos, the death toll continues to mount, with the state's civil defense unit confirming at least 85 fatalities.\n\nAuthorities are currently conducting inquiries to ascertain the details surrounding an additional four deaths potentially linked to the storms.\n\nMoreover, over 276 individuals are reported injured, and approximately 111 remain missing, heightening concerns about the disaster's human toll.\n\nREAD NEXT: Death Toll Climbs to 78 in Brazil Floods, Over 100 Still Missing\n\nApproximately 1,000 firefighters are engaged in rescue operations, striving to save as many lives as possible.\n\nRescue teams navigate treacherous waters, employing inflatable rafts to evacuate residents, including pets, from inundated areas.\n\nDespite challenges, responders persevere, conducting short-term operations during lulls in rainfall to maximize their impact, according to CNN.\n\nRio Grande do Sul has witnessed an escalation in extreme weather phenomena with devastating consequences.\n\nLast September, the state endured a sub-tropical cyclone that claimed the lives of 54 individuals.\n\nThe escalating intensity and frequency of such events underscore the compounding impact of the climate crisis, exacerbated by human activities.\n\nWhile weather conditions temporarily improved, forecasts indicate the likelihood of renewed rainfall in the coming days.\n\nThe looming threat of further inundation exacerbates the urgency of rescue and relief efforts.\n\nGovernor Eduardo Leite warns of a potentially substantial increase in the death toll as responders gain access to more isolated regions.\n\nPresident Lula da Silva, accompanied by key officials, including most of his cabinet, visited Rio Grande do Sul to survey the devastation firsthand.\n\nLula pledged unwavering governmental support, vowing to surmount bureaucratic hurdles hindering the state's reconstruction efforts.\n\nThe president's presence underscores the gravity of the situation and the nation's solidarity in times of crisis, CBC News noted.\n\nAs Rio Grande do Sul grapples with the aftermath of catastrophic Brazil floods, concerted rescue and recovery efforts are underway to mitigate the humanitarian and economic fallout.\n\nThe declaration of a state of calamity underscores the severity of the situation, necessitating swift and decisive action from both federal and state authorities.\n\nAmid the tragedy, the resilience of affected communities and the unwavering commitment of responders offer glimmers of hope amid the devastation.", "source": {"uri": "latinpost.com",

The catastrophic weather has resulted in the deaths of 55 individuals, with 74 more reported missing and nearly 25,000 residents forced from their homes.\n\nThe onslaught began last Saturday and has not only shattered lives but also severely disrupted the region's infrastructure. Authorities report that half a million people are currently without power and clean water, and with meteorologists predicting more rainfall, the situation could worsen.\n\nThis disaster is unfolding in a region known for its robust agriculture and pivotal role in Brazil's economy. The destruction of roads and bridges, particularly in rural areas, threatens to weaken local economies and delay recovery efforts. The storm's impact has been so severe that more than half of the state's 497 cities have experienced significant damage.\n\nIn a particularly tragic incident, a hydroelectric dam near Bento Gon\u00e7alves collapsed, resulting in 30 deaths. This event underscores the severe strain that extreme weather can place on infrastructure. A second dam is reportedly at risk, raising fears of further devastation.\n\nPorto Alegre, the state capital, has seen some of the worst flooding. The Gua\u00edba River, which courses through the city, overflowed its banks, inundating streets and submerging neighborhoods. The flooding has been so severe that the city's international airport has indefinitely halted all flights, signaling a significant disruption in local and global connectivity.\n\nResidents of the affected areas have expressed heartbreak and despair over the damage. Maria Luiza, a local interviewed by the BBC, shared her sorrow: \"I live in this area, so I feel sorry for everyone who lives here. It's unfortunate and regrettable that all this is happening.\" Their pain is palpable, and it's a reminder of the human cost of these disasters.\n\nThe cause of these extreme weather events has been attributed to a rare combination of factors: unusually high temperatures, strong winds, and high humidity. These conditions have been linked to the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon, which disrupts standard weather patterns across the globe, leading to severe weather conditions such as those currently affecting Brazil.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has visited the region, pledging federal support for the victims and recovery efforts. The promise of aid is a relief to many, though the road to recovery is expected to be long and challenging.\n\nThis series of disasters in Rio Grande do Sul reflects a broader trend observed across Latin America, where the intensity and frequency of natural disasters have escalated due to climate change. These events, occurring with alarming frequency, underscore the urgent need for robust climate resilience and disaster preparedness strategies. The time for action is now.\n\nMeteorologists warn that the situation may deteriorate as a cold front is expected to bring additional rains. The immediate focus remains on rescue and relief operations, securing vulnerable structures, and providing shelter and necessities to displaced residents.\n\nThe ongoing crisis in Rio Grande do Sul serves as a poignant reminder of the growing impact of climate change and extreme weather events. It also highlights the necessity for comprehensive policies that address climate adaptation and mitigation, especially in regions prone to such natural calamities.\n\nFirst Lady of Brazil to Sue Musk's X for Account Hack\n\nAs Brazil grapples with the aftermath of this tragedy, the global community watches and learns, hoping to better prepare for the increasing unpredictability of weather patterns. Rio Grande do Sul's people, in the face of this unprecedented disaster, are demonstrating a resilience that is truly inspiring.

There are a lot of people making a difference and you can too.\"\n\nAnother F1 personality to join the rescue efforts for floods in Brazil is model Francisca 'Kika' Cerqueira Gomes. Kika, who is dating Alpine F1 team's driver Pierre Gasly, shared a video released by renowned supermodel and Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bundchen. Gisele made an appeal for donations towards the relief operations carried out in the affected area.\n\nBundchen said, \"My home state in Rio Grande do Sul, south in Brazil, has had its worst tragedy in its history. Heavy rains flooded entire towns in most parts of the state. It's not just one city, it's more than 350 cities affected. People are not only losing their houses, their jobs, they're losing everything and there are many still to be rescued.\"\n\nThe Brazilian model shared devastating visuals from ground zero while making an emotional appeal. She also shared snippets of rescue operations but urged her followers to contribute more to help the locals affected.\n\nBrazil is one of the most iconic places where Formula 1 races year after year. The country also has a special connection to the sport through Lewis Hamilton, who got honorary citizenship just two years ago.\n\nWhile the seven-time world champion is expected to make an appeal soon, many other F1 drivers can join him too. A similar effort was seen in 2023 when Italy went through devastating floods resulting in F1 calling off the Imola race.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nischay_rathore@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Nischay Rathore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper's_Bazaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harper's Bazaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Piquet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Piquet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B\u00fcndchen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Piquet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Piquet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portuguese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Gasly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/916dd639-verstappen-kelly-piquet-ser.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549109", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Over 1 million residents have been somehow affected.\n\nThe tragic situation was mentioned by Pope Francis after Sunday's Regina C\u0153li.\n\n\"I want to assure my prayers for the population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, affected by major floods. May the Lord welcome the dead and comfort their families and those who had to abandon their homes,\" the pope said.\n\nWith several districts under water, entire farms destroyed, and devastated infrastructure all over the region, those words brought solace to many, said Bishop Cleonir Dalbosco of the Diocese of Bag\u00e9, in the southern part of the state.\n\n\"The pope's message comforted many Catholics and non-Catholics as well. Besides the Church's effort to collect and distribute donations, we have been working to give spiritual support and hope to the impacted people,\" Dalbosco, who is the vice president of the Bishops' Conference's state chapter, told Crux.\n\nThis has been the third major flood to impact the state in the past months. The most recent event, which happened in September of 2023, killed 54 people. In Dalbosco's diocese, a strong hailstorm destroyed 10,000 houses in the city of Bag\u00e9 alone at the time. The diocese managed to collect funds and donations and helped 2,000 families.\n\nNow, churches all over the state are operating as centers of distribution of donations and as shelters for displaced people, Dalbosco said.\n\n\"There's an overspread feeling of solidarity and volunteers are helping in every form the people in need,\" he said.\n\nIn his diocese, rains were weaker than those in other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, so only two cities are suffering with floods and devastation. Even so, parishioners have been working hard to collect food kits, clothes, and hygiene items, which are being sent to the most impacted regions, Dalbosco said.\n\n\"Parishes and dioceses from other parts of Brazil have been promoting campaigns and sending funds to our state as well,\" he added.\n\nBento Gon\u00e7alves was one of the cities heavily affected by the floods. After a dam broke due to the high volume of water, an entire district was inundated, causing deaths and devastating farms.\n\n\"With the roads destroyed, people were moving through trails amid grape vines in order to rescue the victims,\" Father Miguel Mosena told Crux. The region was populated by Italian immigrants and is notorious for the production of wine.\n\nLocal residents were waiting for help at higher locations, totally surrounded by water. Mosena said that all of them have already been rescued and are now in the houses of relatives or in the pastoral room of the church in the district of Faria Lemos.\n\n\"We are giving shelter to 60 of such families,\" Mosena added.\n\nIn the districts that were not so affected, people have been campaigning for help. Two days ago, five trucks full of donations left the city for the most devastated parts of the state.\n\n\"Now, the work of rebuilding the local roads is beginning, as well as the search for bodies. Yesterday, we buried two couples, people that were close members of our communities. But there are more,\" Mosena said.\n\nDespite the sadness, he said that \"many things of God are happening,\" something that he felt, for instance, when he saw the Church full of volunteers for Mass, people who had just come from rescue missions.\n\n\"There are reasons for keeping hope,\" Mosena said.\n\nIn several parts of Rio Grande do Sul, grocery stores have been announcing they are lacking basic food items, especially fresh vegetables, due to the devastation of farms and roads. That's the case in Caxias do Sul, the second largest city in the state, with more than 460,000 people.\n\nA couple of districts in the city were flooded and their residents had to be removed to other areas.\n\n\"We're giving shelter to a group of 25 senior citizens who lived at a nursing home,\" Father Leonardo Pereira told Crux.\n\nParishioners have been helping to rescue people from inundated areas with quadricycles and boats. Volunteers take food to people whose houses are surrounded by water.\n\n\"Our diocesan seminary became a center of distribution of donations. Yesterday, at least 500 people went there to help organize the kits,\" Pereira said.\n\nHis sister, who lives in Porto Alegre, the state capital city, and works as a nurse, told him that she had to leave the clinic where she takes care of patients after the water began to get into the place.\n\n\"A great part of Porto Alegre is now under water. Many people have no power, food, or gas,\" Pereira said.\n\nNow, 85 percent of the residents in Porto Alegre - which has a population of 1.5 million people - are lacking water. It may take several days for the normalization of the situation in the city, according to the authorities.\n\nOn the internet, videos show that armed men in boats are robbing displaced people and even volunteers that are taking part in rescue operations. Groups are getting into flooded shops and supermarkets and stealing the items they can.\n\nMany social media users have been saying over the past few days that the tragedy in Rio Grande do Sul is a punishment from God - either because it's a state with a large presence of centers of Umbanda (a Brazilian religion of African origin which is associated with the devil by fundamentalist Christians) or due to a mega concert of Madonna, which drew 1.5 million spectators on Copacabana Beach, in Rio de Janeiro, on Apr. 4 - they say the concert was a kind of diabolic ritual.\n\nBishop Cleonir Dalbosco said that, besides such distorted religious ideas, fake news of several kinds has been disturbing the rescue operations in the state.\n\n\"Opportunistic people are taking advantage of the victims of such tragedy in a moment of pain and suffering. Talking about a 'punishment of God' in a moment like that is something atrocious,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank God the Church has an immense credibility and people from all over the country are part of a solidarity alliance with us now in order to help so many victims,\" the bishop added.", "source": {"uri": "cruxnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crux"}, "authors": [{"uri":

One monitoring station in Porto Alegre, the state capital, recorded almost 260mm in three days -- equivalent to about two months' average rainfall.\n\nBrazil's air force has deployed Israeli-designed Hermes 900 reconnaissance drones, equipped with high definition cameras and sensors, which operate alongside helicopter teams to locate and rescue victims.\n\nVolunteers have joined the effort, including people trying to use surfboards and jet-skis to reach people in need of help.\n\nPorto Alegre, which is home to 1.3mn people, has been one of the places worst affected after the Gua\u00edba river broke its banks and flooded the city. The high point of the river reached 5.3 metres, far above a previous record of 4.76 metres in 1941.\n\nState governor Eduardo Leite has called for an aid programme resembling the Marshall Plan that followed the second world war to fix the damage, which he said would only truly become visible once the flood waters receded.\n\nOn Tuesday he warned of further bad weather, with a mass of cold air expected to bring more heavy rain and cause temperatures to drop sharply.\n\n\"It is already the worst climate disaster in our state, and we need to avoid loss of life at this time,\" he said last week.\n\nIn the past week, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has twice visited the state -- which is home to 11mn people -- promising federal aid to rebuild roads and bridges.\n\nEconomic damage is so far estimated at about $1bn, according to the National Confederation of Municipalities. Rio Grande do Sul is Brazil's fifth-largest state economy and is a key producer of agricultural products, as well as a centre for industry.\n\nThe state accounts for 70 per cent of national rice production, with 10 per cent expected to be lost because of the floods. Thirty per cent of the state's 21mn-tonne soyabean harvest is also expected to perish. Lula has said that Brazil will import rice and beans from abroad to prevent food shortages.\n\nThe disaster is the fourth such event to roil the state in the past year, following severe floods in July, September and November, which killed dozens.\n\nStark images from the disaster zone have galvanised a donations campaign across Brazil and abroad. On Tuesday, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the company would support relief efforts.\n\nPedro Luiz Cort\u00eas, professor of environmental science at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said the disaster was linked with climate change.\n\nA high pressure zone in the centre of Brazil was caused by abnormal warming in the Atlantic Ocean, he said. This was blocking cold fronts in the country's south and diverting maritime humidity southwards.\n\n\"Rio Grande do Sul is affected by three events that are fuelling the rains: the cold fronts, the humidity coming from the Atlantic and the high pressure dome,\" he said. \"These rains were caused by this meteorological phenomenon that is caused by climate change, because this warming of the Atlantic is not normal for this time of year.\"\n\nThe state and federal governments were ill-prepared for such climate emergencies, he added.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news",

The head of state also pledged to reduce the bureaucracy involved in the work.\n\n\"I know that the state has a difficult financial situation, I know that there are many roads with problems. I want to tell you that the federal government, through the Transport Ministry, will help you recover the state roads,\" said Lula in a speech after flying over the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, together with Speakers Arthur Lira (Lower House) and Rodrigo Pacheco (Senate) together with Federal Supreme Court (STF) Deputy Chief Justice Edson Fachin.\n\n\"Bureaucracy will not stand in the way of us recovering the greatness of this state,\" said Lula, who also called for public authorities to act preventively from now on to reduce the impact of extreme weather events. \"We need to stop chasing misfortune. We need to see in advance what could happen so that we can work,\" he added.\n\nLula made the statement after a meeting with Governor Eduardo Leite; Porto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo; and other mayors from Rio Grande do Sul. It was Lula's second trip to Rio Grande do Sul since the floods began. On Thursday, he met with Leite in Santa Maria to have a first-hand impression of the ongoing calamity.\n\nLeite insisted that the state was going through the biggest climate catastrophe in history and warned of the risk of shortages and collapse in several areas, due to the closure of Salgado Filho Airport, the blockages and destruction of highways and the lack of energy and water in several locations. Once the victims have been rescued, the authorities will focus on reactivating the state's industry, he also explained.\n\n\"We're monitoring the impact on production chains, because the animals aren't arriving, the slaughterhouse was also hit, collapsed. This naturally affects the lives of the workers, but there is also a question of supply. So action will have to be taken in this area. The impact on industry, due to supplies that won't arrive, or the companies that supply and have been hit, stoppages in industrial plants, which will require economic measures,\" said the governor.\n\nMelo called for the rapid arrival of resources to the municipalities so that reconstruction work can begin as soon as possible. In the state capital itself, he pointed out, there is a lack of equipment to deal with a climate tragedy on this scale. According to him, the problem is even more serious in the interior of the state. \"There is a shortage of boats, dinghies and vests in the city. I'm talking about my city, but this extends to dozens of municipalities and it can't wait. It has to happen today, it has to happen now\", said Melo. The mayor pointed out that 70% of the city is without water and that there is a shortage of diesel for the water trucks and oxygen for the hospitals, but said that, right now, the public authorities need to focus on saving lives.\n\nThe Federal Government has deployed some 900 troops, 30 helicopters, and various drones, 866 vehicles, 182 boats and 85 pieces of engineering equipment, in addition to 734 people from the Justice Ministry (319 Federal Police officers, 315 others from the Federal Highway Police, and 100 from the National Security Force), of whom 60 are firefighters.\n\nLira and Pacheco said they would work to get the National Congress to draw up a package of actions to reduce bureaucracy and extend financial aid to the state. \"We have a responsibility this week to discuss a course of action so that we can draw up a totally extraordinary measure,\" said Lira while Pacheco promised to try to reduce bureaucracy as much as possible to help rebuild the state. He also recalled Congress' experience in legislating under extraordinary circumstances, citing the constitutional amendment passed during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"There are no limitations, there are no legal restrictions from ordinary times. There is a need to take bureaucracy, obstacles and limitations off the shelf and off the table so that Rio Grande do Sul doesn't lack anything to rebuild. We did this during the pandemic with great courage in the National Congress with a proposed amendment to the constitution that we called the War PEC, with numerous exceptional legislative measures,\" said Pacheco.\n\nMeanwhile, Fachin said the court would create a \"special and transitional\" legal regime for Rio Grande do Sul. \"We are here to express more than our solidarity, we are here together, the Judiciary is together with the other branches of the Republic and will be together especially in the perspective of adopting a special emergency and transitional legal regime for the environmental catastrophe in Rio Grande do Sul,\" he stressed.", "source": {"uri": "en.mercopress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MercoPress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil, along with his cabinet visited the state on Sunday to assess the damage and help the government's responses. He told reports it is the worst flooding that has hit the country.\n\nThe Rio Grande do Sul state, that is the most affected by the flooding, is where most of Brazil's grains are produced. Experts in Brazil say it will likely affect supply globally because it is an important commodity.\n\nAccording to Jorge de Souza, technical and project manager at the Brazilian Fruit Growers and Exporters Association (ABRAFRUTAS), fruit production in the affected Rio Grande do Sul state is unaffected by the flooding. \"I confirm there are no undesirable effects on fruit production because Rio Grande do Sul State produces apples in the North, relatively far away from the points where flooding has been serious, basic along the rivers that cross the State. There were no negative effects on fruit production, because the harvest has already been done and apples are stored safely. We have only some roads where traffic has been more difficult, but with no negative effect on distribution due to alternative routes.\"\n\nFlooding leads to 30% export fruit losses in Petrolina\n\nIn another city Petrolina, a municipality located in the southernmost point of the state of Pernambuco, in Northeast Brazil, in the valley of the S\u00e3o Francisco River, rain and wind damage has also been reported on export fruit. Renata Alves, a grape grower in the city of Petrolina, where mangoes are also grown, said they have had significant losses due to the rain and strong winds. \"The rains in Petrolina were strong, and we have significant losses, around 30% in quantity and around 80% in the conditions for exportation. In other words, out of the losses, 80% of the fruits had no condition for exportation, so we just left the fruit in the local market.\"\n\nDe Souza warns that the climate is increasingly becoming unpredictable, making fresh produce production very challenging for growers in Brazil and around the world. \"The only question we have is: How often those heavy rains / drought conditions will occur in the future and where? We have observed several climate disasters all over the world and the future shows a lot of energy about that!\"", "source": {"uri": "agroinsurance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "agroinsurance.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Brazil", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Gua\u00edba", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Gua\u00edba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Brazil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petrolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Petrolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federative_units_of_Brazil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federative units of Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dani Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e3o_Francisco_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Francisco River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pernambuco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pernambuco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The proposals entail an impact of 7.7 billion reais on this year's primary budget result, which excludes interest payments, he said.\n\nTorrential rains in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul have left at least 107 people dead and 165,000 displaced, setting up a defining moment in Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidency.

He said officials will only have a full understanding of the damage once the water recedes.\n\nFinancial markets have become increasingly concerned in recent weeks that the government is backing off pledges to limit deficits and strengthen public accounts.

The limited fruit production of mainly apples is said to be unaffected, while the rain continues to fall in the affected southern Rio Grande do Sul state. Rescue efforts by the different levels of the Brazilian government is ongoing.\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil, in a flyover yesterday to assess the flooding damage. (Office of the President of Brasil)\n\nPart of a dam wall at a hydroelectric power plant burst its banks last Thursday, leaving over half a million people without power. Dramatic scenes of people waiting on their rooftops to be rescued from high water levels unfolded over the weekend.\n\nIn the most affected Rio Grande do Sul state, which borders Uruguay and Argentina, a state of emergency has been declared. In the state's capital city, Porto Alegre, where the Gua\u00edba River bank broke, led to flooding of the streets. Most of the state's 497 cities have been hit by storms leading to widespread flooding, collapse bridged, burst river banks and flooded streets. This led to the huge amount of displaced people. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil, along with his cabinet visited the state on Sunday to assess the damage and help the government's responses. He told reports it is the worst flooding that has hit the country.\n\nThe Rio Grande do Sul state, that is the most affected by the flooding, is where most of Brazil's grains are produced. Experts in Brazil say it will likely affect supply globally because it is an important commodity.\n\nAccording to Jorge de Souza, technical and project manager at the Brazilian Fruit Growers and Exporters Association (ABRAFRUTAS), fruit production in the affected Rio Grande do Sul state is unaffected by the flooding. \"I confirm there are no undesirable effects on fruit production because Rio Grande do Sul State produces apples in the North, relatively far away from the points where flooding has been serious, basic along the rivers that cross the State. There were no negative effects on fruit production, because the harvest has already been done and apples are stored safely. We have only some roads where traffic has been more difficult, but with no negative effect on distribution due to alternative routes.\"\n\nFlooding leads to 30% export fruit losses in Petrolina\n\nIn another city Petrolina, a municipality located in the southernmost point of the state of Pernambuco, in Northeast Brazil, in the valley of the S\u00e3o Francisco River, rain and wind damage has also been reported on export fruit. Renata Alves, a grape grower in the city of Petrolina, where mangoes are also grown, said they have had significant losses due to the rain and strong winds. \"The rains in Petrolina were strong, and we have significant losses, around 30% in quantity and around 80% in the conditions for exportation. In other words, out of the losses, 80% of the fruits had no condition for exportation, so we just left the fruit in the local market.\"\n\nDe Souza warns that the climate is increasingly becoming unpredictable, making fresh produce production very challenging for growers in Brazil and around the world. \"The only question we have is: How often those heavy rains / drought conditions will occur in the future and where? We have observed several climate disasters all over the world and the future shows a lot of energy about that!\"\n\nFor more information:\n\nJorge de Souza\n\nAbrafrutas\n\nTel: +55 38999

The damage has extended to key products like rice, poultry, pork and soy in a region that serves as one of Brazil's agricultural powerhouses, causing concerns of crop losses and food shortages in the area.\n\nPlanning Minister Simone Tebet told reporters that the government could not estimate the overall spending need for the flood response, but that it would maintain its fiscal target for 2024.\n\nEarlier on Monday, the crisis caused swap rates to rise amid worries \"about the possible inflationary impact it could generate,\" said Daniel Leal, a fixed income strategist at the brokerage BGC Liquidez.\n\nThe rampant floods are expected to dent rice and soy harvests that are each only about 80% complete. Datagro, a Sao Paulo-based agricultural consultancy, forecasts that the state will lose 600,000 to 700,000 tons in rice -- about 8% to 9% of its annual production forecast -- and 1% of Brazil's estimated soy production.\n\n\"So far, the effect of the flooding was concentrated in rice prices that jumped 5% in the last seven days,\" JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts said in a note, adding that the overall inflation risks of the flooding are likely to be \"modest.\"\n\nTen meatpacking plants in the state suspended operations, according to ABPA, which represents the poultry and pork industries. BRF SA, the country's biggest poultry producer, said in text message Monday that four of its five plants in Rio Grande do Sul have resumed operations, with the fifth likely to reopen Tuesday.\n\n\"With the temporary shutdown of plants that account for most of the state's chicken and pork production, there are fears that the population of Rio Grande do Sul will face a shortage of products until the production system is restored, which could take more than 30 days,\" ABPA said in a Monday statement.\n\nThe agriculture ministry said last week that the government will allow farmers affected by climate events to renegotiate loan debts related to investment credit lines with Brazil's national development bank, a benefit it typically only offers at the end of the harvest season.\n\nThe large volume of rain that caused the floods in southern Brazil resulted from an atmospheric blockage in the central region of the country and a mass of polar air that came from Argentina and Uruguay, all in addition to El Nin\u00f5, which naturally increases the amount of precipitation in the region, said Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agrometeorologist at Rural Clima.\n\nRead More: Lula Visits Southern Brazil With Dozens Missing in Floods\n\nThe city of Santa Maria, one of at least 364 municipalities affected by flooding in Rio Grande do Sul, received 408 millimeters (16.1 inches) of rain in April, roughly three times the average of 151.1 millimeters for the month.\n\nThe death toll from the floods continues to rise each day and more than 111 people are still missing, according to the state's civil defense department. Another 20,000 are in shelters and a total of 129,279 are displaced. The impact on both the population and the state's agricultural industry may only grow larger in the coming days, with rains forecast to continue.\n\n\"The situation is chaotic and will have a general impact on Brazil's economy,\" Santos said.\n\n--With assistance from Guilherme Bento, Felipe Saturnino, Daniel Carvalho, Martha Beck and Maria Eloisa Capurro.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca",

More rain was expected on Tuesday night, further obstructing recovery efforts that have already been slow due to the overwhelming need for shelter, food, hygiene products, and other essentials.\n\nIt's estimated that the floods have displaced more than 150,000 people from their homes, with an additional 50,000 residents living in schools, gymnasiums and other temporary shelters, The Associated Press reported. With overnight temperatures dipping into the 50s, and not enough blankets to go around, the population now faces the possibility of widespread hypothermia.\n\nAccess to safe drinking water in the state's capital city of Porto Alegre is also a problem, with around 80 percent of the city lacking running water due to the floods.\n\nThe rain totals over the past week have equaled close to 70 percent of what the region typically sees in the entire month of April. The flooding is the worst Brazil has seen in the past 80 years, and continued storms hitting the region are going to make things \"much worse,\" Gov. Eduardo Leite said on Friday.\n\nMore than 265 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul have been affected by the floods. In addition to deaths and displacement, 350,000 people have experienced at least some form of property damage.\n\nThe flooding is likely to affect the rest of the country, particularly when it comes to food supplies, as Rio Grande do Sul produces around 70 percent of rice for Brazil.\n\nSeveral scientists have stated outright that two factors are to blame for the floods -- the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a weather patterns for this year, and the effects of human-made global climate change.\n\nClimatologist Francisco Eliseu Aquino has described the two factors as creating a \"disastrous cocktail.\" Brazilian climate activist Bruon Brezenski has described the devastation wrought by the storms as \"a war scene.\"\n\n\"Of the recent global catastrophes, this is undoubtedly one of the worst,\" Brezenski said on X.\n\n\"Unprecedented flooding in Brazil is another reminder that climate change is an issue now, not just for future generations,\" said Isaias Hernandez, an environmental educator and founder of QueerBrownVegan.\n\nB\u00e1rbara Calegari, an evolutionary biologist who was born in Rio Grande do Sul, shared an image of some of the destruction, noting that the floods were clearly more destructive due to climate change.\n\n\"This is my hometown in Brazil, submerged by heavy rain. It is absolutely drastic the situation in my State, several people died and many others lost their houses,\" Calegari said, adding that it was unbelievable that \"some people still don't believe in climate change.\"\n\nLuiza Karpavicius, a Brazilian-born environmental and climate economics Ph.D student at Aarhus University in Denmark, also commented on the flooding.\n\n\"The era of extreme climate effects is here,\" Karpavicius said. \"It's important to remember that the most affected will continually be the more vulnerable populations, who have historically contributed the least to climate change.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_walker@truthout.org", "name": "Chris Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federative_units_of_Brazil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federative units of Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnasium (school)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypothermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarhus_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aarhus University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evolutionary biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/05/2024_0508-brazil-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Roads have turned to muddy rivers, and vast fields are brown with floodwaters.\n\nAt the Salgado Filho International Airport in the capital, the runways and roads are entirely submerged -- only buildings remain above water.\n\nThe record rainfall has been linked to El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon that warms waters in the Pacific and tends to bring heavy rainfall to southern Brazil. Long-term global warming caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels has also exacerbated extreme weather in the region.\n\nRio Grande do Sul -- Brazil's southernmost state, and until recently a tranquil agricultural region -- has seen repeatedly extreme weather events in recent years.\n\nIn the capital's central area, the Gremio Arena football stadium, which seats 55,000 people, is surrounded by floodwaters, its pitch entirely submerged.\n\nThe Brazilian Football Confederation postponed matches involving teams from Rio Grande do Sul until May 27. Brazilian football star Neymar Jr. posted on Instagram an image of a plane parked alongside pallets of supplies, including bottled water, which he said was from himself and his father.\n\nHe wrote: \"Our Brazil is going through a difficult time and helping is NEVER too much, regardless of your financial situation, what matters is what you carry in your heart.\"\n\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva sent Congress a legislative decree to speed up the transfer of resources to the area on Tuesday.\n\nMore than 46,000 people have been rescued from the waters in a mass operation involving some 15,000 personnel, the federal government said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It says: \"More than half of the 497 cities in the state have been affected by the storms, with roads and bridges destroyed in several areas. The storms also caused landslides and the collapse of a hydroelectric dam near the city of Bento Gon\u00e7alves, killing 30 people. A second dam in the area was also at risk of collapsing due to rising water levels, authorities said.\" The Guardian reports that 75 people have died and more than 100 are still missing. It adds that more than a million people lack access to drinking water. The state governor, Eduardo Leite, posted on social media that \"the current event will be the worst climate disaster that our state ever faced\", the outlet adds. The i newspaper says a \"state of emergency\" has been declared in southern Brazil. The Associated Press adds: \"It was the fourth such environmental disaster in a year, following floods in July, September and November 2023 that killed 75 people in total. The flooding statewide has surpassed that seen during a historic 1941 deluge.\" Agence France-Presse adds that the Guaiba River, which flows through the city of 1.4 million people, reached a record high level of 5.3 metres. According to Reuters, more than 69,000 people have been displaced due to the storms. Al Jazeera says: \"Residents in several cities and towns have been left completely cut off from the world, with no electricity or telephone access, while others have been forced to abandon their livestock.\" Semafor calls the flooding the \"worst disaster\" in the last 80 years, noting that \"the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul received more than 70% of all the rain it typically gets in the month of April in the space of four days\". It adds: \"Experts point to climate change and this year's juiced El Ni\u00f1o-La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern as the likely driver - with deadly consequences.\" The Washington Post covers the reaction of Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. It says: \"[Lula] told senior congressional and judicial officials that the country needed to change its approach to climate-driven disasters. He called for a national plan to prevent 'climatic accidents' and directed top environmental lieutenant Marina Silva to begin forming a strategy. 'We have to stop just running after disaster,' Lula said. 'We have to start preparing for what can happen from disasters.' In a comment provided exclusively to the Washington Post, Lula blamed the devastation in Rio Grande do Sul on the failures of the global community to respond to climate change. He said there was a 'historic debt.' Poorer countries that have historically emitted few greenhouse gases, he said, are suffering from the pollution of wealthier nations.\" The Daily Mail and EuroNews also cover the story.\n\nElsewhere, the Financial Times reports that flooding in Kenya has killed more than 200 people and displaced around 160,000. The paper quotes Kenyan president William Ruto: \"Ruto warned that 'we've not seen the end' of the rain linked to the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, as he predicted it would increase 'in duration and intensity for the rest of this month and possibly after'. He added: 'The current unprecedented crisis of floods...is a direct consequence of our failure to protect our environment, resulting in the painful effects of climate change we are witnessing today. Our country is poised to remain in this cyclical crisis for a long time unless and until we confront the existential threat of climate change.'\" The paper also quotes Raila Odinga, leader of the Kenyan opposition, who said that \"the government has been talking big on climate change, yet when the menace comes in full force, we have been caught unprepared\".", "source": {"uri":

He made two trips to the state, aiming to assess the heavy rains' impacts and collaborate with the governor and mayors on essential measures to aid the affected population.\n\nAccording to the State Government's latest bulletin issued this Tuesday, May 7, the number of municipalities affected by the heavy rains has risen to 397, impacting 1,408,993 people. The state reports 156,056 displaced individuals, with 48,297 in shelter, amid 90 fatalities, 362 individuals injured, and 131 reported missing.\n\nThe Federal Government led a comprehensive mobilization effort, coordinating with ministries, the Armed Forces, and Civil Defense, in collaboration with state and municipal authorities. On the humanitarian front, President Lula conveyed a message of support, assuring affected families that they are not alone in facing their challenges. In addressing environmental concerns, emphasis was placed on the need for Brazil to better prepare for climate change and extreme weather events.\n\n\"There will be no shortage of assistance from the Federal Government to address healthcare needs. Adequate funding will be allocated for transportation and for ensuring access to food. The Federal Government, whether through its ministers, collaborating with civil society, or with the aid of our military, is committed to working around the clock to meet the basic needs of those who are isolated,\" assured the president at the outset of May.\n\nIn the ongoing Operation Taquari 2, coordinated by the Armed Forces, more than 46,000 individuals have been rescued with the efforts of over 15,000 military personnel, police officers, and agents. The operation's logistics utilize 42 aircraft, 243 vessels, and 2,500 vehicles and engineering equipment. However, logistical efforts face challenges due to 158 roadblocks across the state. The Armed Forces are also actively engaged in transporting kerosene by sea and river to refuel aircraft and vessels.\n\nSITUATION ROOM - The Brazilian government has set up a situation room at the Planalto Palace to centralize information and coordinate initiatives aimed at assisting families affected by the heavy rains in Rio Grande do Sul. Saving lives and rescuing people are currently the top priorities of federal, state, and municipal actions.\n\nMinister Paulo Pimenta, of the Social Communication Secretariat (SECOM) within the Presidency of the Republic, has been overseeing the task force operations in the Southern state since last week. \"Our primary focus at this time is on rescue activities,\" he stated. The Minister further noted that this directive aligns with the President's mandate, ensuring \"that resources and personnel remain abundantly available.\"\n\nDuring her visit to Rio Grande do Sul last week, Minister of the Environment Marina Silva proposed the implementation of a \"permanent state of climate emergency\". This initiative aims to empower at-risk municipalities -- those frequently exposed to extreme weather events -- to take proactive measures in preventing tragedies and assisting affected populations. Such efforts would be conducted in close collaboration with federal and state governments. Minister Silva referenced President Lula's directive at the inception of the current mandate, emphasizing the dual focus on disaster management and prevention.\n\nHUMANITARIAN AID -- In response to the meteorological catastrophe, Pimenta emphasized the mobilization of equipment, personnel, and emergency resources to mitigate the devastating impacts of the rains. To optimize the logistics of the humanitarian effort, each Brazilian state is consolidating local donations for those affected in Rio Grande do Sul. This coordination will be managed by the Secretariat of Institutional Affairs, with support from the Social Communication Secretariat (SECOM) and the Chief of Staff's Office.\n\nThe proposal recommends consolidating donations at Fire Department units within each state. After the donations are sorted at the state level, they will be transported to the Gale\u00e3o Air Base (in Rio de Janeiro) and Guarulhos Air Base (in S\u00e3o Paulo).\n\nFor comprehensive information

Click here for the full Reuters report.\n\n* Chinese provinces are urging companies to offer women flexible job roles called \"Mama's Posts\" that make it easier to balance work and childcare, the official Xinhua news agency said. Authorities are trying to encourage more women to have children after China's population fell for a second consecutive year in 2023 and births touched a record low.\n\n* Three of the biggest global health funders have joined forces for the first time in a $300 million partnership aimed at tackling the linked impacts of climate change, malnutrition, and infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.\n\n* Corporate governance: Berkshire Hathaway shareholders overwhelmingly rejected six proposals addressing environmental and social policy issues at Warren Buffett's conglomerate, all of which the billionaire investor and his board opposed.\n\n* Journalists at Italian state broadcaster RAI staged a one-day strike on Monday, accusing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government of stifling free speech. Heavy-handed political influence over RAI is a long-standing issue in Italy, but the journalists' union Usigrai says the situation has worsened since Meloni took office in late 2022.\n\n* LGBT rights: Aetna will pay $2 million and update its coverage policies to settle a lawsuit claiming the health insurer required LGBTQ beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket for fertility treatments than heterosexual people, according to a Friday court filing.\n\nIn Conversation\n\nFriends of the Earth lawyer, Katie de Kauwe, shares her thoughts on the UK's High Court finding the government's new\n\n\"This is another embarrassing defeat for the government and its reckless and inadequate climate plans.\n\n\"It shows the strength of the Climate Change Act - brought into force after a successful campaign led by Friends of the Earth and the backing of an overwhelming majority of MPs - to hold the government of the day to account for meeting its legal requirements to cut emissions.\n\n\"We've all been badly let down by a government that's failed, not once but twice, to deliver a climate plan that ensures both our legally binding national targets and our international commitment to cut emissions by over two thirds by 2030 are met.\n\n\"Cutting emissions isn't only essential to avert the worst of climate breakdown, it will create long term jobs in green industries of the future, boost energy security, bring down our bills and end our reliance on costly fossil fuels.\n\n\"We urgently need a credible and lawful new action plan that puts our climate goals back on track and ensures we all benefit from a fair transition to a sustainable future. Meeting our domestic and international carbon reduction targets must be a top priority for whichever party wins the next general election.\"\n\nESG Spotlight\n\nFrom earthquake warning apps in Taiwan to eco-villages in Hungary, today's spotlight focuses on future-proofing initiatives amid extreme weather and climate change.\n\nEarthquake warning smartphone apps have surged in popularity in Taiwan due to high demand from people eager to get a few extra seconds to take cover after more than 1,300 aftershocks rattled the island in the past month following a large temblor.\n\nTaiwan's east coast was struck by a 7.2 magnitude quake on April 3, killing 17 people. The frequent aftershocks since then - including more than 200 tremors in a 24-hour period starting April 22 - have unnerved many.\n\nWhile the government has an automated quake warning system, sent in the form of a text message accompanied by a loud alert sound meant to sound a few seconds before the shaking starts, it can be patchy. In the capital Taipei it did not sound before the April 3 quake, prompting criticism of the system.\n\nThat, along with the rising demand to stay more informed about forthcoming earthquakes, have helped a surge in popularity in privately-developed quake warning apps.\n\nOver in Hungary, Laszlo Kemencei lives as sustainably as possible on his small farm in the eastern region of the nation. He believes the land is effectively borrowed from his young daughter, so he must do all he can to preserve it for the future.\n\nKemencei, 28, wife Cintia and Boroka, almost 2, moved to the farm outside Ladanybene three years ago. They keep horses, pigs and chickens on an area of 4.5 hectares (11 acres), which they partly lease for grazing.\n\n\"This land, we have not inherited from our fathers, but we have it on a lease from our children ... so we try to live and farm the land in a sustainable way,\" he says, sitting in their cozy kitchen where a chunk of pork sizzles in the oven.\n\nWhile there are no statistics on how many families are following a similar lifestyle in Hungary - part of their choice is not necessarily to engage with central institutions - anecdotal evidence suggests it is a growing trend.\n\nSome want to rein in the costs of living, while for others it is to escape a consumer-driven society or live a more environmentally friendly life.\n\nKemencei estimates there are around 1,000 families trying to embrace some form of sustainability, either alone or as part of more structured eco-villages.\n\nToday's Sustainable Switch was edited by Christina Fincher\n\nThink your friend or colleague should know about us?

Floodwater inundated the historic district, caused the international airport to close, swept through major stadiums, and left several highways impassable.\n\nThe MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites acquired these images (below) on April 20 and May 6, before and during the flooding. Water overtopped the banks of the Jacu\u00ed, Cai, and Sinos rivers, inundating parts of Porto Alegre, the state's capital city. Floodwater also spilled into several other cities, towns, and farmland upriver. Runoff, stained brown with suspended sediment, is visible flowing into the Patos Lagoon, south of Porto Alegre.\n\nThe flooding caused havoc throughout Rio Grande do Sul state. More than 160,000 people have been displaced, and scores of people have died, according to Rio Grande do Sul's agency for civil defense. The state is a major producer and exporter of soy, rice, wheat, and meat. Farmers are already reporting extensive damage in several areas, and analysts expect that damage to silos and other storage facilities, transportation networks, and ports will disrupt grain exports.\n\nAccording to Brazil's National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the weakening El Ni\u00f1o contributed to the region's extreme rains by helping steer cold fronts toward Rio Grande do Sul and concentrating atmospheric instability over the state. Unusually warm water in the South Atlantic Ocean boosted humidity levels, setting up a collision between warm, humid air from the Amazon and colder air to the south of the state that strengthened the storms, INMET said.\n\nThe extreme rainfall fits a broader pattern of change that climate scientists expect to see in this region due to the rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This part of South America is projected to see significant increases in annual precipitation totals and annual 5-day precipitation maximums by 2050, according to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The projections are based on simulations from the CMIP-6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) multi-model ensemble, a project that incorporates modeling results from the GISS ModelE, a general circulation model developed by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\n\nNASA's Earth Applied Sciences Disasters program area has been activated to support partners responding to the event. The team is using satellite data to map landslides and identify regions without power. As new information becomes available, the team will be posting maps and data products on its open-access mapping portal. Among them is NASA's MODIS Near Real-Time Global Flood product, which showed extensive flooding in and around the city on May 6, 2024 (above).", "source": {"uri": "earthobservatory.nasa.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASA Earth Observatory"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate_Resolution_Imaging_Spectroradiometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_8", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landsat 8"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(satellite)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terra (satellite)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(satellite)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aqua (satellite)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoa_dos_Patos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lagoa dos Patos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_front", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sediment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soybean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/152000/152795/portoalegre_oli_20240508_th.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "dateEnd": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 714, "textEnd": 732}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

More than two-thirds of the almost 500 cities in the state have been impacted, leaving over 100,000 people displaced.\n\n\"It's really an unprecedented natural disaster here for this region,\" said Luke Zinger, who lives in the state's capital city, Porto Alegre. \"It's not like Winnipeg where we get seasonal flooding, they get seasonal rains. It's common to have rains this time of year, but this level of disruption and just excessive water is completely out of the ordinary for them.\"\n\nThe city is situated on a large river called the Guaiba, Zinger said. And as heavy rains continued through the weekend, the water levels began to rise to dangerous and destructive levels.\n\n\"There was just water in places that you would have never imagined water being there and it was rising. Lots of military presence, lots of helicopters,\" he said.\n\n\"There were boats coming back and forth just rescuing people.\"\n\nZinger, who has been living in Brazil for about five years, left his apartment in the city's central area Monday afternoon, after the power and water in the building had gone out and the building's first floor started to take on water. People at the building were putting down sandbags when he got a message from his friend that he had water and electricity and Zinger could stay there.\n\nHe stuffed some clothes, his passport and laptop into a bag and made an hour-and-a-half walk down the main thoroughfare there to catch a bus. While there wasn't any panic, traffic was congested, sirens wailed and police were guiding boats to where they'd be able to rescue people.\n\n\"You imagine apocalyptic scenes right, with all these helicopters and sirens and everyone's bumper-to-bumper traffic trying to escape something,\" he said. \"Then you see the water, you see the water just rising and it was just coming and rising all day.\"\n\nWhile Zinger has found safe refuge in the northern area of Porto Alegre, he knows not all are as lucky.\n\nThere are dozens dead and many are missing. Thousands are in shelters, thousands more are displaced plus there's a lack of drinking water and food.\n\nAnd the rebuilding efforts that will come in the wake of the flooding will be \"insane,\" Zinger said.\n\n\"You're going to talk about trying to rebuild whole cities and highways and bridges and complete infrastructure of a region that has millions of people,\" he said.\n\nMore severe rain was also forecasted to start Tuesday night in the southern part of the state, according to the National Meteorological Institute. Rainfall could exceed 150 millimetres or about nearly six inches by early Wednesday.\n\nThe drop in temperature has also caused concern among authorities there about hypothermia.\n\nMeanwhile, Zinger hopes the rest of the world will lend a hand to his adopted home.\n\n\"Whole areas are destroyed and we have a loss of life, it's going to get worse before it gets better and it's just really sad and scary and it's really hard to think about all of our neighbours here that have lost everything,\" said Zinger.\n\n\"Obviously Brazil is not as wealthy as Canada as a country and it's really hard for a lot of people financially to repair and put everything together and they just lost their entire home, so it's going to be really difficult and we're going to need a lot of help down here.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(alarm)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siren (alarm)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypothermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7197414.1715138839!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/brazil-heavy-rains.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540542", "eventUri": "eng-9540542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

With approximately four-fifths of the population currently without access to running water, the situation remains dire, compounded by the loss of at least 90 lives and over 130 individuals still missing.\n\nEfforts to rescue those stranded by the floods in the state of Rio Grande do Sul persist, while forecasts predict further rainfall in the coming week, exacerbating the challenges faced by affected communities. Porto Alegre, the state capital, has found itself virtually isolated, with key transportation hubs such as the airport and bus station shuttered and major roads impassable due to floodwaters.\n\nMany have been forced to abandon their homes\n\nResidents like Maria Vit\u00f3ria Jorge have been forced to abandon their homes in search of basic necessities. According to a report from AP, Jorge, a yoga teacher, withdrew funds from her savings to secure temporary accommodation for herself and her family after her apartment in downtown Porto Alegre became submerged.\n\n\"I can't shower at home, wash the dishes or even have drinkable water,\" Jorge lamented as she prepared to relocate. \"I had just a gallon of water for the 200-kilometer drive to the city of Torres, so far unaffected by the floods.\"\n\nMost water treatment facilities are out of commission\n\nPorto Alegre Mayor Sebasti\u00e3o Melo emphasized the gravity of the situation, declaring water usage strictly for \"essential consumption\" and arranging for distribution points where residents can collect bottled water. However, with the majority of water treatment facilities out of commission, access to clean water remains a pressing concern.\n\nIn addition to water scarcity, shortages of food and personal hygiene products are exacerbating the crisis, prompting neighboring states to mobilize relief efforts. Supermarkets in Porto Alegre are reportedly grappling with long queues and dwindling supplies, with rationing measures implemented on essential items like bottled water.\n\nThreat of dengue is high\n\nPublic health experts warn of the looming threat of disease outbreaks, particularly dengue fever and leptospirosis, amidst widespread flooding.\n\nAs residents grapple with the aftermath of the disaster, many are seeking refuge outside of Porto Alegre, although access routes remain impassable.

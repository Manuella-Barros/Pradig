Dr Paul van der Westhuizen, men's health lead for home health test provider Medichecks, has issued a message to blokes about their hormone health. He's urging men to become more aware of their hormone levels during Alcohol Awareness Week, which runs from July 1. One particular tipple, he says, can throw their hormone balance out of whack. Excessive amounts of the 'female hormone' oestrogen can fool the brain into believing it has an overabundance of testosterone, leading the body to cut back on its production. This could result in symptoms such as low mood and energy, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. Moreover, changes in our food chain and environment have increased the risk of absorbing additional oestrogen from external sources. Dr van der Westhuizen explained: \"While we typically label hormones as male or female, the fact is men and women make both types of hormones in different levels. The different volumes of these hormones are what distinguishes the sexual characteristics of men and women. \"Oestrogen is the collective name for a group of hormones which are mainly responsible for developing the female reproductive system, but men also produce oestrogen in small amounts. Oestradiol is the strongest of these and in men it's responsible for regulating libido, erectile function, and sperm production. \"Oestradiol levels in men can be raised due to excess body fat, or linked to an age-related decline in testosterone. High levels of oestrogen in men can cause a negative feedback loop in the brain, causing it to think the body has too much testosterone and lowering its testosterone production in response. \"High and low oestrogen levels are relatively rare in healthy men, but they could be on the rise. It's recently come to light that changes in the food chain and our environment has upped the risk of exogenous (or external) oestrogens entering the body and raising oestrogen levels with alcohol, and especially beer, being a key source. \"We all know alcohol can have profound effects on the body, but especially the hormones - it can decrease testosterone levels and encourage the body to turn testosterone into oestrogen. Alcohol also contributes to higher body fat through its own calorie content, and unhealthy eating behaviours associated with drinking. The resulting 'beer belly' also encourages the body to turn testosterone into oestrogen, doubling up on the negative effects. \"Symptoms of raised oestrogen levels include loss of libido, infertility, and excess growth of breast tissue; the so-called 'man boobs'. If you're experiencing these symptoms, a testosterone and oestradiol blood test can be a good way to see if your hormones are out of balance.\"", "summary": "Dr Paul van der Westhuizen has urged men to get savvy about their hormone levels", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/doctor-warns-men-do-one-33126407", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33101518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Barmans-arms-pulling-a-pint-of-beer.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:22:25", "author": "Steven Smith,Steven-Smith", "authors": ["Steven Smith", "Steven-Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.035}

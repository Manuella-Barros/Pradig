The administration will expand access to the Temporary Protected Status program to Haitians through February 2026 due to violence and security issues in Haiti that limit access to safety, healthcare, food and water, the department said.

U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another term in Nov. 5 elections, has walked a political tightrope when it comes to immigration, trying to step up security at the U.S.-Mexico border while also taking a more humane approach to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

The TPS program offers deportation relief and work permits to people in the U.S. whose home countries face armed conflict, natural disasters and other extraordinary events. The designations last six to 18 months but frequently are renewed.

GOWON AKPODONOR writes that while the International Olympics Committee (IOC) and some stakeholders are opposed to the move, others believe that it would bring out the best in athletes. When innovation meets time-tested tradition,...\n\nThe World Athletics' decision to reward each gold medallist at the forthcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games with $50,000 has generated mixed reactions from the sporting world. GOWON AKPODONOR writes that while the International Olympics Committee (IOC) and some stakeholders are opposed to the move, others believe that it would bring out the best in athletes.\n\nWhen innovation meets time-tested tradition, what gives? What impact would the recent World Athletics' decision to reward every gold medal at the Paris Olympics Games with $50,000 have on the amateur status of the Games?\n\nThese posers and many others perhaps prompted stakeholders in world sports to rise up against what they believe will bastardise their sector and lead many to adopt unsavoury means to win gold medals at the world's biggest sporting extravaganza.\n\nWorld Athletics (WA) the international athletics ruling body's recent announcement that it would pay $50,000 to gold medalists in Paris, made it the first sport to introduce cash prizes at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nAdditionally, WA said relay teams would be granted $50,000 as a collective, to be divided among their members.\n\nPresident of World Athletics, Sebastian Coe's announcement is a symbolic break with the amateur past of the Olympic Games in one of the most important events.\n\nAlthough amateurism, in its real sense, has become a thing of the past as superstars with multi-million dollar contracts have competed in the Games for decades, Coe's idea is seen by many as taking liberty too far, as, according to some, it would lead to unfair competition and also make it impossible for fair competition.\n\nOne of the earliest opposition to the plan came from none other than the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which said its role is to level the playing field and reduce the gap between the powerhouses and the rest.\n\nPresident of the IOC, Thomas Bach, advised international sports federations like track and field to focus on reducing inequalities between countries, not on handing out prizes to winners.\n\n\"International federations must treat all their member-federations and their athletes equally, and try to close the gap between the privileged and the less privileged, or underprivileged,\" the German said.\n\nHe advised Coe and other federation presidents to leave rewards for excellent athletes to their home countries, saying that National Olympic Committees (NOCs) should be the ones to freely decide on athlete prizes as motivation, not the international federations.\n\nHowever, while Coe's plan has been rejected by the IOC and some other stakeholders, it has been well-received by some prominent athletes.\n\nOn its part, the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) said that WA's position \"undermines the values of Olympism,\" and the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa described the move as \"contrary to the fundamental principles of the Olympic Movement.\"\n\nAlso opposing the move subtly is former Nigerian football captain, Segun Odegbami, who, however, failed to break ranks with the initiative completely.\n\nThe retired footballer would have made his Olympics debut at the botched Games in Montreal, Canada, about five decades ago, but featured at the Moscow 1980 edition of the Games.\n\nNow the proprietor of Sports Radio, Eagles '7, Odegbami, who is hoping to appear once more at the Paris 2024 Olympics Games, but not as an athlete, believes that current realities call for the type of change Coe is proposing.\n\nTo Odegbami, World Athletics' decision to pay $50,000 to gold medalists in the 48 track and field events may have defeated the earlier spirit of participation, but the present reality calls for it.\n\n\"Some years back, the Olympic Games was purely for amateur athletes and players,\" he told The Guardian.\n\n\"Then, no professionals were allowed to take part in the Games. Also at that time, every athlete who made it to the Olympics returned home with a medal, whether or not you made it to the podium. But things have changed, and we now have professional athletes and players competing at the Games. Giving financial rewards to an athlete at the Paris Olympics may be a result of the reality of the time. I won't speak against it,\" Odegbami stated.\n\nMary Onyali, the first Nigerian to compete at five Olympics after making consecutive appearances at the Olympics, from Seoul '88 Olympics, in South Korea, to the Athens 2004 Games, in Greece thinks that WA's decision to give $50,000 to gold medallists in Paris should be applauded.\n\nOnyali, whose feat at the Olympics was later equaled by table tennis players Bose Kaffo, and SegunToriola four years later in Beijing, China, became the first African woman to win an Olympic medal at Atlanta '96.\n\nShe said: \"I will look at it from a positive angle in the sense that the World Athletics Championship has its prize money from first to eighth position. The WA has taken it to the Olympics, starting with $50,000 for gold medallists. The body (WA) has stated clearly that Paris 2024 is like a test run, and that in subsequent Olympic Games, the prize money will trickle down to other categories of winners.\n\n\"To me, if an athlete wins clearly at the World Championships where there is prize money without the aid of drugs, he/she should be able to win clearly at the Olympic Games. My advice to all athletes is to stick to the rules of the game by competing cleanly without any form of cheating,\" Onyali stated.\n\nFormer Nigerian sprinter, jumper, and hurdler, Seigha Porbeni, shared Onyali's views when he said: \"The issue of price money, which WA has just introduced into the Paris Olympics has been a protracted debate.\n\n\"On the part of both athletes and coaches, it is a celebration considering the long hours of training, the amount spent on supplements, hiring of training gyms, payments of massage therapists, and so on. We do hope it will even be increased soon and also extend down to both silver and bronze medallists. This is a positive incentive. We are expecting more world records to go down in Paris and other Olympics.\"\n\nFor sports scientist, Adegoke Adelabu, the WA's decision is a wrong step since, according to him, \"the love of money is said to be the root of all evils.\"\n\nAdelabu, a former Nigeria international footballer told The Guardian. \"I cannot understand how World Athletics could reduce the dignity of participating in the Olympics and winning a gold medal to $50,000. No amount of money can compensate for the joy of participating in the Olympics. I don't think it is a motivational strategy for athletes to try and win gold medals to collect $50,000.\"\n\nThe former IICC Shooting Stars of Ibadan player continued: \"It is a serious error for the World Athletics to think that it can control the emotional responses of the athletes through cash. Intrinsically, it is not a good emotional stimulation strategy to increase the performance of the athletes, rather it has reduced the value of winning an Olympic gold medal to something that has a price tag instead of an inspirational tag.\n\n\"The implications are that the worth of an Olympic gold medalist is just $50,000 no matter what happens to the athlete during the game. It is no longer about the dignity of the game and participation, but the monetary value. What we will be counting now is how many $50,000 is won by each country.\"\n\nAlthough Adelabu believes that there is nothing wrong in compensating an athlete for a brilliant performance, he said it would have been like a surprise package during the Games.\n\n\"The question we need to ask our athletes is why they want to win gold medals; then they will say to collect $50,000. How ridiculous! If the same question was asked before, you would hear something like, 'I want to be the best in the world'.\n\n\"The dilemma before the athletes is the psychological trauma of trying to dissociate the thought of collecting $50,000 if he or she wins the gold medal and enduring the risks associated with training to perform at such a level because he wants to win the gold medal. It is just like asking a footballer to keep control of the ball on a slippery pitch,\" Adelabu stated.\n\nFormer world heavyweight wrestling champion, Osita Offor, also known as De Ultimate Commander: \"Restricting the rewards to only athletics might make things unsavory at the Games,\" he said, querying, \"What happens to the wrestler who battles all odds to win a gold medal?\n\n\"You can imagine what it would have done to our wrestlers' morale if they knew that a gold medal would fetch them $50,000.\n\n\"In Tokyo, we lost sure gold medals to last-minute mistakes. I am sure the likes of Adekuoroye, Oborodudu, and others would rather die on the mat than allow the gold and reward to elude them.\n\n\"To me, it is either they make it a uniform reward for all sports or jettison it.\"", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki",

Though, not everyone is enamoured with how the measures are being introduced.\n\nAccording to World Athletics: \"A total prize pot of US$2.4m (\u20ac2.2m) has been ring fenced from the International Olympic Committee's revenue share allocation, which is received by World Athletics every four years. This will be used to reward athletes who win a gold medal in each of the 48 athletics events in Paris with US$50,000.\"\n\nIndividual winners get the $50k, while relay teams will share it. The prize money will be extended to second and third placed athletes for the 2028 LA Olympic Games, though amounts haven't yet been decided.\n\nSo far, so fair one might think.\n\n\"The introduction of prize money for Olympic gold medalists is a pivotal moment for World Athletics and the sport of athletics as a whole, underscoring our commitment to empowering the athletes and recognising the critical role they play in the success of any Olympic Games,\" World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said, following the announcement.\n\n\"This is the continuation of a journey we started back in 2015, which sees all the money World Athletics receives from the International Olympic Committee for the Olympic Games go directly back into our sport,\" he added.\n\nPrize money, on the face of it, should be a positive move, and two tennis greats have praised the move.\n\n\"The Olympics have always been the biggest sports event and the athletes were the only ones not making money,\" Martina Navratilova said. Boris Becker, meanwhile, said that when he heard the news of prize money being introduced to athletics, he felt \"finally someone is coming with the times\".\n\nHowever, the introduction of prize money hasn't been met with quite as much positivity as I would imagine World Athletics hoped. It has been highlighted that it could create an 'us and them' feeling among different sports.\n\nFive-time Olympic gold medalist, Steve Redgrave, said this winners pot is \"giving money to people who already have it\" and he believes that all the gold medalists are capable of \"earning significant money before and certainly after\" the Olympics.\n\n\"I know the arguments that athletics is the flagship of the Olympics, and it is a step in the right direction for people who are bringing the audience in to the sport and the Games itself. But it becomes an us and them situation,\" he said.\n\nSure, athletes have the opportunity to earn money, but a significant chunk of that might be outside of their sport. I completely disagree that that should be expected to be a means of earnings.\n\nPrimarily when the athletes are athletes, they should be able to avail of prize money within their chosen sport, when that money is available to them.\n\nThough, I am inclined to agree that if prize money is being introduced it should be introduced across all sports and not just for gold-medalists in one area. With different governing bodies over each sport, that would be a difficult one to introduce.\n\nThe Olympics has always been a strange one given the mix of sports, the variation between professional and amateur sports, and the move towards almost fully professional now across the board. Overall the introduction of prize money, despite it being in just one sport, is definitely a move towards something positive.\n\nWhile most athletes that go to the Olympics these days are professional, there are many who aren't funded particularly well, and without sponsorship deals it can be a difficult path to take.\n\nPrize money for winning -- and soon placing at -- the biggest competition in the world can only be a good thing.\n\nThese athletes deserve recognition for their hard work, and they shouldn't have to rely on brand sponsorship deals outside of their sports for that.\n\nThe Olympic Games take place in Paris, and will kick off on July 26.", "source": {"uri": "echolive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Echo Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Navratilova", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martina Navratilova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Coe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Coe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Redgrave", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Redgrave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Becker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boris Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/8209/4104583_1_seoimageog_gold_20medal_1_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551884", "eventUri": "eng-9551884", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-26", "textStart": 4177, "textEnd": 4184}], "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

After the troublesome affair that made her pull out of the 2020 Olympic team finals, Biles is hoping for a better end to this year's Games in Paris in July. As the world speculates if it was the \"twisties\" that made Biles return for one more time for the quadrennial tournament, it seems like the authorities are also determined to give the 27-year-old a safe environment to display her skills to the world.\n\nThe four-time Olympic gold medalist returned to international competition after a two-year gap following the Tokyo incident. But the Olympic apex body (International Olympics Committee) is also making preparations to ensure the visiting athletes won't have to showcase their prowess at the cost of their mental health.\n\nSimone Biles' experience caught the right attention\n\nIn a recent article by The Guardian, the IOC's latest steps for the Olympics have been shed light upon. The mental health toolkit that was designed and implemented before the 2020 Summer Games is now waiting to be updated. The 2024 Paris Olympics will promote wellness, and a mindfulness program will also look to ensure the athletes' mental well-being. The IOC will also hand out 2,000 licenses to the visiting athletes for the newly developed Calm app, along with a mental fitness helpline, to keep track of their day-to-day mental conditions.\n\nA mental decompression zone will also help athletes find a recluse from the noise of the Olympic Village. Moreover, the IOC will also extend support to athletes in 70 different languages to help them keep their heads in the game. On top of that, artificial intelligence to identify and suppress abusive posts or comments against athletes will also be used by the Olympic authorities to create a barrier around the stars.\n\n\"They should feel that there are support systems around them,\" said Kirsty Burrows about the initiatives to create a healthy environment for the upcoming Olympics. With so many efforts by the organizers, it waits to be seen if Simone Biles can make the most of the opportunity at hand, and turn her silver and bronze medals from the 2020 Games into gold this time. But she certainly won't be the only athlete to benefit from these steps.\n\nMore athletes have gone through harrowing experiences\n\nPole vaulter Holly Bradshaw of Britain also slammed the conditions that athletes have to go through. The Olympic medalist's statement claiming that athletes are viewed as \"medal-winning machines\" sent a ripple across the sporting community. She acted on behalf of several other athletes who talked about their experiences in an academic paper, which Bradshaw found while trying to find out more about post-Olympic blues.\n\nOn the other hand, British gymnast Bryony Page also talked about \"lost skills syndrome,\" which affected her performance at the Rio Olympics. With nearly 15 million visitors who are expected to make the upcoming Olympics an already pressurizing affair for the athletes, the IOC's latest strategies will possibly help to minimize such experiences as Bradshaw's and Biles' to help athletes keep their eyes on the prize.", "source": {"uri": "essentiallysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EssentiallySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mindfulness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryony_Page", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryony Page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Bradshaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holly Bradshaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_vault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pole vault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/image-1920x1080-2024-04-17T103847.223-1.jpg?class=watermark", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551884", "eventUri": "eng-9551884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Track and Field's governing body will pay gold medalists $50,000 at the upcoming Paris Olympics and will add payments for silver and bronze medalists at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\nWhy has this provoked reactions in the sports world? Well, because it's the governing body of the sport that is making payments at an event that still at times pretends it is the purest of athletic contests. The Olympic Games were famously amateur for most of the 20th century, but amateur sports are for hobbyists nowadays. If you're an Olympian, you're basically a professional.\n\nIn the 21st century, Olympic athletes get paid - not usually to appear, but to perform. An Olympic gold medal is a pretty sure way of getting rich. Some countries offer hundreds of thousands of dollars for medals. Japan offers $45,000 for a gold medal.\n\nEven the Communist countries of old would compensate their athletes, who they regarded as an extension of the state and a tool of soft power. Usually, payment came in the form of a nice house or apartment, and maybe a car and an easy job upon retirement. A gold medal not only carried financial rewards for the athlete, but it had political and prestige power for the country. The Communists selected, trained and drugged their athletes from a young age to try and achieve superiority over the decadent West. And it worked, at least until the sports star had an opportunity to defect to the West to make some real money.\n\nThe question is: What will World Athletics get for its money? Will $50,000 make any athlete run faster, throw harder or jump higher? Well, possibly, but again, how will that benefit World Athletics? They will always have a gold medalist, whether or not they pay him/ her a cash reward.\n\nAthletes usually need money when they are developing, i.e., before they get to the Olympic standard. So World Athletics could be depriving poorer athletes of reaching their full potential. One theory of sports goes that the greatest competition is always found below; raise that level and all athletes improve. An example of this can be found in golf. Tiger Woods was head and shoulders above his contemporaries at his peak, but his success forced those contemporaries and those who came later to up their game, to reach new levels of skill and athleticism and the sport was transformed as a result. Money wasn't the motivating factor; Tiger just set a new benchmark for a professional golfer.\n\nThe argument could be made that competitors compete because they are competitors, because they are winners, or at least trying to be. Soccer fans become incensed when they think that a player in one of the top men's leagues in Europe is not pulling his weight. Many fans believe that players are vastly overpaid for kicking a ball around and lack of effort is guaranteed to make a fan's blood boil (not to mention that of teammates).\n\nSome of the richest professional athletes in the world now compete in the Olympics: soccer players, golfers, tennis players, runners, baseball players. In the old days, only amateurs would compete, because only the purity of the sport mattered (OK, unless you were a Nazi or a Communist). The sport still matters, but any athlete worth his place in the Games will have a whole bunch of money riding on their success in that sport. And, of course, the rich get richer, and the richer win more medals.\n\nAthletes in the past would have a day job and train early in the morning and at night. Money from sponsorships, broadcasting rights and cash awards from sports federations now give some athletes a huge advantage as they can dedicate themselves to their sport on a full-time basis. Perhaps World Athletics is trying to reward some athletes for their dedication, post facto.\n\n\"The introduction of prize money for Olympic gold medalists is a pivotal commitment to empowering the athletes and recognizing the critical role they play in the success of any Olympic Games,\" World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said in a statement.\n\nIn Coe's defense, his organization is at least recompensing their athletes for their efforts. Not all sports organizations are as generous. According to an AP report, 58 percent of athletes in a survey covering 48 countries said they did not consider themselves financially stable and 57 percent said the International Olympic Committee should pay athletes who appear at the Games.\n\nIOC boss Thomas Bach said World Athletics \"should focus its funding on supporting athletes at the other end of the spectrum.\" He might also have pointed out that the most famous runner of this century, Usain Bolt, was reportedly earning $30 million a year on the back of his Olympic success. He may not have laughed at Coe's $50,000, but he probably wouldn't have noticed it.\n\nBut for the athlete, training in poverty is no laughing matter.", "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Japan Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amateur sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Coe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Coe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Bach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/79/52/821b3ec23de324a7e4867d9c3e1344309e10/Gold-Medal-Cash_istockphoto-1024534886-2048x2048/_w1700.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551884", "eventUri": "eng-9551884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The brand hopes to capitalize on both the novelty of the sport, only a recent addition to the Olympic Games, and the profile of skateboarder Sky Brown.\n\nPowerade is working with dozens of athletes across 30 different markets, including Chilean para-swimmer Alberto Abarza, French cyclist Mathilde Gros and U.S. champion gymnast Simone Biles. The roster is by far the largest set of athletes the sports drink brand has involved in an Olympics campaign, according to Matrona Filippou, president global category of tea, coffee, sports and hydration at The Coca-Cola Company.\n\n\"This is the first time we've involved athletes like this,\" she said. The campaign includes a traditional TV spot starring Biles, it's also set to leverage those athletes' own social channels; Abarza and Gros each have established Instagram presences, while Biles also brings a sizable TikTok following. Influencer activity involving those athletes is set to increase in frequency as the games draw closer, said Filippou.\n\nJoe Weston, head of sport at influencer and social agency We Are Social, told Digiday that \"athletes benefit from an organic reach brand channels can't have,\" and that advertisers were likely to gain a larger reach by putting budget towards boosting posts made by their athlete partners than buying paid social inventory starring those same stars. By putting paid spend \"behind the athlete's channel and not your brand channel, you're putting petrol on the fire,\" he said.\n\nChoosing the right athletes, though, is key to realizing that idea. For some advertisers, selection is a pretty straightforward matter of matching key markets against crowd-favorite events and athletes that have already built a presence on social platforms.\n\nWe Are Social client Adidas is working with American track and field athlete Noah Lyles, a partnership that Weston said was in a \"sweet spot\" combining public awareness, creative potential and media placement.\n\n\"He is someone right at the elite of their sport, who has a very good chance of breaking a world record [and] he's also hugely charismatic and social native,\" said Weston.\n\nOther brands are using a different rationale. Filippou said that Powerade picked athletes who had experienced a comeback moment during their careers, to better fit its \"Pause is power\" positioning (the brand is also promoting a limited availability \"gold\" version of Powerade, which is mango-flavored). Chief among them is Biles, who took a widely publicized break from competition following the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"Having her as our hero ambassador is critical because she's so authentic, and she has such a great comeback story,\" said Filippou.\n\nReese's Pieces, by contrast, picked out two high profile Olympic and Paralympic athletes -- Alex Morgan and Jessica Long -- and pitted them against newcomers Sophia Smith and Haven Shepherd, to support a campaign promoting Reese's Medals, a limited-time product available only for the duration of the Olympics.\n\nMarketers at Old El Paso, meanwhile, hope to play up an association between families and teams. Its agency M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment is working with four U.K. Olympians (swimmer Tom Dean, cyclist Bethany Shriever, diver Jack Laugher and weightlifter Emily Campbell), featuring each in above-the-line work as well as producing content that shows their family lives and training regimes.\n\n\"Not everyone is an elite athlete, but everyone has a home team that they will share a meal with,\" said Charlie Carpenter, business director at M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment.\n\nRyan Reiss, vice-president of brand strategy and creative development at Reese's owner Hershey, told Digiday the brand is kicking off that promotional work with TV spots featuring actor Will Arnett, but will push its ambassadors to the front as the Olympic Games approach. \"As you get closer to the Olympics, you really want to be hearing about the athletes,\" he said. The quartet have already begun posting on their Instagram channels in support of the campaign, while Shepherd was drafted in for a special appearance at Hershey's World in Time Square, for an event that launched the Medals product.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) still maintains strict rules on advertising. Under Rule 40, last updated in 2023, athletes aren't allowed to issue brand endorsements or imply that a product enhanced their performance during the Olympic Games. Even \"thank you\" messages directed at brand partners are limited to one-per-advertiser. So, between the IOC's rules and time spent training for their events (the reason they're there, after all), marketers working with athletes will be need to tread carefully.\n\nWeston said: \"This is the pinnacle of their careers and for some of them it'll be the only Olympic Games they ever do. The idea of doing brand work close to that time is tough. You have to be really delicate with what your athletes are comfortable with and not comfortable with.\"\n\nThe four U.S. athletes working with Reese's, have been allowed to dictate the frequency and timing of their posts so that the campaign doesn't interfere with their training, a Hershey spokesperson confirmed by email. (Filippou, Weston and Smith declined to share precisely how many posts athletes would make on behalf of brand partners during their respective campaigns, or which platforms were being prioritized.)\n\nThat doesn't mean we won't see athletes blurring the line between Olympic participant and influencer. Weston noted that the Olympic Games and the luxury Olympic Village can act as a kind of training ground for sports personalities.\n\nMarketers should keep an eye on competing athletes' social platforms in July and August, he said, because they could become major sports personalities after this year's Games are done. Fresh names will likely emerge from the Olympic Games, while others can their core followings into crowds; Lyles has 99,000 TikTok followers now, but could end the summer with a much larger platform. \"For us, the Olympic Village becomes a content farm,\" he added.\n\nPowerade hopes to extend its campaign into the Village itself. In partnership with the IOC, it's built an annex to the grounds offering athletes a quiet space away from training or their other media duties.\n\nThe idea is to \"provide an environment for the athletes to come in and do some mental or physical recovery,\" said Filippou. If they decide to feature that environment on TikTok or Reels, that's just fine for The Coca-Cola Company.", "source": {"uri": "digiday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digiday"}, "authors":

Winding their way from east to west, the 10,500 athletes will cross through the center of the city. The parade will come to the end of its six-kilometer route in front of the Trocad\u00e9ro, where the remaining elements of Olympic protocol and final shows will take place.\n\nThe sporting action actually begins on Wednesday, July 24 with pool matches in football, rugby sevens, handball and archery.\n\nThere are 329 medal events across 32 sports. The first medal is set to be awarded in shooting on July 27 and the final medal event of Paris 2024 will be women's basketball on August 11.\n\nMost of the sporting events are in and around the heart of Paris.\n\nThe Stade de France will host the athletics and the closing ceremony.\n\nThe Parc des Princes, home to Paris St-Germain, will stage football matches, and Roland Garros will host tennis and boxing. Surfing will take place in Tahiti, an island in French Polynesia nearly 10,000 miles away from Paris.\n\nAbout 95 percent of the venues already exist or are temporary, with the aquatics center being the only new venue specifically built for the Games.\n\nAt the Olympic Summer Games in Paris in 2024, around 10,500 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and IOC Refugee Olympic Team will compete.\n\nWhen will the closing ceremony take place?\n\nThe closing ceremony will be held at the Stade de France, the country's national stadium, on Sunday, August 11.\n\nThe ceremony will include extravagant performances by celebrities from the host country, however, the details will not be revealed until the days before the big event.\n\nTraditionally, the Closing Ceremony begins with the Parade of Flags, in which athletes from each nation walk with their flag into the stadium.\n\nRead more:\n\nSaudi Arabia's Donia Abu Taleb set to make historic step for women at Paris

This shift underscores the pivotal role of sports psychologists in Latin America.\n\nThe landscape of sports in Latin America has undergone a seismic shift over the past decade, mainly due to the integration of advanced technology in physical training and performance metrics. However, as athletes across the region and the globe aim for higher, faster, and stronger feats, the need for robust mental preparation has come sharply into focus. In Panama, the role of sports psychologists is becoming increasingly vital, particularly as athletes prepare for the intense competition of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nSince 2021, Mar\u00eda Carla Sayavedra, the sports psychologist for the Olympic Committee of Panama (COP), has been instrumental in what she describes as \"mental muscle building\" for Panama's Olympic hopefuls. Her approach emphasizes the importance of physical readiness and the critical nature of mental strength, a sentiment echoed by the athletes themselves. \"They have shown me that taking care of their mental health is a priority and speaks volumes about them as human beings, not just athletes,\" Sayavedra told the EFE news agency.\n\nThe athletes preparing for Paris 2024, currently numbering four qualified individuals, are a testament to the growing awareness of the psychological demands of their sports. \"We are working on the mental aspect within each sports discipline. We are connected and very aware of the importance of being mentally strong. I can attest that they are physically and mentally caring for themselves,\" Sayavedra added.\n\nThis dual focus on mind and body is not just about coping with the pressures of international competition; it's about optimizing performance in every possible way. For these athletes, understanding their thoughts and emotions and maintaining a positive mindset has allowed them to achieve remarkable success in their fields.\n\nIn high-stakes environments like the Olympics, the role of a sports psychologist becomes even more pronounced. Sayavedra explains that preparing mentally for high-performance athletics is crucial and takes on additional significance as athletes approach significant competitions such as the Olympic Games. \"An elite athlete isn't made overnight. It's a process, like developing their mental and physical capabilities. That's why we need to prepare their mindset for what the Olympic Games or the Olympic cycle will demand,\" she emphasized.\n\nA significant part of Sayavedra's role involves helping athletes navigate the emotional landscapes of both victory and defeat. Dealing with loss consists of a process of mourning; it's a setback that needs to be acknowledged and managed sensitively. \"It's a loss, and it's important to validate their emotions first. I remind them that I am here when they're ready to talk, and if they don't want to talk, that's also valid,\" she pointed out.\n\nIn moments of triumph, it's crucial to recognize the feelings of the moment and the journey that led to the achievement. \"It's important to acknowledge everything they've done to get here, not just the victory itself,\" Sayavedra noted, underscoring the importance of celebrating the process as much as the outcome.\n\nIn preparation for competitions, Sayavedra works with athletes to set goals and follow up on their training, providing mental tools and working closely with their coaches. Techniques like mindfulness -- which involves meditation and focusing on the present -- and visualization help athletes stay grounded and focused. \"We often have to bring them back to reality, which is the only certainty they have at that moment,\" she explained.\n\nThe frequency of consultations in Sayavedra's office at the COP headquarters varies, depending on each athlete's needs and training progression. The tailored approach ensures that each athlete receives the support they need to excel on and off the field.\n\nThe significance of sports psychology extends beyond Panama. Across Latin America, where sports are often seen as pathways to educational and economic opportunities, the mental health of athletes is paramount. Countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia, with vital sports programs, are beginning to emphasize the psychological aspects of training, recognizing that mental resilience is as crucial as physical prowess.\n\nAs Latin American athletes continue to make their mark on the world stage, the integration of sports psychology into their training regimens will likely increase. This holistic approach enhances performance and ensures that athletes can manage the pressures of competition healthily and sustainably.\n\nTrial Commences for Panama Papers Money-Laundering Case\n\nIn conclusion, the evolving landscape of sports in Latin America reflects a broader shift toward recognizing and nurturing athletes' mental agility. As professionals like Mar\u00eda Carla Sayavedra continue to champion the cause of mental health in sports, the region's athletes are set to reap the benefits, embodying the true spirit of resilience and excellence in the global arena.", "source": {"uri": "latinamericanpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "latinamericanpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFE", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landscape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panama Papers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mindfulness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meditation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://latinamericanpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240509_Tecnologia-de-fortaleza-mental-dando-forma-a-los-atletas-olimpicos-de-Panama.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551884", "eventUri": "eng-9551884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

I am happy most of them have confirmed that they want to come.\n\n\"Makarawu has confirmed that he wants to attend Africa Senior Championships and Chiyangwa has confirmed.\n\n\"Makarawu, he is coming to polish up for his event and chase the Olympic relay.\n\n\"We still have two slots for the Olympics which are determined by ranking.\n\n\"The best-ranked teams they qualify. So, the Africa Championships are an opportunity to get that ranking,\" added Tagara.\n\nZimbabwe did not send a team to the World Relays held recently in Bahamas.\n\nThe Bahamas race was the main Olympic qualifying event for relays.\n\nParticipating countries competed in 4x100m and 4x400m for both men and women and the mixed 4x400m.\n\nSome of the African countries that had their teams qualifying during the competition include Botswana and South Africa.\n\nBotswana won the men's 4x400m relay while South Africa finished second.\n\nFollowing the qualification of 14 teams per event in Bahamas, the remaining two places in each discipline will be awarded based on top lists during the qualification period -- December 31, 2022, to June 30, 2024.\n\nTagara explained the rationale behind their decision to skip the Bahamas event\n\n\"Bahamas we didn't send a team because we did not have athletes with good times.\n\n\"These guys in USA started to run good times but before that they had commitments.\n\n\"But now that they are free, we can get some of them.\"\n\nNAAZ will be hoping for a better outcome after athletes who competed at the African Games in Accra, Ghana missed qualification.\n\nThe African Games were another Olympics qualification platform.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

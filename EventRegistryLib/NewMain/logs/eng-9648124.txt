She retorted: \"First you're so cringey because you're saying those words,\" before abruptly hanging up.\n\nElsewhere in the episode, Kim vented her frustrations about her children's indifference during a conversation with her mum, Kris Jenner. When Kris asked how Kim spent her birthday with the kids, Kim said: \"I was stuck doing everything that everyone else wanted to do.\n\n\"I was stuck watching YouTube unboxing videos on my birthday, I had a FIFA tournament, Colour Me Mine. You should see the ugly thing I made. Like, this is not what I wanted to be doing on my birthday. I need to sit my kids down and be like, 'This isn't Mother's Day. Like, this is my day'.\"\n\nShe described the day as \"torture\" before Kris confessed she \"would die\" if forced to participate in any of those activities. A producer quizzed Kim about her idea of an ideal birthday during a confessional.\n\nShe said: \"To lock my door, not get out of my bed and eat cookies and cream ice cream all day long. That's what would have been my dream. But no, no one cares about my dreams, not my four kids.\"\n\nNew episodes of The Kardashians S5 stream weekly on Disney+\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarovski", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swarovski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time Person of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kris Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mom (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Personalized", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Personalized", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Home_Office", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Home Office", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33008564.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_KIM-KIDS-MAIN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648124", "eventUri": "eng-9648124", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Kris said in her confessional:\n\n\"I think that we've all, as moms, been through some days where we don't want to be doing what we're doing, but we do it for our kids. So, come on, Kim. Suck it up, do a little Color Me Mine.\"\n\nLMFAO!\n\nBack in the scene with her mom, the beauty mogul said that she wanted to become more like her \"tough\" sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, noting:\n\n\"I'm gonna get my s**t together and I'm gonna be a f**king drill sergeant. Like, Khlo\u00e9 is so tough.\"\n\nKanye West's ex-wife continued in her confessional:\n\n\"I'd say I'm like half of a Khlo\u00e9 parent or and half of a Kourtney parent. Kourtney's like, 'It's all love, do what you want,' you know, but then I also get Khlo\u00e9 and I get that order but it's difficult for me to be a really strict parent.\"\n\nWhile Kris may not have agreed with Kim's complaints, she did give her some solid advice. The momager suggested:\n\n\"You're gonna have to create some boundaries for everybody else including me, including your friends, including some business associates. You just need to create a world for yourself where less people have access to you. And everyone else can f**k off.\"\n\nKris also told cameras:\n\n\"Being a mom, being a working mom, it's really hard. I know Kim, and I know how she thrives on her workload, but we all still need a little bit of balance.\"\n\nFair! But being THIS upset about spending time with her children on her b-day is kinda wild. Especially when she's a grown-ass woman with ample financial assets who VERY easily could've made other plans for herself and not gone along with her kids' ideas! Calling time with them torture is crazy!! Right?? Reactions?!

But it's not us offering up that opinion -- it's coming from your own children!\n\nIn Thursday's brand new episode of The Kardashians that dropped on Hulu, the SKIMS founder found out just how awkward and embarrassing her kids view their famed momma. And the answer wasn't something that she wanted to hear! Heck, maybe now it makes perfect sense why she shaded the hell outta her kids regarding her less than ideal birthday... Ha!!\n\nRelated: Are These Kim K's New Besties?? Birthday Party Seating Would Seem To Imply...\n\nDuring the ep, the 43-year-old was filmed preparing to shoot the cover of GQ's \"Man Of The Year\" issue when she dropped this amazing quip in a confessional:\n\n\"Well, I'm so glad that I have a little bit of clout here being GQ's Man of The Year, because at home, like, I've turned into the embarrassing mom. The cringy mom.\"\n\nOh nooo!\n\nSay it ain't so, kids! Of course, Kim shares North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm West, 4 with her ex-husband Kanye West. And do those kids REALLY think she's cringy? Uh, YES! They do! Cutting from the confessional to a scene with the fam, the episode shows Kim straight-up asking Saint about it:\n\n\"Do you think I'm a cool mom or am I a cringy mom?\"\n\nImmediately, Saint replies with just one word:\n\n\"Cringe.\"\n\nOuch...\n\nKim was skeptical about Saint's slam, tho! She accused him of stealing the word from North! She replied:\n\n\"Oh, I'm a cringe mom?! Are you the new North? North says I'm so cringe.\"\n\nAhh, so it's not Saint who first determined that. It was devious little Nori! LOLz! To combat her cringe status, Kim admitted in another confessional that she has been trying to pick up new slang words on TikTok. Sadly for her, tho, that never goes over well. She revealed:\n\n\"My kids, they say 'gyat,' and 'gyat' means a big butt. I got it off TikTok and it was, like, made you feel so old, when you don't know what the slang words are. So I was like 'guys, we're late. We've gyat to go.' And they were like, 'MOM! You're so embarrassing.'\"\n\nLOLz!!\n\nAfter her exchange with Saint left her feeling blue, Kim decided to call North and get the real story. With her eldest child on the phone, the SKKN By Kim mogul asked:\n\n\"Why am I so cringy? Why am I so annoying?\"\n\nNorth wasted no time in responding coldly:\n\n\"First, you're so cringy because you're saying those words.\"\n\nThe deadpan response made Kim laugh, and she followed it up with a punny attempt at a joke:\n\n\"Gyat damn!\"\n\nAnd then North hung up!! Fed up that her mom was still using TikTok slang in an incorrect way, Nori abruptly ended the call. The convo closer left Kim reeling:\n\n\"Oh! She hung up on me!\"\n\nToo funny! Age comes for us all, Kim. What was cool in our day is decidedly uncool with the next generation coming up! It's a tale as old as time... LOLz! Thoughts, y'all??

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nKim Kardashian has been reflecting on her recent birthday and how it was less than ideal.\n\nOn the most recent episode of her family's reality show The Kardashians, she explained that she turned 43 while spending the day with her four children, who she shares with her ex-husband, Kanye West: daughters North West, 10, and Chicago West, six, and sons Saint West, eight, and Psalm West, four.\n\n\"I thought my birthday, I'd have a day to myself. I was stuck doing everything that everyone else wanted to do,\" she was telling her mother, Kris Jenner. \"I was stuck watching YouTube unboxing videos on my birthday. I had a FIFA tournament. Color Me Mine -- you should see the ugly thing I made. This is not what I wanted to be doing on my birthday.\"\n\n\"I need to sit my kids down and be like this isn't Mother's Day. Like this is my day. Do you think a mom wants to go to Color Me Mine one more time on her birthday? Whose birthday is it? I know I was tortured. Just make me breakfast. That's a great birthday.\"\n\nWhen asked what she would have preferred to do to celebrate her birthday, the Skims founder said it mostly involved her just being alone.\n\n\"To lock my door,\" she explained in a confessional. \"Not get out of my bed and eat cookies and cream ice cream all day long. That's what would have been my dream and no one cares about my dreams, not my four kids at least.\"\n\nKris later said during her own confessional that her daughter was complaining about a basic aspect of motherhood. \"I think that we've all, as moms, been through some days where we don't want to be doing what we're doing, but we do it for our kids. So, come on, Kim. Suck it up, do a little Color Me Mine,\" she said.\n\nKim continued talking to her mother, expressing her desire to be a stricter parent. \"I'm gonna get my s**t together and I'm gonna be a f***ing drill sergeant. Like, Khloe is so tough,\" she said about her sister, Khloe Kardashian.\n\nAs far as her own parenting style, Kim viewed it as a mix of Khloe and Kourtney's. \"Kourtney's like: 'It's all love, do what you want,' you know, but then I also get Khloe and I get that order but it's difficult for me to be a really strict parent,\" she explained.\n\nHer mother thought a good start to fixing the problem would be to create more distance between herself and her responsibilities to have more time to herself. \"You're gonna have to create some boundaries for everybody else including me, including your friends, including some business associates,\" she told Kim.\n\n\"You just need to create a world for yourself where less people have access to you. And everyone else can f*** off.\"\n\n\"Being a mom, being a working mom, it's really hard,\" Kris added in a confessional. \"I know Kim, and I know how she thrives on her workload, but we all still need a little bit of balance.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Kim was candid about her struggles being a working mother. In a previous episode of the reality show, she was trying to do a virtual interview as her children were banging on the door, leading her to locking herself in the bathroom as she described the moment as her \"biggest nightmare.\"\n\n\"I am a single mom of four, and it is wild,\" she said. \"I almost feel like my kids have this radar where they know that I'm doing something really important.

In new scenes from her Disney+ show The Kardashians, the 43-year-old Skims founder admitted she \"couldn't believe\" the way her kids were behaving.\n\nSitting in a car while on the way to jury duty, Kim was seen chatting on the phone to an unnamed friend when she began to vent about her children, confessing she was a \"push over\" when it came to her kids.\n\n\"Hey can I vent for one sec? It's been an extra troubling week where I was just like I can't do it anymore,\" Kim began, adding: \"I just... anything in that home is just chaotic right now. Oh my God, no, what I wanted to say was I had a Zoom at the house with all my kids there, banging on the door, just screaming, and I was literally hiding in a bathroom with the door locked as I was just like, I can't believe this. I mean I can believe it, but that's like my biggest nightmare.\"\n\nElaborating on her parenting techniques in a confessional, Kim told cameras: \"Sometimes it gets, just like a little intense. I want to be more strict like Khloe but I don't know why I have a hard time just saying no is no. I think I also just don't want to deal with the whining and the tears of not getting their way.\"\n\n\"They know when to con me and when to throw the little, you know, start with the tears so I'm like, 'Stop, stop, sure, take an iPad,' you know, just stop.

The reality star-turned-lawyer purchased Janet's outfit from the iconic 1993 music video for her single, If, three years ago at an auction. Kim spent a whopping $25,000 (\u00a319,571) on the costume back in 2021, explaining she was \"such a fan\".

She has been navigating life as a single mum since their split in February 2021 after six years of marriage.\n\nCameras were rolling for Hulu's The Kardashians and the reality star had no qualms moaning she didn't have the perfect birthday she dreamed of. In a cosy conversation with her mum Kris Jenner, she whinged she spent the day running around after her four children.\n\nWhat, how and why?\n\nShe said: \"I was stuck watching Youtube unboxing videos on my birthday. I had a FIFA tournament. Color Me Mine. You should see the ugly thing I made. Like this is not what I wanted to be doing on my birthday. I need to sit my kids down and be like, 'This isn't Mother's Day. Like this is my day. Do you think a mom wants to go to Color Me Mine one more time? On her birthday?'\"\n\nHer complaints were interrupted by her own mum's laughter. She added: \"Whose birthday is it? You know it was torture. Just make me breakfast. That's a great birthday.\"\n\nStirring the pot, TV bosses asked Kardashian how she would have liked to spend the day had it been her choice. \"What would your perfect birthday have been?\"\n\nThe TV personality answered truthfully saying that she would like to lock herself in her bedroom. She admitted: \"To lock my door, not get out of my bed, and eat cookies and cream ice cream all day long. That's what would have been my dream. But no. No one cares about my dreams. Not four kids at least.\"\n\nKardashian's motherhood struggles\n\nIt's been all drama this series of The Kardashians though, as expected, and it's not just about motherhood. British star Victoria Beckham made her debut on The Kardashians at Paris Fashion Week, where Kim Kardashian was apparently given the cold shoulder from Vogue's Anna Wintour.\n\nBeing a mother is something that Kardashian feels passionate about and she happily shares while cameras are rolling for the reality series, that streams internationally on Disney+. So unsurprisingly, this moment is not the first time that the Kardashian sister has voiced her struggles with motherhood though. On a phone call, the mum confessed she hides herself in the bathroom with the door locked when things get \"chaotic\" at home.\n\nShe said on the show: \"Anything in that home is just chaotic right now. Oh my God, no, what I wanted to say was I had a Zoom at the house with all my kids there, banging on the door, just screaming, and I was literally hiding in a bathroom with the door locked as I was just like, I can't believe this. I mean I can believe it, but that's like my biggest nightmare.\"\n\nOutside of the show, Kardashian has been wearing her heart on her sleeve when it comes to her personal parenting struggles. Last year she appeared on Jay Shetty's On Purpose and she said: \"Parenting is the thing that has taught me the most about myself.\"\n\nShe added: \"It has been the most challenging thing. There are nights I cry myself to sleep. Like, what happened with all the moods and the personalities? And sometimes they're fighting and there's no one there, it's me to play good cop and bad cop. So, that is definitely a challenge.

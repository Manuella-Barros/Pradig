Mandatory Credit: Katie Stratman-USA TODAY Sports / Katie Stratman-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds decided Wednesday was a good day to get Spencer Steer some time off. He is due for a good night at the plate.\n\nThe Reds are batting him fifth in the lineup on Thursday after having slotted him in the third spot 35 times this year. Steer is struggling mightily at the plate since the All-Star Break with just nine hits in 64 at-bats.\n\nSteer was looked at as a steadying force in the middle of the lineup for the Reds as the season began. He has been anything but steady this year, though.\n\nIn the first month of the year he hit .252 with an OPS of .797. Then his batting average dropped 80 points while his OPS plummeted 170 points in May. Then he rebounded with a .280 average in June and a .783 OPS but he has a grand total of 21 hits in 29 games since the beginning of July and just 15 total RBI.\n\nHe is the epitome of peaks and valleys at the plate and that is not who we believed Steer to be. That's not what scouts said about him as he was coming up. Look for him to turn it around for the final two months of the season and make his season numbers look a little more consistent.\n\nThe Reds need someone to step up in the middle of their lineup. If it's going to be Steer, he needs to get going tonight. The good news is, Steer has hit 12 homers off right-handed pitchers this year compared to just three off lefties.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Cincinnati Reds Talk for the latest news, exclusive

From a solid start to three Reds earning multiple hits, the game looked to be a close affair for nine innings. Then it all broke loose in the 10th.\n\n1. Hunter Green: Human After All\n\nAs it turns out, Hunter Greene is not an alien playing baseball for the Reds. Well, the jury is still out. Either way, his outing on Thursday was his worst since June 25. However, that's not saying much.\n\nOn 108 pitches, the 15th time he's thrown at least 100 this year, Green lasted six innings and was knocked around for six hits and three runs. He walked two and hit two others while tossing five strikeouts. Greene surrendered the most hits since the start of June 25.\n\nDue to that, his season ERA grew to 2.90. Still, not too bad.\n\nGreene was not his usual dominant self, both by his standards and thanks in part to an oddly inconsistent zone. Even then, six innings of three-run baseball is enough to get the win. He earned a no-decision on Thursday but either way, he's still one of the top pitchers in the game.\n\n2. Extra Innings Chaos!!!\n\nThe game started off hot. First, Tyler Stephenson grounded out but allowed Elly De La Cruz to score. Then, the next batter, TJ Friedl, smashed one 379 feet to right center. In the third, Friedl added another with an RBI single.\n\nThen, Greene had a rough fourth, allowing the Marlins to tie it up and the game stayed knotted at three until the 10th.\n\nThen, the Reds woke up.\n\nThe Reds first eight batters in the top of the 10th reached base. In the inning, the Reds totaled four hits, two walks, a hit by pitch, and seven runs.\n\nWith the ghost runner on second rules, the game is always on. The Reds were lucky that their second-fastest player was the starting ghost runner but it didn't matter. It was like that old Bugs Bunny baseball gif.\n\nThis is the Reds' third extra-innings win and is easily the largest margin of victory from a 10-inning game.\n\nDe La Cruz accounted for three hits (11 hits in the series) while Friedl and Spencer Steer each added two. The Reds only walked four times on the night but they all came from the top three hitters in the lineup (India walked twice).\n\n3. Onto Milwaukee\n\nWhile the NL Central is pretty much out of reach for the Reds (barring a miracle which would be welcomed, of course), the Wild Card is not. However, the next foe to be conquered is the NL Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nDespite being counted out this offseason, the Brewers are easily the top team in the division. Milwaukee is sitting at 65-49 after sweeping the Atlanta Braves. They outscored the Braves 34-12.\n\nThus far, the Reds have not fared well against the Brewers. In both series, the Brewers took two of three. They have seven more against Milwaukee on the schedule, starting with the next three at American Family Field.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "drew_crabtree@postandcourier.com", "name": "Drew Crabtree", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Greene_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Greene (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Hunter_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Hunter (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TJ_Friedl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TJ Friedl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Family_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Family Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugs_Bunny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bugs Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803176", "eventUri": "eng-9803176", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 389, "textEnd": 396, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

They also capitalized on a Marlins error when left fielder David Helsley and centerfielder Derek Hill collided on Noelvi Marte's bases-loaded fly ball.\n\nThe Reds won the season series 5 games to 2 against the Marlins, whose roster is almost unrecognizable since the front office's fire sale at the trade deadline.\n\nReds starter Hunter Greene was staked to a 3-0 lead Thursday as he took a 24-inning scoreless streak into the fourth inning, but a single, walk and hit batter loaded the bases with nobody out. And by the time he got out of the inning, the streak and the lead were both gone, thanks to a run-scoring grounder and pair of RBI singles.\n\nElly De La Cruz, who had back-to-back four-hit games to open the series, had two more hits and a walk Thursday, his first-inning single leading to the first run of the game after a wild pitch and throwing error by the catcher sent him to third. He scored on a grounder to short despite the infield being drawn in.\n\nTJ Friedl followed with a solo homer for a quick 2-0 lead.\n\nFriedl added a two-out, run-scoring single in the third to make it 3-0.\n\nBefore this one was over, manager David Bell was ejected after voicing his displeasure with home-plate umpire Bill Miller's strike zone, prompting his 31st career managerial ejection (in his 823rd game) - a record for baseball's oldest professional franchise.\n\nBell, in his sixth season, tied legendary Reds manager Sparky Anderson (nine seasons, 1,450 games as Reds manager) with No. 30 on June 23 against the Boston Red Sox.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Greene_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Greene (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TJ_Friedl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TJ Friedl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparky_Anderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sparky Anderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/08/PCIN/74729479007-getty-images-2165937572.jpg?auto=webp&crop=7609,4280,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803176", "eventUri": "eng-9803176", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 2131, "textEnd": 2138}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Miami won the third game of the series last night 6-4 behind powerful offense, including a first inning grand slam by the recently acquired Derek Hill.\n\nThe Reds won the first two games of the series. Their offense has looked better as of late. Despite the loss last night, Cincinnati has had three games in a row in which they have produced double-digit total hits. They still have lots of catching up to do in the National League wild-card race, as they are currently five and a half games from the third spot.\n\nAs for pitching matchups, the Reds will send right-hand pitcher Hunter Greene (8-4, 2.83 ERA) to the mound. He will be making his 23rd start of the season, and he has been solid for Cincinnati all season long. He has 149 strikeouts in 130 \u2153 innings pitched, and he only allowed one hit in his six innings of work in his most recent outing against the San Francisco Giants. If he has another good outing, it will be his sixth straight quality start.\n\nGreene will pitch against Marlins right-hander Kyle Tyler (0-2, 5.27 ERA). This will be his seventh start of the season. It wasn't a good outing for him the last time he pitched, which was on Saturday, Aug. 3 when he went two and two-thirds innings allowing three runs on five hits against the Atlanta Braves. The 27-year-old has pitched through or past the fifth inning once this season, meaning his only quality start in 2024 was that one time.\n\nHere are the lineups for both teams\n\nCincinnati Reds\n\n1.) 2B Jonathan India\n\n2.) SS Elly De La Cruz\n\n3.) C Tyler Stephenson\n\n4.) CF TJ Friedl\n\n5.) 1B Spencer Steer\n\n6.) DH Jeimer Candelario\n\n7.) RF Jake Fraley\n\n8.) 3B Noelvi Marte\n\n9.) LF Will Benson\n\nSP Hunter Greene\n\nMiami Marlins\n\n1.) SS Xavier Edwards\n\n2.) 3B Jake Burger\n\n3.) DH Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez\n\n4.) 1B Jonah Bride\n\n5.) 2B Otto Lopez\n\n6.) LF Kyle Stowers\n\n7.) CF Derek Hill\n\n8.) RF Vidal Bruj\u00e1n\n\n9.) C Jhonny Pereda\n\nSP Kyle Tyler\n\nHow to watch\n\nThe first pitch is scheduled for 6:10 p.m. ET.

Five of the runs were earned as the Reds claimed the series three games to one.\n\nReds shortstop Elly De La Cruz had a great series, going 11-for-19 with four doubles, two homers, six runs, five RBIs, two steals and two walks. De La Cruz went 3-for-5 on Thursday.\n\nTJ Friedl went 2-for-4 with a homer and three RBIs.

In the second inning, he made a full-extension diving catching on a shot by Noelvi Marte. Then, in the fifth, Brujan made a leaping catch before crashing into the wall on a drive by Jonathan India.\n\nNeither starting pitcher earned a decision.\n\nCincinnati's Hunter Greene extended his scoreless innings streak to 24 until Miami put up three runs in the third.

The Marlins loaded the bases with no outs as Jonah Bride singled, Otto Lopez walked, and Kyle Stowers was hit by a pitch. The Marlins then cashed in with Derek Hill's RBI groundout and run-scoring singles from Brujan and Pereda.\n\nCincinnati loaded the bases with no outs in the 10th before Stephenson drew his walk on a pitch that appeared to hit the bottom of the strike zone.

This game went into extra innings, and the Marlins bullpen didn't get the job done in preventing the Reds from scoring.\n\nMiami's offense got nine hits on Thursday night, which helped them score three runs before extra innings despite Reds starting pitcher Hunter Greene going six innings with five strikeouts. They were down 3-0 until the fourth inning. After an RBI groundout by Derek Hill, they got RBI singles from Vidal Bruj\u00e1n and Jhonny Pereda to tie the game.\n\nThen came the 10th inning, in which Marlins relief pitcher Emmanuel Ramirez allowed seven runs on three hits and two walks. Two of the seven runs were unearned, and that was due to an error by the Marlins outfield in which they missed a pop-up.\n\nThis was a horrific inning for Ramirez, who has pitched well for the Marlins in seven relief appearances this season. He was recalled from Triple-A Jacksonville a couple of weeks ago to take the roster spot of recently traded A.J. Puk.\n\nKyle Tyler's Marlins outing on Thursday didn't quite go well. The 27-year-old right-hander went four and a third inning, allowing three runs on five hits and struck out three batters. The first two runs came from the top of the first inning, including TJ Friedl's seventh home run of the season.\n\nThis loss puts Miami at 43-73. The Reds, meanwhile, are 56-59 and still in the thick of things in a tight National League wild-card race.\n\nThe Marlins will take the field again on Friday, Aug. 9 against another team in the wild-card race, the San Diego Padres.

On the other side, Miami had to go against Hunter Greene, one of the league's best pitchers this season. Through three innings, the odds the Marlins would win the game appeared slim to none.\n\nBut in the bottom of the fourth inning, the team had an unexpected offensive outburst. After the first three batters of the inning got on base, center fielder Derek Hill, right fielder Vidal Brujan and catcher Jhonny Pereda drove in runs to tie up the game.\n\nIt was Pereda's second career major league hit, with his first coming an inning earlier.\n\n\"It was definitely a dream that I had since I was a little kid, and obviously [with] the long journey that I had through the minor league system, it just felt good to be able to get that first hit,\" Pereda said.\n\nWhile the career milestone was something that Pereda coveted, the ball was nearly lost for good.\n\n\"I saw that Elly [De La Cruz] threw the ball and it went into the stands,\" Pereda said. \"The first thought that came to my head was whether I'm able to get it back. Thankfully it came back to me.\"\n\nAfter tying up the score, the Marlins just needed one more run to clinch the game and even the series before leaving the clubhouse. But despite several opportunities, the team went just 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\"We had a chance in the eighth and ninth inning and just could not get that big hit,\" Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said. \"We had guys on base in scoring position. Felt like with the top of the order or the bottom of the order, with either one, we had our shot. [We] just couldn't get that big hit.\"\n\nThe game remained tied after nine innings. But that's when the tires started to fall off.\n\nAfter relief pitcher Emmanuel Ramirez walked Jonathan India and allowed an Elly De La Cruz single, Reds catcher Tyler Stephenson was up to bat. After Stephenson battled to make it a full count, a controversial ball toward the bottom of the zone gave Cincinnati the first run of extra innings. From there, the Reds broke open the game, scoring six more runs to make it a 10-3 ball game.\n\nThe deficit was too much to overcome for the Marlins in one inning.\n\nDespite a commendable performance by a number of players, the game demonstrated how dire the situation was for the Marlins' starting pitching. Tyler went just 4.1 innings, which put pressure on the Miami bullpen to carry the team the rest of the way.\n\nThe Marlins substituted seven different bullpen pitchers into the game. Through nine innings, the team had already used their go-to arms like Jesus Tinoco, Declan Cronin, Andrew Nardi, Anthony Bender and Calvin Faucher. By the time it went to extras, they had to go to Ramirez, who has only pitched in 16.1 innings this year.\n\n\"We're just crushing the bullpen,\" Schumaker said. \"[Tyler] has seven starts but I think he went five innings just one time. So we gotta get over that and get into the fifth and sixth inning, so we can give a couple guys out there a break.\"\n\nWith numerous starters still on the injury list, the Marlins have relied on bullpen pitching to get them through games this year. On Wednesday, the team received a 5.2 inning shutout from rookie Valente Bellozo. But for all the starting pitchers like Tyler, Bellozo, Edward Cabrera and Roddery Munoz, the remaining starts they get this season will likely determine whether they will even be on the team in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Tyler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Tyler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Hill_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derek Hill (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Greene_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Greene (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Schumaker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skip Schumaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nardi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Bender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cabrera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Cabrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/miami_herald_mcclatchy_975/3b04551dea137481372f89f3ba9748b2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803176", "eventUri": "eng-9803176", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

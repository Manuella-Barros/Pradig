You can check out at any time. More info\n\nWales have called rugby league superstar Regan Grace into their summer squad.\n\nThe 27-year-old replaces Ospreys wing Keelan Giles, who has a groin injury with Grace added to the 39-man training squad which will be cut down to 34 ahead of the Australia tour. Wales have also announced Scarlets tighthead Henry Thomas has been ruled out of the South Africa game with Keiran Assiratti replacing the former England prop in the starting line-up and Harri O'Connor coming onto the bench.\n\nGrace, who recently signed a contract with Bath, would not have been eligible for selection this weekend due to the game falling outside of the designated international window. But the fact he has been added to the Wales squad suggests he is being seriously considered as an option for Wales' two-Test tour of Australia which also included an uncapped game against the Queensland Reds.\n\nSIGN UP: Get the new exclusive Inside Welsh rugby newsletter for full insight into what's really going on around all the big issues. This special offer will get you full access for the entire year for just \u00a310 instead of \u00a340.\n\nThe other wingers in the training squad are Josh Hathaway, Rio Dyer and Liam Williams, while Mason Grady can also play on the wing. Grace is one of the most prolific try scorers in rugby league history, playing 143 times and scoring 89 tries for St Helens, helping them win three Super League Grand finals along with a Challenge Cup.\n\nHe ruptured his Achilles tendon in August 2022 before joining French Top 14 club Racing 92, but he did not feature for them after suffering an injury relapse six months later. Grace was then picked up by Bath where he completed a successful trial period and was awarded a permanent contract.\n\nAs of yet the man from Port Talbot, who also qualifies for England, has not played a competitive game of professional rugby union with his only appearances for Bath coming in friendlies against Leinster and Gloucester, respectively.\n\nIf he were to play for Wales this summer his first competitive match of rugby union could be a Test match. Grace's finishing ability is not in doubt, with his blistering pace and deceptive footwork capable of opening up the best defences.\n\nBut he has not played a competitive game of rugby union or league for two years and there will be question marks surrounding his defence and aerial ability given his height.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"},

Grace was a rugby league superstar for St Helens before switching codes in 2022, but his move to French glamour club Racing 92 went off the rails when he suffered an Achilles injury shortly before moving to Paris and he never played a game for club.\n\nREAD MORE: Bath Rugby lock Charlie Ewels returns for England as Steve Borthwick selects his side to face Japan\n\nAfter linking up with the club while continuing his rehab, the 27-year-old made his professional rugby union debut for Bath in a friendly against Gloucester back in March and then came off the bench against Leinster a week later after signing a short-term deal with the Blue, Black and White. Having returned to full fitness, the Welshman then signed a contract with Bath until the end of the 2024/25 season with an option for 2025/26. However, he failed to make another appearance in the Blue, Black and White before the end of the season which culminated in Bath reaching the Gallagher Premiership final, falling just short 25-21, against Northampton Saints.\n\nGatland has named a highly inexperienced squad for the summer internationals, including young Gloucester winger Josh Hathaway and Bath tighthead prop Archie Griffen. Wales face the Springboks at Twickenham this Saturday and will then fly out to Australia for a two Test series against the Wallabies and an uncapped match against the Queensland Reds, but before that 39-man training squad will be cut down to 34.\n\nSpeaking about Grace when he signed him, Bath head of rugby Johann van Graan, said: \"Regan has impressed both on and off the pitch over the last few months. He has a clear point of difference in his play and that will be very valuable for our team. It's great to have Regan on board.\"\n\nRegan played 143 times and scored 89 tries for rugby league side St Helens across six seasons, during which time he won three Super League Grand Final rings and a Challenge Cup winners' medal, before making the switch to rugby union.", "source": {"uri": "somersetlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Somerset Live"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Gatland's team face the most daunting of tasks against back-to-back world champions South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday before flying to Australia for two Tests with the Wallabies.\n\nAhead of a series of pivotal matches, head coach Gatland has a number of fitness problems to deal with. Former St Helens man Grace trained with Wales on Thursday but separate to the main group after being called up to replace Keelan Giles as a wing option. Giles suffered a groin injury in training. Grace swapped codes in 2022 and is currently contracted to Bath.\n\nBut despite the fact he has played only two friendlies for the Premiership side, he is now likely to travel to Australia. Wales on Thursday confirmed the withdrawal of prop Henry Thomas from their XV to face South Africa with a foot problem, but Mail Sport understands there are further woes for Gatland to deal with as hooker Elliot Dee won't travel to Australia due to injury.\n\nRookie Cardiff hooker Efan Daniel trained with Wales on Thursday as a result and is set to go to the southern hemisphere as a No 2 option alongside Dewi Lake and Evan Lloyd.\n\nAnother hooker in Sam Parry, who was named in the original Wales summer squad, won't travel despite seemingly being ahead of Daniel in the initial pecking order.\n\nRegan Grace is likely to go Down Under after his shock call-up - despite never playing a competitive game in union!\n\nWarren Gatland has called on the former rugby league star amid a deepening injury crisis\n\nAsked on Thursday if Wales had any other injury concerns other than Thomas and Giles' withdrawal, forwards coach Jonathan Humphreys said: 'No, we're OK.'\n\nBut that is not the case. Not only is Dee is out of the Australia tour, but neither prop Dillon Lewis nor lock Cory Hill are at 100 per cent. Hill is recovering from a calf issue and while he was part of Wales' training session on Thursday, worries over Thomas and Lewis have led Gatland to call-up another tighthead prop option in Ben Warren of the Ospreys.\n\nWales still hope Thomas will be able to make the Australia trip. Warren is set to be a travelling reserve with Wales for their South Africa game.\n\n'He suffered an innocuous injury from scrummaging on Tuesday,' Humphreys said of former England man Thomas. 'He went to see a specialist last night. It looks pretty positive.'\n\nHumphreys said of Grace: 'He's got speed. We've lost a few in the back three and he's got X Factor.\n\n'It's great to get him in the environment and get to know him a bit better. You can't buy what he's got. We're excited to have him here. He's got gas and he can make things happen.'\n\nGrace was a prolific try scorer in rugby league, crossing the line 89 times in 143 games for St Helens and winning three Super League titles and a Challenge Cup.\n\nBut his time in the 15-man game has been decimated by serious Achilles injuries. Grace first started in union with Racing 92 but never played for the French side before joining Bath.\n\nGrace has been called up to replace winger Keelan Giles, who suffered a groin injury in training\n\nHis only games for Johann van Graan's side came in pre-season friendlies with Gloucester and Leinster last year.\n\nWales are without their players employed by English clubs for the South Africa game as the match falls outside World Rugby's designated Test window meaning they are unavailable.\n\nWhile the likes of Dafydd Jenkins, Tommy Reffell and Nick Tompkins will boost Gatland's squad strength for the Australia matches, the Wales head coach could certainly do with some better luck.\n\nWales will be more than up against it when they face a fearsome South African side.\n\nThe match comes on the back of Gatland's men finishing bottom of the Six Nations without a win.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nRegan Grace has been backed to bring some X factor to Wales' backline.\n\nThe 27-year-old was a shock call-up to Wales' training squad after an injury to Ospreys wing Keelan Giles and is being considered for the tour of Australia, with Warren Gatland cutting his squad from 39 to 34 after Saturday's clash with South Africa. While there is no guarantee Grace will figure this summer, Jonathan Humphreys believes he could be a big asset for Wales moving forward.\n\n\"He's got speed,\" said the Wales forwards coach. \"We've lost a few in the back three and he's got that X factor.\n\nSIGN UP: Get the new exclusive Inside Welsh rugby newsletter for full insight into what's really going on around all the big issues. This special offer will get you full access for the entire year for just \u00a310 instead of \u00a340.\n\n\"It's great to get him in the environment, get to know him a bit better and find out what he's about. You can't buy what he's got.\n\n\"It's really exciting, he's a great kid and he's excited to be here.\"\n\nGrace was a superstar in rugby league, scoring 89 tries for St Helens during a league career that saw him feature in three Super League Grand Final-winning teams, while he also has a Challenge Cup winning medal.\n\nBut after switching codes and signing for French giants Racing 92, Grace ruptured his Achilles which meant he didn't play a single game for the Parisians. He has landed a permanent contract with Bath after a trial period but has never played a competitive game of professional rugby union, with his only appearances for the Premiership finalists coming in friendlies against Gloucester and Leinster, respectively.\n\n\"He's a rugby player,\" said Humphreys. \"We've got enough experience in the coaching set-up in that area to give him whatever he needs.\n\n\"We are just really excited to have him in here because he's got that X factor. He has got gas and can make things happen.\"\n\nHenry Thomas was was forced to pull out of Wales' starting XV with a foot injury but Humphreys doesn't think it will rule him out of the tour of Australia. \"It's an innocuous injury he had when we were scrummaging on Tuesday so that's something he's never had before,\" said Humphreys.\n\n\"He went to see the specialist last night and it looks pretty positive. We are going to treat that aggressively and at the end of this game we are going to assess where he is after a few more days in the physio and hopefully he's still an option to go to Australia.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steffan_thomas@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Steffan Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelan_Giles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keelan Giles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ospreys_(rugby_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ospreys (rugby union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Humphreys", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Humphreys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regan_Grace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regan Grace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Gatland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Gatland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_92", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racing 92"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Challenge Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helens_R.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Helens R.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby league"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_Rugby", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premiership Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Humphreys_(rugby_union)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Humphreys (rugby union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_Rugby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bath Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leinster_Rugby", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leinster Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(rugby)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scrum (rugby)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gloucester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gloucester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29392178.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_grace1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667779", "eventUri": "eng-9667779", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The late Moses Malone became the first in 1979.

Hakeem Olajuwon led the way with 27.9 points and 11.9 rebounds per game, a stat-line that earned him both the 1994 NBA MVP award and Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThursday night, exclusively on the KPRC 2+ livestream, KPRC 2 Sports Director Randy McIlvoy sits down with Rockets coaching great Rudy Tomjanovich and former player and color analyst Matt Bullard to relive some of the best moments from that season, on the debut of a new show we're calling 'Mic'd up with McIlvoy.'\n\nHow to watch 'Mic'd up with McIlvoy' on the free KPRC 2+ appThe Playoffs\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets faced off against the Portland Trail Blazers, led by Olajuwon's former University of Houston teammate Clyde Drexler. The Rockets took the first two games of the series by double digits, and Olajuwon went off for 49 points in the Game 2 victory.\n\nA strong fourth quarter earned Portland a win in Game 3, but Houston was able to take care of business and advance following a Game 4 win.\n\nEditor's note: First-round series were best-of-5 rather than best-of-7 until the rules were changed in 2003.\n\nSEE ALSO: Rockets earn No. 3 selection in NBA Draft Lottery\n\nIn the second round, the Rockets took on the Phoenix Suns, who were led by All-Stars Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson. Despite two 30+ point performances from Olajuwon, the Rockets dropped the first two games of the series at home.\n\nWith their backs against the wall, Houston won back-to-back games in Phoenix and took the lead in the series after winning Game 5 at home. The Rockets dropped Game 6 in an uncharacteristically poor shooting night but finished things off at The Summit with a 104-94 win in Game 7. In that contest, rookie guard Sam Cassell scored 22 points and dished out seven assists off the bench.\n\nThe Rockets advanced to take on the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals. In Game 1, Olajuwon and Kenny \"The Jet\" Smith scored 31 and 27, respectively, and Houston cruised to a 12-point victory. Game 2 came down to the wire, but Olajuwon led all scorers with 41 points in the Rockets 104-99 win.\n\nThe Jazz got on the board with a win in Game 3, but a late comeback fell just short in Game 4, giving Houston a 3-1 series lead. The Rockets completely smothered the Jazz in Game 5, heading into the half with a commanding 53-35 lead. The Jazz's comeback came up short, and the Rockets comfortably wrapped up the series in five games.\n\nALSO READ: What should the Rockets do with the No. 3 pick? The Finals\n\nGame 1 of the 1994 Finals was a defensive slugfest, with the Rockets squeaking out an 85-78 victory at home. The most notable takeaway from this game was Olajuwon's defense on Knicks' star center Patrick Ewing. The Rockets out-rebounded the Knicks, and Ewing finished with 23 points on just 10-of-26 from the field.\n\nThe Knicks exacted revenge in Game 2, as a strong third quarter made the difference in another tightly contested game. It was the definition of a team win for New York, as all five starters scored double digits. John Starks led the way with 19 points for the Knicks (more on him later).\n\nHouston regained the series advantage in Game 3 with a 93-89 win. It was a neck-and-neck duel between the teams' star centers, but sharpshooting from Houston's role players -- including 15 points of the bench from Cassell -- made the difference for the Rockets.\n\nWith a chance to take a commanding lead in Game 4, the Rockets cooled off a bit. Olajuwon did his job, scoring an efficient 32 points and forcing Ewing to shoot a ghastly 8-for-28 from the field, but no other Rocket scored more than 12 points. The Knicks took full advantage of this off night, with Starks, Derek Harper and Charles Oakley each having solid performances. The Knicks evened the series with a 91-82 dub.\n\nGame 5 is more remembered for what happened away from the court as the game was happening, as many television stations cut away from the action to follow the infamous O.J. Simpson police chase as it transpired live. On the court however, Ewing put up his most efficient performance in the Finals thus far, scoring 25 points on 11-of-21 shooting. The Rockets trailed by 11 points at halftime, but they had climbed back to tie it heading into the fourth quarter. In the fourth, the Rockets ran out of steam and the Knicks took the pivotal game with a 91-84 win.\n\nGame 6 was win-or-go-home for the Rockets, and they delivered when they needed to most. After taking a 46-36 lead into the locker room, Houston held off a late surge from New York to eke out an 86-84 win. Olajuwon led all scorers with 30 points, and power forward Carl Herrera went a perfect 6-of-6 with 12 points off the bench.\n\nGame 7 at The Summit was for all the marbles. It was extremely close all the way through, but the Rockets quietly outscored the Knicks in every quarter, taking home a 90-84 victory to clinch the championship. Olajuwon and Vernon Maxwell led the Rockets offense to a combined 46 points, but it was Starks' nightmarish 2-of-18 shooting performance that truly stifled the Knicks.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon took home Finals MVP in a landslide, averaging 26.9 points and 9.1 boards across the seven games. Maxwell, Cassell and Robert Horry also made their mark across the series, averaging double digits in points.\n\n60 things to know about Hakeem Olajuwon\n\nThe series capped of the very first championship in Rockets' history and put a bow on one of the best seasons by an individual player in NBA history. Hakeem Olajuwon remains one of only three players to win NBA MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP in the same season, along with Michael Jordan and Giannis Antetokounmpo.", "source":

A recent video circulating on social media, shared by former NBA player John Lucas III, showcases Olajuwon training two young players from JL3, Sebastian Williams-Adams and Shelton Henderson.\n\nDressed casually in jeans and a polo shirt, Olajuwon demonstrates his legendary moves, including the famous \"Dream Shake,\" to help young athletes improve their game.\n\nOlajuwon, known for his fluid and deceptive footwork, transformed the role of big men in the NBA. His Dream Shake, a series of fakes and spin moves, made him nearly unstoppable on the court. Even now, his ability to teach and perform these moves remains impressive.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon's illustrious career began when the Houston Rockets selected him as the first overall pick in the 1984 NBA Draft. Teaming up with Ralph Sampson, the duo, known as the \"Twin Towers,\" led the Rockets to the 1986 NBA Finals. After Sampson's departure, Olajuwon became the team's cornerstone, leading the league in rebounds twice and blocks three times.\n\nIn the 1993-94 season, Olajuwon made history by becoming the first player to win the MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP awards in the same season. He led the Rockets to two NBA championships, earning Finals MVP honors both times. His dominance on both ends of the court cemented his legacy as one of the greatest centers in NBA history.\n\nOlajuwon's career stats are remarkable: he played 1,177 regular-season games, averaging 22.5 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 3.2 blocks per game. He holds the NBA record for blocked shots with 3,830 and is the only player to record over 3,000 blocked shots and 2,000 steals in his career.\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Olajuwon continued to impact the basketball world, sharing his knowledge and skills with younger generations. His contributions to the game were recognized with his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016. The Rockets also retired his jersey number 34 in 2002, honoring his significant impact on the franchise.\n\nEven in retirement, Hakeem Olajuwon's influence on the game remains profound, as he continues to inspire and mentor young players with his unparalleled footwork and basketball IQ.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon Didn't Charge Giannis Antetokounmpo For Private Workout\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo clarified that Hakeem Olajuwon did not charge him for their private workout sessions, despite rumors suggesting otherwise. The Milwaukee Bucks star, speaking on SiriusXM Radio, expressed his admiration for Olajuwon, calling him one of the greatest and most skilled big men in NBA history.\n\nAntetokounmpo mentioned that he would have been willing to pay $1 million for the opportunity to train with Olajuwon, given the immense respect he holds for the Hall of Famer. However, Olajuwon never asked for any payment. Giannis emphasized that Olajuwon's willingness to help him improve without expecting compensation was a testament to his character and dedication to the game.\n\nThe Greek Freak pointed out that Olajuwon took time away from his personal life, including his family and other interests, to assist him in honing his skills. Antetokounmpo acknowledged that it would have been reasonable for Olajuwon to charge for his time and expertise, much like any professional service. However, he reiterated that there was no transaction involved in their arrangement.\n\nGiannis also addressed the backlash Olajuwon received for allegedly charging high fees for training sessions. He argued that there is nothing wrong with charging for such services, drawing a parallel to paying for rides on Uber or other professional services. He clarified that while it's fair for Olajuwon to charge others, their mutual respect and recognition of each other's greatness made their situation unique.\n\nAntetokounmpo's remarks put to rest the controversy over Olajuwon's alleged fees and highlighted the generosity and respect between two basketball greats. Olajuwon's decision to train Giannis without charge demonstrates his commitment to mentoring the next generation of players and preserving the legacy of skilled big men in the NBA.\n\nIn the end, the fuss over Hakeem charging exorbitant fees was unfounded. Olajuwon's gesture of offering free workouts to Giannis underscores his dedication to the sport and his respect for Antetokounmpo's talent and achievements.\n\nRelated: Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon Career Comparison (We Have A Winner)\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Still, he did it in relaxed jeans and a polo t-shirt this time.\n\nA recent video of the former 7-footer center is circulating on X (formerly known as Twitter). In it, Olajuwon is spotted in his casual outfit, giving special training to two young talents from JL3, Sebastian and Shelton. The two-time NBA champion shows his legendary moves to the duo to keep the defenders at bay, and they follow suit.\n\nAs soon as former NBA player John Lucas uploaded the clip, the basketball community went gaga over it and gathered in the comment section to express their love and regard for the 61-year-old.\n\nPraising him, a fan wrote, \"Dream working out in jeans and a polo shirt. Classic and All Time Great.\"\n\nWhile another fan stated that they learned the footwork from Olajuwon: \"I literally have chiiiiills watching this! I learned all paint footwork by watching this man.\"\n\n\"The Dream!! One of the best ever! That's a blessing to get coached up by The Dream!!\", added a fan.\n\nSomeone suggested, \"If anyone just wanna work on footwork alone, call this man up.\"\n\n\"To be moving that smoothly at his age, in jeans and a polo on top of that, is simply remarkable,\" an X user said, applauding the big man for his outstanding moves even at this age.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon's NBA journey started with the Houston Rockets 40 years ago. In 1984, when the franchise got an opportunity to select the first pick in the NBA Draft, they got the Nigerian on board, which changed their history.\n\nOlajuwon spent the next 17 seasons with the Rockets and got them their two championship trophies. The Dream dropped massive numbers night after night, gaining multiple individual accolades to decorate his resume.\n\nPlaying for 1,177 regular-season games in the Houston colors, Olajuwon averaged 22.5 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 3.2 blocks. Then, he moved to the Toronto Raptors for a season and announced his retirement. To honor the legend, the Rockets retired his No. 34 jersey.\n\nSince then, the franchise has been eagerly waiting to sign a talent of his caliber who could push them to the top of the table again.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Olajuwon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lucas_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Lucas II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hakeem-Olajuwon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669417", "eventUri": "eng-9669417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

They defeated the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals in seven games.\n\nThe championship was an exhilarating moment for a city that had experienced more than its fair share of sports disappointments (with more to come). For example, the Oilers had blown big leads in the NFL Playoffs several times before the franchise's ultimate disappointment -- leaving the city altogether following the 1996 season.\n\nRELATED: Some Highs, and a Whole Lot of Lows: Reflecting on Houston's Difficult Sports History\n\nJeff Balke, who writes for Houston Press and co-hosts the Bleav in Astros podcast, told Houston Matters producer Celeste Schurman things were different back then. The Astros hadn't yet had their dominant stretch of playoff runs and two World Series wins.\n\n\"Houston was not considered a great sports town at the time,\" he said. \"...Houston didn't really have the sort of swagger that is has now about itself. It was a very self-conscious city...having any kind of title was a big deal here.\"\n\nThe Rockets were led by future Hall of Fame center and University of Houston alumnus Hakeem Olajuwon. Alongside him were the likes of Kenny Smith, Vernon Maxwell, Robert Horry, Mario Elie, Otis Thorpe, and Sam Cassell. The team's head coach was Rudy Tomjanovich, who himself entered the Hall of Fame as a coach.\n\nRELATED: The Punch: How an Infamous Moment in Houston Sports Changed Basketball Forever\n\nWhile many Houstonians will never forget that title run and what it meant for the city, there are plenty of new and younger Houstonians who might need a refresher on this important landmark in the city's sports history, on its 30th anniversary.\n\n10 THINGS TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE ROCKETS FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP:\n\n1. Blasting Off -- The 1993-1994 Rockets started the regular season blistering hot, going 15-0 and winning 22 of their first 23 games. They finished the regular season with a record of 58-24, winning the Midwest Division and entering the playoffs as the second overall seed in the Western Conference.\n\n2. Historic MVP Season -- Olajuwon was named the NBA MVP that season, becoming the first player born outside the United States to do so. And he would become the first player to win that award in the same season where he also was named NBA Finals MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and won the championship.\n\n3. Going from \"Choke City\" to \"Clutch City\" -- In the second round of the playoffs, the Rockets blew big leads and lost the first two games to the lower-seeded Phoenix Suns. After the Game 2 loss, the Houston Chronicle declared \"Choke City\" in a front-page headline.\n\nHowever, when Houston rallied to win the series and eventually the championship, the city's other newspaper, The Houston Post, ran a headline declaring \"Clutch City,\" a nickname that's still used today.\n\nIn fact, when the Rockets added a new mascot in 1995, the team named him Clutch the Bear.\n\nRELATED: Into Hibernation: Why the Man Behind Clutch the Rockets' Bear is Stepping Away\n\n4. A Very Different Kind of Fast Break -- One thing fans who watched the NBA Finals on television that year will never forget is how on June 17, 1994, NBC interrupted its broadcast of Game 5 to air live footage of the O.J. Simpson police chase.\n\nThe former NFL star and actor was reportedly holding a gun to his own head and suicidal in the back of a white Ford Bronco driven by his friend, A.C. Cowlings, on a freeway in Los Angeles as police cruisers followed. This was after an investigation into the murders of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.\n\n\"For Rockets and Knicks fans, that was something that we were not real thrilled about,\" Balke said.\n\n5. The Atmosphere in the City -- Balke recalled how, especially after defeating Phoenix, the city became extremely galvanized behind the team.\n\n\"You couldn't really go anywhere without seeing Rockets shirts, Rockets hats. There were buildings that were decorated with Rockets stuff,\" he said. \"It was a very, very big deal -- as much as you would've seen when the Astros were winning their championships. It was very similar to that.\"\n\nMORE: 100 Things Rockets Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die\n\n6. How the Game and the Team Was Different -- Today, teams shoot a lot of 3-pointers and score a lot more points. Back then, the league was dominated by big men in the middle, and the game was a lot more defensive-minded.\n\nWhile the Rockets had the game's most dominant center in Olajuwon, Balke said Tomjanovich encouraged players like him to give up the ball when they were double-teamed, kicking the ball out to a cast of deadly long-range shooters, like Elie, Horry, Smith, Maxwell, and Cassell.\n\n7. New York vs. Houston -- The NBA Finals pitted the nation's largest city against its fourth largest. It pitted a city and a team with many championships under its belt against a city and a team searching for its first (of the modern era of major sports leagues, at least).\n\nAt one point, The New York Post (always known for its subtlety) called Houston a \"hell hole.\"\n\n\"It was a very intense rivalry and a very intense time in basketball, particularly here in Houston,\" Balke said.\n\n8. Ugly Ball -- The finals was a grinding, back-and-forth, defensive-minded, low-scoring affair that went the full seven games, leading Sports Illustrated to call the series \"ugly ball,\" Balke said.\n\nScoring totals in most of the games were in the 80-point range and never reached 100 points.\n\nIn Game 6, with New York leading the series 3-2, Knicks guard John Starks had been on fire from the field. In the the final moments, Starks put up a 3-point attempt that would've likely ended the series. But Olajuwon blocked that attempt to preserve the win and send the series to a deciding seventh game.\n\n9. How the City Responded -- After the Rockets held on to beat the Knicks in Game 7 by a score of 90-84 and win the title, Balke says he was struck by how fans in the city reacted and celebrated. In some other cities, celebrations have turned riotous, cars have gotten flipped over, and things have been set on fire.\n\n\"Houston was exactly the opposite,\" Balke said. \"It was a really euphoric sort of feeling.\"\n\nLike many other Houstonians, he drove into the city to celebrate with the throngs of fans who'd congregated along Richmond Avenue near Greenway Plaza.\n\n\"People were leaping into the back of my truck and diving into my window and hugging me,\" he said. \"And, you know, there were people dancing in the middle of the street.\"\n\n10. A Turning Point for the City -- The 1994 championship came on the heels of an oil bust and a time when the city was transforming from a more blue-collar oil town to a more white-collar city. Balke said the win felt like a turning point for a city many outsiders saw as flat, hot, and ugly.\n\n\"A lot of Houstonians were self-conscious about that,\" he said. \"I think this gave us something to kind of hang our collective hats on and say, 'Hey, maybe we're not as bad as we thought we were.'\"\n\nOf course, the Rockets went on to win the championship again the following year, a playoff run Balke says is even more interesting than the first title, as the team faced more adversity (beginning the playoffs as a much lower seed) and featured the addition of University of Houston alum Clyde Drexler to the team.", "source": {"uri": "houstonpublicmedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Houston Public Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_hagerty@houstonpublicmedia.org", "name": "Michael

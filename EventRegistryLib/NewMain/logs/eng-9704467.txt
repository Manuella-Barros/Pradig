Once they decided to start the camp, drivers, industry veterans and fans were all eager to contribute in any way they could.\n\n\"Everybody wants to leave a legacy of some kind,\" Petty said. \"I think that, racing over a period of time, will go away or be different.

We make sure they get there and get them home. So when I look at the Pettys' 75 years of racing, I think it brought the camp into play and I think the bigger legacy, what it will hopefully be, is more about the Victory Junction Camp than anything about racing.\n\n\"Racing put us in a position to come out and do something and it was always one of Adam's dreams,\" he added. \"When we lost Adam, the family got together and said we'd go pursue that deal.\"\n\nAdam Petty was the oldest son of Kyle Petty, Richard's only son.

Not too many years before, he'd made a motorcycle visit to Paul Newman's Camp Boggy Creek and became interested in creating a similar camp in North Carolina.\n\nPeople are also reading...

We make sure they get there and get them home. So when I look at the Pettys' 75 years of racing, I think it brought the camp into play and I think the bigger legacy, what it will hopefully be, is more about the Victory Junction Camp than anything about racing.\n\n\"Racing put us in a position to come out and do something and it was always one of Adam's dreams,\" he added. \"When we lost Adam, the family got together and said we'd go pursue that deal.\"\n\nAdam Petty was the oldest son of Kyle Petty, Richard's only son.

The trio are all members of NASCAR's Hall of Fame.\n\nRichard Petty is \"The King\" and he remains a larger-than-life figure in retirement, his cowboy hat and sunglasses a beloved and familiar sight at the track, where even at 87 he shows up to every NASCAR weekend and is currently an ambassador for Legacy Motor Club. That team, co-owned by fellow seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson, is the backbone of Petty Enterprises.\n\nKyle Petty never equaled his father in on-track success but Adam was considered to be a future NASCAR star at the time of his fatal crash. Although winless at the national series level when he was killed, he'd made one Cup start and had won two races in the ARCA Series feeder system when he was 17.\n\nHad he not died so young, Adam Petty likely would have moved to the Cup level to drive for Petty Enterprises and kept that team afloat and competitive for several decades.\n\nInstead, his death helped the family create its proudest achievement.\n\nLocated across 84 acres in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, the camp notes that \"Adam's passion for racing was equaled only by his compassion for others, especially children\" and that he often visited children in pediatric hospitals.\n\nThe camp is largely funded through donations and money-raising events that include both a fan walk and the annual \"Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America.\" The motorcycle trip began in 1995, long before the camp, but proceeds now go to Victory Junction.\n\nRichard Petty said it thrills him that Victory Junction began long before foundations and charities started by drivers became the norm.\n\n\"We had a grandson that we loved, but look at the thousands of kids -- I think we've seen 30,000 kids and this is our 20th year, and Kyle always says when he sees one of them smile, he sees Adam smile,\" Richard Petty said.\n\nPetty is adamant that the family never would have been able to launch Victory Junction without the success of Petty Enterprises, which was NASCAR's winningest team until 2021.

He pointed to the Victory Junction Gang Camp, which was opened in 2004 for chronically ill children as a way to honor his late grandson.\n\nAdam Petty was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash practicing for a race at New Hampshire. Not too many years before, he'd made a motorcycle visit to Paul Newman's Camp Boggy Creek and became interested in creating a similar camp in North Carolina.\n\nPetty said the family following through on Adam's dream will be the family's lasting legacy.\n\n''This is for seriously ill kids who can't go to camp, so it's a very special deal,'' Petty said. \"The kids come from all over the country and they don't charge them anything. We make sure they get there and get them home. So when I look at the Pettys' 75 years of racing, I think it brought the camp into play and I think the bigger legacy, what it will hopefully be, is more about the Victory Junction Camp than anything about racing.\n\n''Racing put us in a position to come out and do something and it was always one of Adam's dreams,\" he added. \"When we lost Adam, the family got together and said we'd go pursue that deal.''\n\nAdam Petty was the oldest son of Kyle Petty, Richard's only son. Petty family patriarch Lee started the racing team, and Richard's engine-building brother, Maurice, are all considered the foundation of the team's success. The trio are all members of NASCAR's Hall of Fame.\n\nRichard Petty is ''The King'' and he remains a larger-than-life figure in retirement, his cowboy hat and sunglasses a beloved and familiar sight at the track, where even at 87 he shows up to every NASCAR weekend and is currently an ambassador for Legacy Motor Club. That team, co-owned by fellow seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson, is the backbone of Petty Enterprises.\n\nKyle Petty never equaled his father in on-track success but Adam was considered to be a future NASCAR star at the time of his fatal crash. Although winless at the national series level when he was killed, he'd made one Cup start and had won two races in the ARCA Series feeder system when he was 17.\n\nHad he not died so young, Adam Petty likely would have moved to the Cup level to drive for Petty Enterprises and kept that team afloat and competitive for several decades.\n\nInstead, his death helped the family create its proudest achievement.\n\nLocated across 84 acres in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, the camp notes that ''Adam's passion for racing was equaled only by his compassion for others, especially children\" and that he often visited children in pediatric hospitals.\n\nThe camp is largely funded through donations and money-raising events that include both a fan walk and the annual ''Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America.\" The motorcycle trip began in 1995, long before the camp, but proceeds now go to Victory Junction.\n\nRichard Petty said it thrills him that Victory Junction began long before foundations and charities started by drivers became the norm.\n\n''We had a grandson that we loved, but look at the thousands of kids -- I think we've seen 30,000 kids and this is our 20th year, and Kyle always says when he sees one of them smile, he sees Adam smile,'' Richard Petty said.\n\nPetty is adamant that the family never would have been able to launch Victory Junction without the success of Petty Enterprises, which was NASCAR's winningest team until 2021. Once they decided to start the camp, drivers, industry veterans and fans were all eager to contribute in any way they could.\n\n''Everybody wants to leave a legacy of some kind,'' Petty said. ''I think that, racing over a period of time, will go away or be different. I think the notoriety of the camp is going to be around a lot longer than anything I've accomplished in racing.''", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Petty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Petty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Petty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Petty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Petty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Petty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_car_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock car racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Newman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_Motor_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legacy Motor Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmie Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_Enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petty Enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCA_Menards_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ARCA Menards Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randleman,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randleman, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Randleman, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1719329587", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704467", "eventUri": "eng-9704467", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

Relive some of the most important moments in the NASCAR Hall of Famer's storied career in this Best of NASCAR YouTube compilation.\n\nRichard Petty, with a record 200 Cup Series wins, seven championships and a first-ballot inductee into the Hall of Fame, is considered NASCAR's greatest driver.\n\nHe is spending the season celebrating 75 years of NASCAR participation by his famous family -- basically since the inception of the stock car series in 1948 -- and reflecting on the legacy that will be left behind.\n\nAs he approached his 87th birthday, celebrated Tuesday ahead of this weekend's race at Chicago, Petty has realized that his family should be hailed for something far bigger than anything it did in NASCAR. He pointed to the Victory Junction Gang Camp, which was opened in 2004 for chronically ill children as a way to honor his late grandson.\n\nAdam Petty was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash practicing for a race at New Hampshire. Not too many years before, he'd made a motorcycle visit to Paul Newman's Camp Boggy Creek and became interested in creating a similar camp in North Carolina.\n\nPeople are also reading...

We make sure they get there and get them home. So when I look at the Pettys' 75 years of racing, I think it brought the camp into play and I think the bigger legacy, what it will hopefully be, is more about the Victory Junction Camp than anything about racing.\n\n\"Racing put us in a position to come out and do something and it was always one of Adam's dreams,\" he added. \"When we lost Adam, the family got together and said we'd go pursue that deal.\"\n\nAdam Petty was the oldest son of Kyle Petty, Richard's only son. Petty family patriarch Lee started the racing team, and Richard's engine-building brother, Maurice, are all considered the foundation of the team's success. The trio are all members of NASCAR's Hall of Fame.\n\nRichard Petty is \"The King\" and he remains a larger-than-life figure in retirement, his cowboy hat and sunglasses a beloved and familiar sight at the track, where even at 87 he shows up to every NASCAR weekend and is currently an ambassador for Legacy Motor Club. That team, co-owned by fellow seven-time Cup champion Jimmie Johnson, is the backbone of Petty Enterprises.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nKyle Petty never equaled his father in on-track success but Adam was considered to be a future NASCAR star at the time of his fatal crash. Although winless at the national series level when he was killed, he'd made one Cup start and had won two races in the ARCA Series feeder system when he was 17.\n\nHad he not died so young, Adam Petty likely would have moved to the Cup level to drive for Petty Enterprises and kept that team afloat and competitive for several decades.\n\nInstead, his death helped the family create its proudest achievement.\n\nLocated across 84 acres in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, the camp notes that \"Adam's passion for racing was equaled only by his compassion for others, especially children\" and that he often visited children in pediatric hospitals.\n\nThe camp is largely funded through donations and money-raising events that include both a fan walk and the annual \"Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America.\" The motorcycle trip began in 1995, long before the camp, but proceeds now go to Victory Junction.\n\nRichard Petty said it thrills him that Victory Junction began long before foundations and charities started by drivers became the norm.\n\n\"We had a grandson that we loved, but look at the thousands of kids -- I think we've seen 30,000 kids and this is our 20th year, and Kyle always says when he sees one of them smile, he sees Adam smile,\" Richard Petty said.\n\nPetty is adamant that the family never would have been able to launch Victory Junction without the success of Petty Enterprises, which was NASCAR's winningest team until 2021. Once they decided to start the camp, drivers, industry veterans and fans were all eager to contribute in any way they could.\n\n\"Everybody wants to leave a legacy of some kind,\" Petty said. \"I think that, racing over a period of time, will go away or be different. I think the notoriety of the camp is going to be around a lot longer than anything I've accomplished in racing.\"\n\nSports Week in Pictures: Soccer fans dance in the rain at Euro 2024 Love 0 Funny 0

As summer rolled in, few, if any, could have predicted the storm that was coming in the form of a string of seminal albums including Pearl Jam's Ten and, a month later, Nirvana's Nevermind. Amid this changing of the guard, Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers faced perhaps the most pivotal period of their decade-and-a-half career. After flying solo on Full Moon Fever, Petty reunited with The Heartbreakers for this 90s rock'n'roll classic, Into The Great Wide Open, on July 2, 1991.\n\nListen to Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers' Into the Great Wide Open now.\n\nJust two years earlier, Petty showcased his prowess on his solo debut, Full Moon Fever, an album that contained several of his most iconic tracks, including \"I Won't Back Down,\" \"Runnin' Down A Dream,\" and \"Free Fallin'\", which remain rock radio staples decades later. The album came in the aftermath of a 1987 fire, in which Petty lost everything when his house was burned down by an arsonist; it offered a new perspective and a sonic lease on his career.\n\nGiving traditionalist rock'n'roll a modern sheen\n\nWith the alt.rock boom on the horizon, it would have been easy for Petty and The Heartbreakers to take a sharp turn, perhaps channeling a band like R.E.M. Instead, they added a modern sheen to traditionalist rock'n'roll and thrust themselves back into the mainstream rock conversation.\n\nWhen it came time for Petty to reconvene The Heartbreakers, in the early 90s, the singer-songwriter had a wealth of momentum to carry him through. Enlisting Full Moon Fever producer Jeff Lynne, of ELO fame, Petty and Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell helmed the band's eighth studio effort.\n\nUnder the trio's production stewardship, the Into The Great Wide Open sessions continued where Full Moon Fever left off. Fusing the Laurel Canyon sound with heartland rock, the album was a critical and commercial success, reaching No.13 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nA beautiful simplicity\n\nWhen it was released, Into the Great Wide Open was praised as a return to form for Petty and The Heartbreakers. In particular, \"Learning To Fly\" and the title track were widely seen as logical steps forward from Petty's previous album. Even with its sparse, four-chord arrangement, \"Learning To Fly\" illustrates how much Petty could do with a seemingly simple song, turning it into a soaring anthem. The Jeff Lynne-produced single was a smashing success, landing at No.28 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song. In a career chock-full of hits, it became Petty's most successful single, chart-wise, since 1981's \"The Waiting.\"\n\nAlong with \"Learning To Fly,\" the success of Into The Great Wide Open was very much driven by the title track, a cautionary tale about a young dreamer who comes to Los Angeles and gets taken by the record industry. It's a familiar tale to all, but with Petty's evocative lyricism and dark wit, he proves himself to be a master storyteller with just a few words to spare. The track's success was certainly helped by its star-studded music video, starring Johnny Depp as the \"rebel without a clue\" and special cameos by Faye Dunaway, Terence Trent D'Arby, Chynna Phillips, and Matt LeBlanc. Petty even told Rolling Stone that he experienced \"people coming to me wanting to make it into a movie.\"\n\nBut there's more to Into The Great Wide Open than its breakthrough singles. Petty and the band are in top form, whether it's on the classic road trip song \"Kings Highway,\" with its shimmering reverb, or the anti-war track \"Two Gunslingers,\" a jangly single about walking away from a fight no one asked for that was widely interpreted as commentary on the first Gulf War. There's a niggling sense of wanderlust on the record, from the persistent search for fame on the title track, \"Kings Highway\"'s invocation of the open road, and an urge to return \"You And I Will Meet Again.\"\n\nLooking forward\n\nMost importantly, from a mainstream standpoint, Into The Great Wide Open allowed Petty and The Heartbreakers to retain their spot as one of the most consistently brilliant bands in rock. A huge success commercially, with its stylized production and sonic evolution from Full Moon Fever, the album became a vital part of Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers' catalogue.\n\nWhile Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers first burst onto the music scene as wily upstarts in the 70s and dominated FM radio in the 80s, Into The Great Wide Open propelled them into another decade of relevancy and classic rock-minded dominance.\n\nThey'd have a major hit with \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\" on 1993's Greatest Hits package, and 1994's Wildflowers was another career achievement for Petty, but none of that would have been possible without the success of Into The Great Wide Open. Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers occupy a rare circle of artists who have maintained consecutive decades of relevance without repeating the same formula. Thanks to his band of brothers and producer muse, Into The Great Wide Open cemented Petty status as master of the pop hook and one of rock'n'roll's greatest stewards.", "source": {"uri":

When he decided to reunite the Heartbreakers for the 1991 album Into the Great Wide Open, he brought Lynne along as a producer.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThe result is a hybrid album that sounds like nothing else in the Heartbreakers' catalog. Let's look back at how it all came together and how the participants involved sometimes struggled with the arrangement.\n\nPetty, Lynne, and a Band in Waiting\n\nA chance encounter between Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne on a Los Angeles street one afternoon turned into a deep friendship and lucrative working relationship. They had already met briefly in London in the company of George Harrison, but the LA meetup was pure chance and, seemingly, fate. The timing couldn't have been better, as both men were struggling with the constraints of being bandleaders. Lynne had thoughts of focusing on production after shelving ELO, and Petty, a huge fan of Lynne's work, thought they should work together.\n\nThat led to Full Moon Fever, which indirectly led to The Traveling Wilburys. A lot of great music was being made by Petty and Lynne, often as co-writers. As the 1980s turned to the '90s, Petty wasn't too keen on stopping this productive partnership anytime soon. The only problem was there was a band of his that was waiting around for his return.\n\nIn actuality, the men of the Heartbreakers hadn't been idly sitting on their hands after Let Me Up (I've Had Enough), the last band album before Petty went solo in 1987. They were all in-demand session men. In one interesting quirk, the 1990 Grammys pitted Full Moon Fever against Don Henley's The End of the Innocence, which featured major contributions from Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Stan Lynch, for Album of the Year. (Both lost to Bonnie Raitt's Nick of Time.)\n\nPetty knew it was time to get the Heartbreakers back together. But he also wanted to keep his stretch of working with Lynne intact. The solution: Have Lynne produce the next Heartbreakers record, which would be entitled Into the Great Wide Open.\n\n\"Open\" Season\n\nOn paper, the pairing of Lynne, one of rock's most distinctive production minds, and the Heartbreakers, a collective of stellar individual players who possessed unmistakable chemistry when playing with each other, seemed like a smash success waiting to happen. As it turned out, it wasn't exactly smooth sailing.\n\nThe main bone of contention was how Lynne preferred to make records. He liked to build up tracks through overdubs of individual instrumental parts. This wasn't an issue with Full Moon Fever, since that record was mostly comprised of Petty, Lynne, and Mike Campbell playing all the instruments (save drums, which were handled by occasional Heartbreakers' percussionist Phil Jones).\n\nBut the Heartbreakers were used to getting together in a room and working through Petty's songs, finding the proper groove and arrangement by playing them as a unit. Although they eventually came around to Lynne's way of doing things, it was a somewhat bumpy road to get there.\n\nAnd how does the record hold up today? Well, a Jeff Lynne-produced album tends to have a sound about it that overrides whatever techniques or styles the individual players bring to it. Full Moon Fever worked because Petty trimmed his lyrics to such succinct, melodic, fighting shape they ideally fit Lynne's production style.\n\nThe Sum of Its Parts\n\nInto the Great Wide Open, on the other hand, sometimes feels lost between approaches. The simpler lyrics mostly remain, but Petty tries to expand the arrangements in order to make the band feel more integral. It leads to moments like the title track, which meanders rather than surges, or \"All or Nothin',\" where some of the bluesier edges are a bit too smoothed-over.\n\nThat said, there are moments of undeniable brilliance when everything comes together. Lead track \"Learning to Fly\" shimmers, as Lynne's gloss is the ideal compliment to the rhythmic churn of the band. And then there's \"All the Wrong Reasons,\" one of the great underrated tracks in the Petty catalog. Mike Campbell's bouzouki licks lend the song the air of myth, but Petty's lyrics tell a very modern tale of a family torn asunder by financial pressures.\n\nPetty would only do one more album with Lynne (Highway Companion in 2006), and, like Full Moon Fever, it would be mostly sans Heartbreakers (save Campbell once again). Into the Great Wide Open thus stands as a bit of an outlier, trapped between a Petty/Lynne combo effort and a Heartbreakers' joint. It might not be more than the sum of its parts, but it's never less than intriguing as clashing style sometimes coexist beautifully, and sometimes struggle against one another in a battle for the soul of Petty's songs.\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nPhoto by Karl Walter/Getty Images", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType":

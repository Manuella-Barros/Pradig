(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a \"drug addict\" whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 by saying he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\n\"You will see that he is not guilty,\" attorney Abbe Lowell said.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer. They also played for jurors an audio excerpt of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" in which he talked about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict,\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden, who attended Monday's court session, joined him in the courtroom again as opening statements began. Hunter Biden's exes are also expected to testify on embarrassing and personal details about addiction.\n\nLowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nAnd his state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.''\n\nLowell told the jury that prosecutors have to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly violated the law.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart.

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom as openings began.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken centre stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay US$1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offences to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defence table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Conn.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the spectre of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca",

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a clear drug addict whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said.\n\n\"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\nHines said \"addiction is depressing\" but that Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom as opening statements began.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City.

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a \"drug addict\" whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 by saying he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\n\"You will see that he is not guilty,\" attorney Abbe Lowell said.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer. They also played for jurors an audio excerpt of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" in which he talked about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict,\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden, who attended Monday's court session, joined him in the courtroom again as opening statements began. Hunter Biden's exes are also expected to testify on embarrassing and personal details about addiction.\n\nLowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nAnd his state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.''\n\nLowell told the jury that prosecutors have to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly violated the law.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart.

Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(Associated Press Archives)\n\nFederal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a \"drug addict\" whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer. They also played for jurors an audio excerpt of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" where he talks about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden, who attended Monday's court session, joined him in the courtroom again as opening statements began.\n\nDefense attorney Abbe Lowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nAnd his state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.''\n\nHe told the jury that prosecutors have to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly violated the law.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.", "source": {"uri": "americanpress.com",

(AP) -- Lawyers are making opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter in a trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly personal details about his struggle with addiction.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, on Tuesday morning, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a \"drug addict\" whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer. They also played for jurors an audio excerpt of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" where he talks about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden, who attended Monday's court session, joined him in the courtroom again as opening statements began.\n\nDefense attorney Abbe Lowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nAnd his state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.''\n\nHe told the jury that prosecutors have to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly violated the law.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- Lawyers began making opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter in a trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly personal details about his struggle with addiction.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom as openings began.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women, plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nMuch of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case. They dismissed those with strong thoughts on drug use or who might want to tighten regulations on firearms.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Washington and Fatima Hussein aboard Air Force One contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a clear drug addict whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said.\n\n\"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\nHines said \"addiction is depressing\" but that Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.

The son of President Joe Biden has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges. The trial's testimony may include details from his autobiography and incriminating messages.\n\nHunter Biden arrived for his criminal trial on gun charges will begin on Tuesday, ahead of opening statements and potentially lurid testimony about drug use from his autobiography and phone messages that prosecutors say incriminates the president's son. Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of failing to disclose his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and of illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the three felony charges. Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried. Hunter Biden did not speak to reporters as he entered court on Tuesday.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime. The trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance. U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\" Prosecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict. Weiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House. Hunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Noreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

(AP) - Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial while the first lady watched from the courtroom and the president sent a message of support. Hunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. Hunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom. The proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son. The trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign. Jury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C. People just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer. Some prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case. One potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports. \"It's not a good one,\"\u009d she said. Another was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\u009d But much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms - some of the very people Biden counts as constituents. The panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner. Hunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings. But Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted. Opening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings. The Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories. The president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump. In a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\u009d \"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\"\u009d he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\u009d The first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut. Aboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\u009d \"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\"\u009d said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded. Biden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week. The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs. If convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars. Trump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order. ___ Long reported from Washington.

His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer.\n\nHe bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it is unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan Merchan, who raised the spectre of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.", "source": {"uri": "thenorthernecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Northern Echo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden",

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said.\n\n\"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\nHines said \"addiction is depressing\" but that Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom as opening statements began.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.", "source": {"uri":

Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\n\" READ MORE: Jury is chosen in Hunter Biden's federal firearms case and opening statements are set for Tuesday\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator there, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally; others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it only took a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, on her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife Melissa and sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job and replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first, and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings' conclusion.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week.

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a \"drug addict\" whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer. They also played for jurors an audio excerpt of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" where he talks about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden, who attended Monday's court session, joined him in the courtroom again as opening statements began.\n\nDefense attorney Abbe Lowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nAnd his state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.''\n\nHe told the jury that prosecutors have to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly violated the law.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M.

(AP) - Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a clear drug addict whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction. Hunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. Prosecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form. \"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\"\u009d federal prosecutor Derek Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\" Hines said \"addiction is depressing\" but that Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nLawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial while the first lady watched from the courtroom and the president sent a message of support.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net",

Prosecutors, the attorney said, must prove he knowingly violated the law.\n\n\"You will see that he is not guilty,\" attorney Abbe Lowell said in opening statements.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase of the Colt revolver when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe case is dredging up painful memories for the president and his family, and revealing new and highly personal details about their struggles as the 2024 election looms, all while the first lady and Hunter Biden's sister Ashley watch from the front row of the courtroom.\n\nJurors will hear testimony from the president's brother James Biden, who is close with Hunter and helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past. They will also hear how Hallie Biden, the widow of the president's late son, also became addicted to crack during a brief relationship with Hunter. She took the gun from Hunter Biden and tossed it into the garbage at a nearby market, afraid of what he might do with it. The gun was later found by someone collecting cans and eventually turned over to police.\n\nThe president was in Washington as the opening statements were delivered. He announced an immigration order and hosted a picnic for congressional leaders before a scheduled departure for France later in the day. He will be gone the rest of the week. First lady Jill Biden planned to meet him in Europe.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been protective and deeply concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nProsecutors set the stage for their case by playing for jurors audio excerpts of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" in which Hunter, in his own narration, talks about about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase and his descent into drugs following the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015 from cancer.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines told the jury in his opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict,\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nLowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nHis state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.\"\n\nLowell also blamed Hunter's problems with the firearm on Hallie's disposal of it.\n\n\"After he bought the gun, Hunter did nothing with it,\" Lowell said. The gun became a problem only because of what Hallie Biden did.\n\nLowell cautioned the jury that their duty was solemn and reminded them: \"The charges against Hunter are not minor. They are serious.\"\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nGarland on Tuesday faced members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a clear drug addict whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack.

The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart.

And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial.\n\nREAD MORE: Prospective jurors in Hunter Biden's firearms case questioned on gun rights, addiction, politics\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nEducate your inbox\n\nSubscribe to Here's the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nEmail Address Subscribe Form error message goes here.\n\nThank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democrat President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they might call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents for calling a payment to attorney Michael Cohen a legal expense. Cohen had paid off Stormy Daniels to keep Democrats' efforts of tarnishing Trump before the election out of the news, but it was ultimately widely shared and Trump now faces prison time for a misdemeanor outside the statue of limitations that Democrats managed to get a jury to convict him on a felony for.\n\nHunter Biden's trial might begin to shift media attention on Biden family malfeasance. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He also faces federal tax charges in California.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ended the day by swearing in the 12 jurors and four alternates. \"Your job is to find the facts,\" she told them and instructed them not to discuss the case with anyone, even among themselves.\n\nThe case is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years of crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nRepublicans have seized on Hunter Biden's troubles to try to shift attention away from Trump's own legal woes. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases.\n\nJill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden were in attendance. Wilmington is the Bidens' hometown.\n\n\"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that a lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction.\n\nCongressional Republicans spent years in vain trying to find evidence of a corrupt link between Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, including work for Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and his father's political power.\n\nJurors disclose personal experience with addiction\n\nThe jurors included several who disclosed personal experience with drug addiction. One impaneled juror had a friend who overdosed and another, selected as an alternate, whose uncle's drug use led to jail time.\n\n\"I feel like it's an everyday part of the world,\" said the alternate juror of substance abuse.\n\nFew jurors expressed strong political views but a handful said they were acquainted with members of the extended Biden family.\n\nOne potential juror said she and her husband were acquainted with Hunter Biden. \"Wilmington is a small place,\" the potential juror told the judge before being dismissed.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden spent the weekend with his father in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the pair biking and attending church together on Saturday.\n\nGun purchase\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box for \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nProsecution lawyers disclosed in court filings that they may use details gleaned from Hunter Biden's phone and iCloud account, including photos of him smoking crack and messages with drug dealers. They said they may call as a witness his former wife Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they may try to show he had completed a drug rehabilitation program before purchasing the gun and may have considered his answer on the gun purchase form to be truthful.\n\nA plea agreement that would have resolved the gun and tax charges without prison time collapsed last year after Noreika questioned the extent of the immunity it extended to Hunter Biden.\n\nHis lawyers blamed Republican pressure for the failure of the plea agreement.\n\nNoreika, a Trump appointee to the bench, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut the defendant's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said the defense could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorders might not consider themselves an addict.\n\nThat testimony could have helped Biden show that he did not know he was lying on the background check form. The government is required to prove that Biden knowingly lied.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as deceptive and driven by addiction, a man whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney argued that his client did not believe he had a drug problem when he stated in the paperwork that he was not in the throes of addiction. Prosecutors, the attorney said, must prove he knowingly violated the law.\n\n\"You will see that he is not guilty,\" attorney Abbe Lowell said in opening statements.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase of the Colt revolver when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe case is dredging up painful memories for the president and his family, and revealing new and highly personal details about their struggles as the 2024 election looms, all while the first lady and Hunter Biden's sister Ashley watch from the front row of the courtroom.\n\nJurors will hear testimony from the president's brother James Biden, who is close with Hunter and helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past. They will also hear how Hallie Biden, the widow of the president's late son, also became addicted to crack during a brief relationship with Hunter. She took the gun from Hunter Biden and tossed it into the garbage at a nearby market, afraid of what he might do with it. The gun was later found by someone collecting cans and eventually turned over to police.\n\nThe president was in Washington as the opening statements were delivered. He announced an immigration order and hosted a picnic for congressional leaders before a scheduled departure for France later in the day. He will be gone the rest of the week. First lady Jill Biden planned to meet him in Europe.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been protective and deeply concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nProsecutors set the stage for their case by playing for jurors audio excerpts of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" in which Hunter, in his own narration, talks about about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase and his descent into drugs following the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015 from cancer.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines told the jury in his opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict,\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nLowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nHis state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.\"\n\nLowell also blamed Hunter's problems with the firearm on Hallie's disposal of it.\n\n\"After he bought the gun, Hunter did nothing with it,\" Lowell said. The gun became a problem only because of what Hallie Biden did.\n\nLowell cautioned the jury that their duty was solemn and reminded them: \"The charges against Hunter are not minor. They are serious.\"\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nGarland on Tuesday faced members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Washington and Fatima Hussein aboard Air Force One contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nBy Tom Hals\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Hunter Biden's criminal trial on gun charges will begin in earnest on Tuesday with opening statements and potentially lurid testimony about drug use from his autobiography and phone messages that prosecutors say incriminates the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of failing to disclose his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and of illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the three felony charges. Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

(AP) -- Lawyers are making opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter in a trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly personal details about his struggle with addiction.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, on Tuesday morning, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, on Tuesday morning, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.",

(AP) -- Lawyers are making opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter in a trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly personal details about his struggle with addiction.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, on Tuesday morning, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nBy Tom Hals and Jack Queen\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -Hunter Biden arrived for his criminal trial on gun charges on Tuesday, ahead of opening statements and potentially lurid testimony about drug use lifted from his autobiography and phone messages that prosecutors say incriminates the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden, 54, is accused of failing to disclose his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and of illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the three felony charges. Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nHunter Biden did not speak to reporters as he entered court on Tuesday. He was accompanied at the trial by First Lady Jill Biden and his wife.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nNoreika announced a juror had been \"lost\" before the start of Tuesday's proceeding. The judge said the juror begged to be dismissed because she lived an hour away and didn't have a car, job or money for parking.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in\n\nstate court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; Editing by Scott Malone, Leslie Adler and Nick Zieminski)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nHunter Biden did not speak to reporters as he entered court on Tuesday. He was accompanied at the trial by First Lady Jill Biden and his wife.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 US election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told US District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nUS Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nNoreika announced a juror had been \"lost\" before the start of today's proceeding. The judge said the juror begged to be dismissed because she lived an hour away and didn't have a car, job or money for parking.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict. -- Reuters", "source":

He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender jail time is unlikely.\n\nPresident Biden said on Monday that his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of hard-right Republicans, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. No charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republican lawmakers to initiate impeachment proceedings against Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator there, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally; others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it only took a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, on her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife Melissa and sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job and replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first, and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings' conclusion.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to centre on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor-league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.", "source": {"uri":

Hunter Biden faces three felony charges related to a 2018 firearm purchase during a period when he admits in his memoir to struggling with a crack addiction.\n\nHe stands accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, falsely claiming on the application that he wasn't a drug user, and illegally possessing the gun for 11 days. The trial follows the breakdown of a deal with prosecutors that would have sidestepped the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.\n\nRead more: Biden claims 'convicted felon' Trump is running for office to 'preserve his freedoms'\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and argues that he's being unjustly targeted by the Justice Department following Republican outcry over the now-defunct plea deal as preferential treatment for the Democratic president's son. Hunter Biden has long been a target of attack by Republicans attempting to hit the President by proxy.\n\nThis trial is taking place just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was found guilty of 34 felonies in New York City. While the two criminal cases are unrelated, their timing highlights how the courts have become a focal point during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection for Hunter Biden's case was swiftly completed on Monday in the president's home state, where the Biden family has deep roots. President Joe Biden served as a senator there for 36 years, commuting daily to and from Washington, DC.\n\nThe tragic story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that claimed the lives of his wife and baby daughter in the early 1970s is well-known. Beau Biden, who passed away at 46 from cancer, had previously held the position of state attorney general.\n\nSome potential jurors were dismissed due to personal connections with the Biden family; others were excused because their political views about the Bidens could compromise their impartiality. Despite these challenges, it took just one day to assemble the jury of six men and six women, along with four female alternates, who will preside over the case.\n\nOne prospective juror was dismissed after admitting she had formed an unfavourable opinion of Hunter Biden based on media coverage. \"It's not a good one,\" she confessed.\n\nAnother potential juror was excused after acknowledging his awareness of the case and expressing the view that \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nHowever, much of the questioning centred around issues of drug use, addiction and gun ownership. Lawyers aimed to gauge potential jurors' understanding of the case and dismiss those with strong opinions on drug use or firearm regulation - some of whom are constituents of Biden.\n\nThe jury of 12 was selected from approximately 65 individuals, their identities kept confidential. Among them were a woman whose sister had been convicted of credit card fraud and drug offences in Delaware around a decade ago, a man whose father was a victim of a gun-related crime, and a woman married to an ex-law enforcement officer who is also a licensed firearm owner.\n\nIn addition, Hunter Biden is set to face a separate trial in California this September over allegations of failing to pay $1.4 million (\u00a31.09m) in taxes. Both cases were initially intended to be settled through a deal with prosecutors last July, following a lengthy investigation into his business activities.\n\nHowever, Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump nominee, raised questions about some peculiar aspects of the deal. This included a proposed guilty plea for misdemeanour offences to settle the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which would result in the dismissal of the case provided he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nThe lawyers failed to resolve her queries, leading to the collapse of the deal. Subsequently, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed the lead investigator, former US attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August. A month later, Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements kicked off as Garland took the hot seat before the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family. The committee's chairman, a key player in the faltering impeachment inquiry linked to Hunter Biden's business ventures, led the charge.\n\nThe trial in Delaware isn't focused on Hunter Biden's international business dealings, but it's expected to unearth some dark, embarrassing, and distressing memories. The president's supporters are fretting about the emotional toll this trial could have on elder Biden, who has always been deeply concerned about his only surviving son and his battle with addiction.\n\nNow, he must endure the public airing of his son's past missteps while juggling a presidential campaign, lackluster poll figures, and gearing up for a debate with Trump. In a heartfelt statement on Monday, the president expressed his \"boundless love\" for his son, along with \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he declared, stating further that he would refrain from commenting on the ongoing case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady spent her 73rd birthday in court, observing the proceedings silently from the front row behind the defence table alongside Hunter Biden's wife Melissa and sister Ashley. President Biden was mostly at their Wilmington home during the day but left after the court session for a campaign event in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nOn Monday night aboard Air Force One, when White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was questioned about the trial's impact on the president's duties, she firmly stated, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first, and is capable of doing his job,\" Jean-Pierre emphasised, though she did not confirm whether Biden received updates during the day or if he had spoken to his son following the trial. President Biden set off for France on Tuesday evening and will be away for the remainder of the week, with plans for the first lady to join him later.\n\nThe charges against Hunter Biden relate to a time when he has openly admitted to struggling with crack addiction, a problem that escalated after his brother's death from cancer in 2015. During this period, he purchased a firearm and kept it for 11 days in October 2018, falsely claiming on the acquisition form that he was not using drugs.\n\nHunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted, although typically, first-time offenders receive much lighter sentences, and it remains uncertain if the judge will impose a prison term.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk",

The trial could last two weeks.\n\nThe trial has become the focus of the political world on the heels of former President Donald Trump's felony conviction Thursday. Hunter Biden has not played a big role in his father's political life and isn't on the ballot in November.\n\nThe jury was selected Monday with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding. The 12-member jury has six men and six women, with four women alternates.\n\nFollow along with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage for live updates.\n\nWho is Abbe Lowell?\n\nHunter Biden's main lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has a long history of working with Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLowell represented Ivanka Trump while she was a White House aide, chiming in as an ethics adviser. He also defended Jared Kushner when House members questioned his use of WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders.\n\nNow, he is defending Hunter Biden who faces three felony charges related to purchasing a gun in 2018. Biden officially added Lowell to his legal team after a plea deal fell through in July that would have covered tax charges and the gun charges. It was seen at the time as a way to take a more aggressive response to the investigation into him, which have been going on for more than five years.\n\nHe was the chief minority counsel during the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss, who is overseeing the prosecution of Hunter Biden, was appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware by former President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nWeiss investigated Biden for years before reaching a plea agreement for the president's son to admit two tax misdemeanors and enter a pretrial program to potentially erase a drug charge. But U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to rubber stamp because of disputes about whether it would protect Biden from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss as special counsel in August to continue his investigation. Weiss secured indictments on gun charges in Delaware, in the trial that started Monday, and on tax charges in California, with that trial set to begin Sept. 5.\n\nWeiss has been criticized by Republicans as going too soft on Biden by reaching a \"sweetheart deal\" in the plea agreement. Democrats have criticized him for being too hard on Biden by pursuing charges that are rarely enforced.\n\nGarland has defended Weiss as an independent prosecutor following the facts and the law.\n\n--Kinsey Crowley and Bart Jansen\n\nHunter Biden had family's support during jury selection\n\nHunter Biden, the president's son, enjoyed the support of relatives as the jury selected Monday in his trial on federal gun charges.\n\nThe first lady, Jill Biden, sat in the front row on her birthday, paying rapt attention and taking notes. She had helped raise Hunter Biden after his mother was killed in a car crash when he was young. Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and half-sister Ashley Biden also attended.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who remained in Wilmington during the jury selection, issued a statement supporting his son despite the political toll the charges have taken on his reelection bid.\n\n\"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,\" Joe Biden said.\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies in the case that kicked off on Monday.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nWhile every witness in the case isn't set in stone, there have been reports about who's expected to testify at the Delaware trial.\n\nAt least two employees from the gun store at the center of the case are expected to testify at the trial. Millard Greer, a former state police officer who authored the final investigative report on the incident included in court files, is expected to testify.\n\nHallie Biden, who was married to President Joe Biden's other son, the late Beau Biden, is also expected to provide testimony. Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden were in a relationship in 2018, and she told law enforcement officials she found a gun in Hunter Biden's vehicle and threw it away outside of a Delaware store.",

James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said.\n\nHines said \"addiction is depressing\" but that Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the justice department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe first lady, Jill Biden, and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom as opening statements began.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4m in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a years-long investigation into his business dealings.\n\nOpening statements come as the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on 11 July by Judge Juan M.

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\n(Reporting by Tom

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as deceptive and driven by addiction, a man whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney argued that his client did not believe he had a drug problem when he stated in the paperwork that he was not in the throes of addiction. Prosecutors, the attorney said, must prove he knowingly violated the law.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"You will see that he is not guilty,\" attorney Abbe Lowell said in opening statements.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase of the Colt revolver when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe case is dredging up painful memories for the president and his family, and revealing new and highly personal details about their struggles as the 2024 election looms, all while the first lady and Hunter Biden's sister Ashley watch from the front row of the courtroom.\n\nJurors will hear testimony from the president's brother James Biden, who is close with Hunter and helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past. They will also hear how Hallie Biden, the widow of the president's late son, also became addicted to crack during a brief relationship with Hunter. She took the gun from Hunter Biden and tossed it into the garbage at a nearby market, afraid of what he might do with it. The gun was later found by someone collecting cans and eventually turned over to police.\n\nThe president was in Washington as the opening statements were delivered. He announced an immigration order and hosted a picnic for congressional leaders before a scheduled departure for France later in the day. He will be gone the rest of the week. First lady Jill Biden planned to meet him in Europe.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been protective and deeply concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors set the stage for their case by playing for jurors audio excerpts of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" in which Hunter, in his own narration, talks about about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase and his descent into drugs following the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015 from cancer.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines told the jury in his opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict,\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nHis state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.\"\n\nLowell also blamed Hunter's problems with the firearm on Hallie's disposal of it.\n\n\"After he bought the gun, Hunter did nothing with it,\" Lowell said. The gun became a problem only because of what Hallie Biden did.\n\nLowell cautioned the jury that their duty was solemn and reminded them: \"The charges against Hunter are not minor. They are serious.\"\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nGarland on Tuesday faced members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLong reported from Washington.

The second prosecution is on tax charges and is scheduled to go to trial in September in California.\n\nWith the jury now set, opening statements are expected to begin Tuesday followed by the government's first witnesses.\n\nHunter Biden faces three counts in the gun case: two false statements for allegedly lying about his drug use when purchasing a firearm, and one for the unlawful possession of a gun by a drug user or addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial is the latest courtroom drama of this election year to hold potential political implications for the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAlthough Hunter Biden is not running for public office, Republicans have long sought to use his legal troubles and foreign business dealings to try to damage his father politically. The trial provides a fresh opportunity to do so.\n\nIt comes just days after his father's opponent in the 2024 election, former President Donald Trump, was found guilty by a New York jury of falsifying business records of hush money payments made to an adult film star.\n\nIn a statement Monday, President Biden said that while he is the president, he's \"also a dad.\"\n\n\"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us,\" he said.\n\nOutside the federal courthouse in downtown Wilmington, police trucks and vans blocked part of the street in front of the building. Inside the courthouse, U.S. Marshals and Secret Service provided security for the high-profile defendant and first family.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika moved quickly through the jury selection process. Most if not all of the potential jurors knew of the case, but they said they had did not know much beyond the headlines.\n\nSince the case revolves around Hunter Biden's addiction to crack cocaine and alcohol, the potential jurors were asked whether they had friends or family who had struggled with addiction. Many said that they did, including one who had a friend who died from a heroin overdose, and another who had a brother struggling with an addiction to PCP and heroin.\n\nBy late afternoon, the judge and both sides had whittled the jury pool down to 12 jurors -- six men and six women -- and four alternates who will hear the case.\n\nThe gun case is rooted in a difficult period in Hunter Biden's life when he was reeling after the death of his brother, Beau, and was addicted to crack cocaine and alcohol. The trial is expected to dredge up deeply personal episodes for Hunter Biden and the toll is took on the Biden family.\n\nThe case centers on a Colt Cobra revolver Hunter Biden bought at a Wilmington gun store in October 2018. Prosecutors say that Biden lied on a standard background check form when buying the gun by declaring that he was not using or addicted to illegal drugs.\n\nProsecutors say they intend to call around a dozen witnesses, including Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and his brother's widow, Hallie Biden, who was romantically involved with Hunter Biden after Beau's death.\n\nIt was Hallie Biden who found the gun and threw it into a dumpster outside a Wilmington market less than two weeks after Hunter purchased the weapon. The gun was later found by a man collecting recyclables, who alerted law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors also intend to use excerpts from Hunter Biden's memoir, in which he talks about his addiction to crack cocaine. Prosecutors also plan to present Biden's own text messages in which he talks about his drug use.\n\nLess than a year ago, it appeared as though Hunter Biden would avoid trial entirely.\n\nHe had a tentative deal with prosecutors under which he would plead guilty to tax charges and enter into a diversion agreement on the gun offenses that would have allowed him to avoid trial.\n\nBut that deal fell apart at a hearing in front of U.S. district Judge Maryellen Noreika, who expressed concerns about how the deal was structured. Biden's legal team and prosecutors were unable to patch it back together.\n\nWeeks later, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss special counsel, and he later brought the two prosecutions against Biden.\n\nHunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, has tried to get the case dismissed on various grounds, but the judge has denied them all.\n\nHe has said that the gun charges his client faces are rarely, if ever, brought under similar circumstances. He also accuses Weiss of bowing to Republican pressure in bringing both cases against Hunter Biden.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"},

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\n(Reporting by Tom

He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he is being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nSON'S TRIAL Hunter Biden departs from federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, on June 3, 2024. AP PHOTO\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip on Monday in the president's home state of Delaware, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator there, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Hunter Biden and his elder brother Beau were injured in the car accident that killed his first wife Neilia and baby girl Naomi in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died of cancer at age 46.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally; others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it only took a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said: \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as lawyers sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a dad,\" the elder Biden said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila

On Monday, a jury of 12 was seated in the federal courthouse in Wilmington. Biden's relatives, his wife, sister and First Lady Jill Biden, attended.\n\nThe opening statements by Justice Department special counsel David Weiss' team and defense lawyers will be followed by testimony from an FBI agent who investigated the case, prosecutors said as court adjourned Monday.\n\nFollow along with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage for live updates.\n\nHow many children does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\nLess than a year after he was commissioned in 2013, Hunter Biden was administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\n\nOn the presidential debate stage in 2020, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the Navy.\n\n\"Hunter got thrown out of the military,\" Trump said. \"He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\n\nAn administrative discharge is standard procedure after failing a drug test. It is different from a dishonorable discharge which is usually the result of misconduct.\n\nHunter Biden's main lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has a long history of working with Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLowell represented Ivanka Trump while she was a White House aide, chiming in as an ethics adviser. He also defended Jared Kushner when House members questioned his use of WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders.\n\nNow, he is defending Hunter Biden who faces three felony charges related to purchasing a gun in 2018. Biden officially added Lowell to his legal team after a plea deal fell through in July that would have covered tax charges and the gun charges. It was seen at the time as a way to take a more aggressive response to the investigation into him, which have been going on for more than five years.\n\nHe was the chief minority counsel during the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss, who is overseeing the prosecution of Hunter Biden, was appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware by former President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nWeiss investigated Biden for years before reaching a plea agreement for the president's son to admit two tax misdemeanors and enter a pretrial program to potentially erase a drug charge. But U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to rubber stamp because of disputes about whether it would protect Biden from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss as special counsel in August to continue his investigation. Weiss secured indictments on gun charges in Delaware, in the trial that started Monday, and on tax charges in California, with that trial set to begin Sept. 5.\n\nWeiss has been criticized by Republicans as going too soft on Biden by reaching a \"sweetheart deal\" in the plea agreement. Democrats have criticized him for being too hard on Biden by pursuing charges that are rarely enforced.\n\nGarland has defended Weiss as an independent prosecutor following the facts and the law.\n\n--Kinsey Crowley and Bart Jansen\n\nHunter Biden had family's support during jury selection\n\nHunter Biden, the president's son, enjoyed the support of relatives as the jury selected Monday in his trial on federal gun charges.\n\nThe first lady, Jill Biden, sat in the front row on her birthday, paying rapt attention and taking notes. She had helped raise Hunter Biden after his mother was killed in a car crash when he was young. Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and half-sister Ashley Biden also attended.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who remained in Wilmington during the jury selection, issued a statement supporting his son despite the political toll the charges have taken on his reelection bid.\n\n\"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,\" Joe Biden said.\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies in the case that kicked off on Monday.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nWhile every witness in the case isn't set in stone, there have been reports about who's expected to testify at the Delaware trial.\n\nAt least two employees from the gun store at the center of the case are expected to testify at the trial. Millard Greer, a former state police officer who authored the final investigative report on the incident included in court files, is expected to testify.\n\nHallie Biden, who was married to President Joe Biden's other son, the late Beau Biden, is also expected to provide testimony. Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden were in a relationship in 2018, and she told law enforcement officials she found a gun in Hunter Biden's vehicle and threw it away outside of a Delaware store.",

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial while the first lady watched from the courtroom and the president sent a message of support.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Washington and Fatima Hussein aboard Air Force One contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial while the first lady watched from the courtroom and the president sent a message of support.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nHunter Biden did not speak to reporters as he entered court on Tuesday.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial while the first lady watched from the courtroom and the president sent a message of support.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

The trial's jury was seated Monday at a Delaware court.\n\nThe trial is expected to give the president's political rivals ammunition as the Democrat seeks reelection in November. Hunter Biden's trial begins days after Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, became the first current or former president in U.S. history to be convicted of a crime. On May 30, a jury found him guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The former president has repeatedly said the trial was rigged against him and has vowed to appeal his conviction.\n\nAfter the jury in Hunter Biden's trial was confirmed, conservative social media users questioned the inclusion of the fifth juror -- who was qualified with no objections, having previously worked for the Secret Service along with her husband.\n\nOn X, user @Grunt0313 wrote: \"Apparently one of the potential jurors in the Hunter Biden trial works for the Secret Service. What are the statistical odds of that happening organically? Hint; they approach zero.\"\n\nThe Secret Service is a federal law agency whose agents are tasked with protecting current and former political leaders, including the president.\n\nOther social media users complained that first lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's stepmother, was present in the courtroom during jury selection. They also took issue with Ashley Biden, Hunter Biden's sister, reportedly smiling at the former Secret Service agent and with members of the jury saying their friends or family members had histories of substance use.\n\nX user @_johnnymaga, who has more than 90,000 followers on the platform, wrote: \"The Hunter Biden jury has been selected and it's comically rigged, of course.\n\n\"Includes 6 people directly impacted by drug addiction and a former secret service employee who Ashley Biden smiled at.\"\n\nThe post included a clip of Fox News' Jesse Watters discussing the jurors.\n\n\"Another juror worked for the Secret Service. Her husband is still in the Secret Service,\" Watters said. \"Ashley Biden reportedly smiling when she heard that. Oh, and there's an Obama donor as an alternate.\"\n\nUser @KarluskaP, who has more than 134,000 followers on X, also shared the clip, writing: \"The Fix is in! Listen to this jury pool for Hunter -- it sounds like a NA meeting with a Secret Service agent for good measure.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted Hunter Biden's legal team for comment via email.\n\nThe defense has argued that Hunter Biden did not see himself as an addict at the time he purchased the gun in Delaware, having recently been through a rehabilitation program.\n\nThe prosecution is said to be using text messages Hunter Biden sent as evidence in the trial, including one in which he described himself as being an \"addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know.\"\n\nIn his 2021 memoir, Beautiful Things, Hunter Biden also said he was smoking crack cocaine \"24 hours a day every 15 minutes, seven days a week\" around the time he purchased the firearm, despite saying he was not a drug user on a federal form.\n\nThe president is not expected to attend the trial over concerns that his presence could be a distraction. He would also need a Secret Service detail to arrive with him at the Delaware courtroom.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, the president praised his son's \"resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery.\"\n\nHe continued: \"A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.

The prosecution claims Hunter lied on a background check about his drug use to obtain a revolver. The trial highlights issues of drug addiction and legality, with potential implications for the upcoming U.S. election.\n\nThe prosecution laid out its case on Tuesday in the historic criminal trial of Hunter Biden on gun charges, telling jurors that President Joe Biden's son was a drug addict who lied on paperwork to obtain a revolver and that \"no one is above the law.\" Jurors in federal court in Delaware heard opening statements from prosecution and defense lawyers before the first witness, an FBI agent, was called. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell told the jury that evidence presented in the trial will show that Hunter Biden, 54, did not knowingly violate the law.\n\nIt is the first trial of the child of a sitting U.S. president, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding. Donald Trump last week became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. U.S. Justice Department lawyer Derek Hines walked jurors through the events of October 2018, when prosecutors have said Hunter Biden lied on his background check about his drug use while buying the gun.\n\n\"It was illegal because he was user of crack and a drug addict,\" Hines told the jury. \"No one is above the law.\" Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. Neither the prosecution nor the defense directly addressed that issue.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges accusing him of failing to disclose his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and of illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Lowell urged jurors to listen carefully to evidence that would be presented. Lowell said the gun purchase form asked Hunter Biden only if he was currently an addict, not whether he had used in the past, adding that his client had no \"intent to deceive.\"\n\nThe trial at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington is playing out as Trump and his congressional allies continue to accuse the Justice Department of a politicized prosecution of the former president. U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, brought the case against Hunter Biden and was present in the courtroom on Tuesday. Weiss has separately filed federal tax charges against Hunter Biden in California.\n\nThe trial is expected to offer a tour of Hunter Biden's years-long struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. In one text message that Hines said jurors would see, Hunter Biden wrote that he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\" Hines told jurors they would also see photos and bank records that would show that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict when he purchased the gun, which prosecutors must prove to secure a conviction.\n\nHunter Biden told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019. 'FINDING CRACK ANYTIME'\n\nFBI agent Erika Jensen was called as the first prosecution witness on Tuesday to testify about Hunter Biden's texts and writings about his drug use. Hines asked her about Hunter Biden's 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things,\" which documented his addiction. Hines played about 30 minutes of Biden's monotone voice narrating the audiobook version, which included many gratuitous passages about his constant hunt for drugs and what he called his \"superpower - finding crack anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nHines said prosecutors will call as a witness Hunter Biden's former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused him in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes. Hallie Biden, widow of Beau Biden, Hunter's brother who died of cancer in 2015, is also expected to testify. If convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden is not required to testify and it is unclear whether he will take the stand. Donald Trump did not testify in his criminal trial. It is risky for criminal defendants to testify because it opens them to cross-examination from prosecutors. Trump is due to be sentenced on July 11 after being convicted by a jury in state court in New York last Thursday of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden and one accusing him of unlawfully keeping classified national security documents after leaving office in 2021.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

The Bidens' daughter, Ashley Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden and Hollywood lawyer Kevin Morris also are in attendance.\n\nPresident Biden is scheduled to leave this week for France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday.\n\nAfter opening statements, the prosecution's first witness, FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen, is expected to testify. In their trial brief, prosecutors outlined evidence Jensen's testimony will cover, including Hunter Biden's text messages -- some displaying images of controlled substances -- and excerpts from his memoir, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said Monday that the court would try to accommodate a motion by news media to obtain exhibits that are admitted into evidence.\n\nIn addition to Jensen, the prosecution is expected to call Hunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle; a woman Hunter Biden was romantically involved with from 2017-2018; his brother Beau Biden's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom he was romantically involved, and five other witnesses, including FBI and DEA agents.\n\nThe president's son was indicted by a federal grand jury in September after a diversion agreement for a felony gun offense and a plea deal related to misdemeanor tax charges unraveled when Judge Noreika questioned whether the agreement would enable Hunter Biden to avoid potential future charges.\n\nHe now faces three felony charges stemming from his alleged illegal purchase and possession of a firearm in 2018 while he was a drug user. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in Monday, 10 women and six men, on the first day of the trial. Noreika then went over instructions with the panel.\n\nDuring the jury selection process, all but one of the potential jurors knew of the case due to news reports, and many said they had an immediate connection to someone struggling with drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nBy 11:45 a.m., a dozen potential jurors out of 30 were excused for cause, including scheduling conflicts and political views. One person asserted gun ownership was a \"God-given right,\" while another said her opinion of the Bidens was \"not a good one.\"\n\nThe defense struck another potential juror -- who said he is a Fox News viewer -- a former Wilmington police officer and then worked with Jill Biden at the college where she taught. He also said he'd met President Biden at multiple events and donated to a challenger to Beau Biden in his race to be Delaware attorney general. The potential juror also told the judge he believes prosecutors file cases for political reasons, mentioning the criminal case against former President Donald Trump in New York and, when asked if \"political prosecutions\" ever target Democrats, he offered an emphatic \"no\" in response.\n\nOther potential jurors also answered \"yes\" when the judge asked \"are some Department of Justice and law enforcement probes politically motivated?\" Several cited Trump's New York case.\n\nBefore the trial began, Hunter Biden suffered a couple of setbacks: Norieka declined to allow his lawyers to admit into evidence a second version of the firearms purchase form he filled out to buy the gun, and she granted the government's motion to exclude one of the defense's expert witnesses, Dr. Elie Aoun, who was to testify on the nature of Hunter Biden's drug abuse and whether he understood himself to be an addict.\n\nIn the three-count indictment, the president's son is charged with making false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine. Hunter Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver, and it remained in his possession for 11 days before it was discarded in an outdoor receptacle by Hallie Biden, his romantic partner at the time.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have decried the charges and argued they were \"unconstitutional\" and \"unprecedented,\" as well as in violation of the diversion agreement they maintain was still legally binding and valid.\n\nProsecutors are expected to introduce evidence that details Hunter Biden's use of controlled substances leading up to and during the period he purchased the firearm.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys want to call their own expert witnesses on addiction and forensic psychiatry and forensic toxicology.\n\nThe president's son faces up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.\n\nSeparately, he faces nine federal tax charges in the central district of California in a second indictment brought by Weiss' office where federal prosecutors allege Hunter Biden engaged in a \"four-year scheme\" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes. References to the tax charges are not admissible in his gun trial in Delaware. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nBy Tom Hals and Jack Queen\n\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -Hunter Biden's criminal trial on gun charges kicked off on Tuesday with a government lawyer telling jurors that President Joe Biden's son was being prosecuted for lying on a form he filled out to purchase a handgun and was not above the law.\n\nDerek Hines, a Department of Justice lawyer, began his opening arguments by walking jurors through the events of October 2018, when Hunter Biden purchased the gun but allegedly lied on his background check about his drug use.\n\n\"It was illegal because he was user of crack and a drug addict,\" Hines told the jury. \"No one is above the law.\"\n\nHunter Biden, 54, pleaded not guilty to the three felony charges accusing him of failing to disclose his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and of illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\n\"Hunter bought a small handgun. It was never loaded. He never used it. It was thrown out 11 days later by the person he was dating at the time. Just 11 days later,\" Abbe Lowell, Biden's attorney, told jurors. \"For this, three felonies.\"\n\nThe trial at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, gets underway just days after Republican Donald Trump, who is challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nHunter Biden has discussed publicly and in his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things,\" his years-long crack cocaine use and addiction.\n\nHe told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use.\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles.\n\nTrump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; Editing by Scott Malone, Leslie Adler and Nick Zieminski)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Hunter Biden falsely said he was not a drug user, despite being addicted to cocaine at the time. He has since pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.\n\nHunter Biden trial: Opening statements\n\nHunter Biden's defense kicked off Tuesday's court session by making some objections to evidence the prosecution wants to introduce.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika took time to sort the matter out. It's important to note that she has previously mostly ruled in favor of the prosecution.\n\nThe defense objections were to some specific pictures of Hunter Biden, one in which he's shirtless with drug paraphernalia. The judge overruled the objection, saying it was allowed. Another image showed Hunter Biden sleeping shirtless, exposing a back tattoo. where he's sleeping, one in which he's shirtless exposing a back tattoo. The judge ruled the prosecution can use the images because they establish the president's son's location, which is relevant to the prosecutor's case.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers were allowed to examine prosecutors' excerpts from his books and provide additional context. Still, the judge ruled in five instances that the context Hunter Biden's team wanted to add was irrelevant and hearsay. In three instances, she granted the defense team's requests to add their excerpts from his book.\n\nA short break was allowed within the first few minutes because the defense sent some evidentiary exhibits to the prosecution Tuesday morning which the defense will use to cross-examine the FBI special agent -- the prosecution's first witness.\n\nThe 50-minute break was intended for both sides to discuss among themselves to see if they could come to terms on their own without having her rule on it. Attornies from both sides returned to the courtroom after breaka and opening arguments began.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines opened by hammering the point that \"no one is above the law, no matter what your name is.\" Hines mentioned it at least three times in the first few minutes of the prosecution's statement.\n\nHe meticulously walked the jury through the 4473 gun form in which Hunter Biden filled out and allegedly lied on, saying there isn't a system in place to prevent drug users from getting guns other than this \"self-check\" box on the form in which Hines' claimes Hunter Biden violated.\n\nThe prosecutor also described the romantic relationship between Hunter Biden and his dead brother's widow, claiming that he introduced Hallie Biden to crack and influenced her addiction. Hines shared texts between the two in which Hunter Biden told her he was meeting with a dealer behind a local grocery story. Hines also pointed out that in another one of the messages, Hunter Biden claimed he'd gotten high and fallen asleep.\n\nHines then laid out how after 11 days of owning the gun, Hallie Biden had concerns for Hunter Biden. She allegedly took his gun, wrapped it up in his leather pouch (which he used to transport crack) and threw it in an open garbage can behind a grocery store, Hines said.\n\nIt was then discovered by a man who regularly looked through garbage cans for recycables, the prosecution claimed.\n\nHunter Biden was then reportedly angry when he found out Hallie Biden had taken his gun and demanded they to to retreive it but then it had aleady been found, the prosecution continued.\n\nA jury was seated Monday after prospective panelists were questioned about their thoughts on gun rights and drug addiction while the first lady watched from the front row of the courtroom. The jurors -- six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates -- were instructed by Judge Maryellen Noreika not to talk or read about the case.\n\nIt is the first time a sitting president's child has been prosecuted by that same president's Justice Department.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Monday that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nHunter Biden charges\n\nHunter Biden faces three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried a now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nHunter Biden trial begins\n\nThe trial begins nearly one year after Noreika raised concerns about that plea agreement that would have spared Hunter Biden any prison time.\n\nLead prosecutor David Weiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges.\n\nIf Hunter Biden were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders typically do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "cenlanow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WNTZ -

Just 11 days later,\" Abbe Lowell, Biden's attorney, told jurors. \"For this, three felonies.\"\n\nThe trial at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, gets underway just days after Republican Donald Trump, who is challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nHunter Biden has discussed publicly and in his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things,\" his years-long crack cocaine use and addiction.\n\nHe told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use.\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles.\n\nTrump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a \"drug addict\" whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer. They also played for jurors an audio excerpt of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" where he talks about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden, who attended Monday's court session, joined him in the courtroom again as opening statements began.\n\nDefense attorney Abbe Lowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nAnd his state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.''\n\nHe told the jury that prosecutors have to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly violated the law.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to become a criminal defendant.\n\nMultiple veteran Democratic strategists told the Washington Examiner that they don't expect Hunter Biden's legal issues to move the needle come November, nor do they expect Joe Biden to utilize executive authority to save his son if found guilty in either matter.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denied that Joe Biden would pardon Hunter Biden last year during a press briefing, saying that she has been \"very clear\" that the president would not do so.\n\nJoe Biden, White House staff, and campaign officials seek to avoid discussing Hunter Biden's charges, but the president has publicly discussed how difficult it is to watch his son be tried in the court of public opinion, repeatedly defended his innocence, and said he is proud to be Hunter Biden's father.\n\n\"It impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him,\" Joe Biden said during a 2023 interview with MSNBC when asked about his son's legal problems.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden, alongside Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and his sister, Ashley Biden, all attended Monday's proceedings in Wilmington.\n\nThe president did not visit the courthouse alongside his family but released an uncharacteristic statement just after jury selection began on Monday.\n\n\"I am the president, but I am also a Dad,\" Joe Biden wrote in a statement Monday morning. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\"\n\nJust days prior, the president castigated Trump for claiming that his guilty verdict in a New York hush money trial was \"rigged.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself,\" Joe Biden said Friday. \"It's reckless, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict.\"\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss reportedly plans to call a dozen witnesses to testify in the gun trial, including three former partners of the first son: his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, Lunden Roberts, with whom the younger Biden has a daughter, and Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, Beau Biden.\n\nHallie Biden was involved in a romantic relationship with Hunter Biden after Beau Biden's death, and she is believed to be the person who disposed of the firearm at the heart of Hunter Biden's trial.\n\nFurthermore, the prosecution will reportedly submit Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop, itself a lightning rod for controversy during the 2020 election, as evidence. Joe Biden and his allies repeatedly claimed in 2020 that the laptop was misinformation planted by Trump's team to influence the results of that election, but those claims were independently debunked after Joe Biden entered office.\n\nOne Democratic operative familiar with Joe Biden's campaign team told the Washington Examiner that it will be difficult for the president to have his family's dirty laundry reexamined in the public sphere but that it would not shake the elder Biden's commitment to the rule of law.\n\n\"Of course this will be painful. This would be tough for any father, let alone one who has to face questions from reporters every day,\" that person assessed. \"But this isn't new. The media and Republicans have dragged the Biden family through the mud for nearly a decade now, and President Biden is stronger than you want to give him credit for. I expect him to support his son through the process but ultimately respect the verdict.\"\n\nStill, Hunter Biden's own public statements could make things difficult for the president. Like Trump, Hunter Biden has claimed that his prosecution is politically motivated, citing that both Weiss and Judge Maryellen Noreika, who will preside over the gun trial, were appointed by the former president to serve in Delaware.\n\n\"They are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they're trying to destroy a presidency,\" he claimed in a 2023 interview. \"What they're trying to do is they're trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle and so therefore destroying a presidency in that way.\"\n\nCLICK HERE

But before the opening statements, the judge dismissed multiple efforts by Hunter Biden's legal team to prevent certain photos from being presented at the trial.\n\nThe judge ruled that the photos could be shown to the jury as they provide \"circumstantial evidence\" of Biden's drug use. One of the images depicts a nude Hunter Biden, but since it shows him \"from the chest up\" with the lower part redacted, it will be permitted.\n\nHe has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "claire_anderson@express.co.uk", "name": "Claire Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Cohen_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Cohen Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beau Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/198/1200x630/5413310.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623025", "eventUri": "eng-9623025", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender jail time is unlikely.\n\nPresident Biden on Monday said his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of hard-right Republicans, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. No charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republican lawmakers to initiate impeachment proceedings against Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nsms-gw/bjt", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_bambino@ktbs.com", "name": "Andr\u00e9a Bambino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/ktbs.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/f9/bf95bf8e-b6d8-5719-a233-d9d78e9d2979/665dde5e859f6.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C53&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623025", "eventUri": "eng-9623025", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to become a criminal defendant.\n\nMultiple veteran Democratic strategists told the Washington Examiner that they don't expect Hunter Biden's legal issues to move the needle come November, nor do they expect Joe Biden to utilize executive authority to save his son if found guilty in either matter.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denied that Joe Biden would pardon Hunter Biden last year during a press briefing, saying that she has been \"very clear\" that the president would not do so.\n\nJoe Biden, White House staff, and campaign officials seek to avoid discussing Hunter Biden's charges, but the president has publicly discussed how difficult it is to watch his son be tried in the court of public opinion, repeatedly defended his innocence, and said he is proud to be Hunter Biden's father.\n\n\"It impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him,\" Joe Biden said during a 2023 interview with MSNBC when asked about his son's legal problems.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden, alongside Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and his sister, Ashley Biden, all attended Monday's proceedings in Wilmington.\n\nThe president did not visit the courthouse alongside his family but released an uncharacteristic statement just after jury selection began on Monday.\n\n\"I am the president, but I am also a Dad,\" Joe Biden wrote in a statement Monday morning. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\"\n\nJust days prior, the president castigated Trump for claiming that his guilty verdict in a New York hush money trial was \"rigged.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself,\" Joe Biden said Friday. \"It's reckless, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict.\"\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss reportedly plans to call a dozen witnesses to testify in the gun trial, including three former partners of the first son: his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, Lunden Roberts, with whom the younger Biden has a daughter, and Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden's brother, Beau Biden.\n\nHallie Biden was involved in a romantic relationship with Hunter Biden after Beau Biden's death, and she is believed to be the person who disposed of the firearm at the heart of Hunter Biden's trial.\n\nFurthermore, the prosecution will reportedly submit Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop, itself a lightning rod for controversy during the 2020 election, as evidence. Joe Biden and his allies repeatedly claimed in 2020 that the laptop was misinformation planted by Trump's team to influence the results of that election, but those claims were independently debunked after Joe Biden entered office.\n\nOne Democratic operative familiar with Joe Biden's campaign team told the Washington Examiner that it will be difficult for the president to have his family's dirty laundry reexamined in the public sphere but that it would not shake the elder Biden's commitment to the rule of law.\n\n\"Of course this will be painful. This would be tough for any father, let alone one who has to face questions from reporters every day,\" that person assessed. \"But this isn't new. The media and Republicans have dragged the Biden family through the mud for nearly a decade now, and President Biden is stronger than you want to give him credit for. I expect him to support his son through the process but ultimately respect the verdict.\"\n\nStill, Hunter Biden's own public statements could make things difficult for the president. Like Trump, Hunter Biden has claimed that his prosecution is politically motivated, citing that both Weiss and Judge Maryellen Noreika, who will preside over the gun trial, were appointed by the former president to serve in Delaware.\n\n\"They are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they're trying to destroy a presidency,\" he claimed in a 2023 interview. \"What they're trying to do is they're trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle and so therefore destroying a presidency in that way.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDespite the negative connotations, the president has kept his son close in recent weeks.\n\nHunter Biden attended a state dinner for the visiting Kenyan president in May, memorialized the ninth anniversary of his brother, Beau, last week with the rest of the Biden family, and joined his father for a bike ride over the weekend.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Washington and Fatima Hussein aboard Air Force One contributed to this report.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nFollow the

Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of failing to disclose his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and of illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the three felony charges. Hunter Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be criminally tried. The proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic President Joe Biden for the Nov. 5 U.S. election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to center on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" He told U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019. Prosecutors will seek to prove that Hunter Biden knew he was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nU.S. Special Counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Hunter Biden's messages discussing his drug use and Hunter Biden's autobiography, \"Beautiful Things.\" \"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Hunter Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\"\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Hunter Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes. Twelve jurors and four alternates\n\nwere sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Hunter Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nWeiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Hunter Biden with federal tax charges separately in California. The trial comes days after Trump was convicted by a jury in state court in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 U.S. election that put him in the White House.\n\nHunter Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Trump's legal troubles. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021. If convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nNoreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Biden's legal strategy. The judge said Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict.\n\n(This story has not been edited

The son of a sitting president has never before faced a criminal trial.\n\nMORE: As Hunter Biden goes to trial on gun charges, here's how his attorneys plan to defend a 'simple case'\n\nThe trial comes on the heels of former President Donald Trump's conviction on felony charges related to a 2016 hush money payment made to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nLatest Developments\n\nJun 4, 9:31 AM\n\nJudge says they 'lost' a juror overnight\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika took the bench this morning and announced they had \"lost\" one juror overnight after she \"begged\" to be released due to travel difficulties.\n\n\"We lost a juror overnight,\" Judge Noreika said, noting the juror explained she lives far away and does not have a car. Noreika did not specifically address how they would be moving forward, but there are four alternates who were seated yesterday as part of the jury.\n\nOpening statements had still not gotten underway as of 9 a.m., as the court was still awaiting the arrival of four of the jurors.\n\nJudge Noreika used the time to address a number of motions, including rejecting a motion from Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell seeking to exclude from evidence a number of photos of Hunter Biden.\n\nThe government said they needed a photo to prove Hunter Biden was in Malibu at a particular time, and the judge agreed to admit it.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden was back in her same front-row seat as yesterday, seated between Hunter Biden's wife Melissa and Jill Biden's daughter Ashley Biden.\n\nJun 4, 9:02 AM\n\nHunter Biden arrives at courthouse\n\nHunter Biden has arrived at the courthouse for Day 2 of his federal gun trial.\n\nHe was accompanied by wife, Melissa Cohen Biden.\n\nHis stepmother, first lady Jill Biden, and his stepsister Ashley Biden are also in attendance for the second day in a row.\n\nJun 4, 8:52 AM\n\nArguments to get underway this morning\n\nHunter Biden returns to court this morning for the start of arguments in his federal gun trial.\n\nAttorneys with special counsel David Weiss' office and lawyers for Hunter Biden are both scheduled to deliver opening statements in the case.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika yesterday swore in a jury of six men and six women, completing the jury selection process in a single day to put the trial two days ahead of schedule.\n\nJun 3, 7:01 PM\n\nFriends, family look on during Day 1 in court\n\nHunter Biden spent the first day of his gun trial taking notes, reading documents placed in front of him by his attorneys, and often turning to catch a glimpse of the friends and family who came to court to support him.\n\nAt one point, he nodded along as a prospective juror spoke about her friend's overdose after addiction.\n\nJill Biden was seated behind Hunter Biden all day, and she watched attentively as some jurors told the court that they had such a skewed view of her family that they could not be impartial. The first lady did not appear to react in those moments, but at times her daughter Ashley Biden placed her hand on the first lady's back in support.\n\nHunter Biden's family members also appeared to be actively involved with his defense strategy -- at one point standing up and huddling with Hunter Biden's attorneys Abbe Lowell and David Kolansky after a sidebar.\n\nWhen court was dismissed, Jill Biden gave Hunter Biden a hug and a kiss before he walked out hand-in-hand with his wife.\n\nJun 3, 5:51 PM\n\nAfter opening statements, FBI agent will be 1st witness\n\nHunter Biden and his stepmother, first lady Jill Biden, departed court at the conclusion of the day's jury selection proceedings.\n\nWith opening statements set for Tuesday, prosecutors said their first witness would be FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen, who will introduce into evidence several of Hunter Biden's text messages, as well as excerpts from his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and other evidence.\n\nThe parties had carved out three days to select a jury, which means the proceedings are currently running ahead of schedule.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika told jurors they would likely need to be available for the trial through June 14, with the possibility of deliberations stretching into the week of June 17.\n\nJun 3, 5:42 PM\n\nJury of 6 men, 6 woman will hear openings Tuesday\n\nA jury of six men and six women is scheduled to hear opening statements Tuesday in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial.\n\nAn additional four women were chosen as the alternate jurors.\n\nThe jurors include a Secret Service retiree, a man whose father was killed by a gun, and a number of jurors whose family and friends have suffered from addiction -- a central theme in the case against Hunter Biden.\n\nJuror No. 1 is a woman who recently heard about Hunter Biden's case on the evening news. Said said her sister is also an addict, but is \"currently clean.\"\n\nJuror No. 2 is a woman who worked for the Secret Service for nearly 25 years and is now retired. Her husband was a uniformed officer in Washington, D.C.\n\nJuror No. 3 is woman who gets her news from YouTube. When asked what she has heard about the case, she said that it involves guns and drugs.\n\nJuror No. 4 is a woman who said she feels people who smoke weed \"should not be allowed\" to own a gun, but said she could set that aside.\n\nJuror No. 5 is a currently unemployed man who previously received a DUI for which he pleaded guilty.\n\nJuror No. 6 is a man who said he previously knew about the case. He currently owns three pistols and said, \"I believe the Second Amendment is very important.\"\n\nJuror No. 7 is a man whose father owned a firearm. He said he knows \"some\" gun laws.\n\nJuror No. 8 is a man whose father was killed by a gun in 2004. He has a brother who was arrested for drug possession and was sentenced to prison.\n\nJuror No. 9 is a woman whose home was burglarized years ago. She purchased a gun and has had it for over 20 years.\n\nJuror No. 10 is a man whose brother and brother-in-law both suffered from alcoholism and are now both deceased. His niece and nephew both own guns.\n\nJuror No. 11 is a woman whose family hunts and has hunting rifles. She said her \"childhood best friend\" passed away from a drug overdose.\n\nJuror No. 12 is a man whose older brother is an addict who has been to rehab multiple times for PCP and heroin. He said the brother had a gun but he was not sure when.\n\nJun 3, 4:24 PM\n\nJury is seated\n\nThe jury of 12 jurors and 4 alternates has been seated in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial.\n\nThe panel was picked from 250 prospective jurors who arrived at the courthouse this morning for the voir dire process.\n\nJun 3, 1:58 PM\n\nMany prospective jurors know of Hunter Biden's travails\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika has so far quizzed more than 50 Delaware residents about their fitness to serve as jurors in the first trial of a sitting president's son. And being Delaware -- a small state that Joe Biden represented in the Senate for more than three decades -- nearly all of them had some level of familiarity with Hunter Biden's legal travails.\n\n\"I live in Delaware,\" one prospective juror said. \"You can't swing a cat without hearing something.\"\n\n\"Delaware is a small place,\" another said. \"So you hear stuff.\"\n\nSeveral jurors said they had heard or read about this trial specifically. Most had only a cursory understanding of the case, but others expressed a detailed accounting of the charges. A few jurors mentioned the ill-fated plea deal that Hunter Biden initially struck with prosecutors last summer.\n\n\"At one time there was a deal, and then there wasn't,\" one man said.\n\nOne woman had even read Hunter Biden's memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" which prosecutors plan to use to help prove their case. She was excused by the judge.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has emerged repeatedly in questioning, with prospective jurors expressing both positive and negative feelings on his presidency. One woman said she believed that Hunter Biden was facing charges largely because his father is the president.\n\n\"I think it was a very strong factor,\" she said.\n\nSeveral others have been dismissed for harboring negative views toward the Bidens. Asked for his opinion about the president, one man said, \"Not a good one.\" Another man said, \"Negative toward the defendant.\" Both were excused.\n\nThe jury questionnaire also includes several questions about drug and alcohol addiction -- an affliction that many prospective jurors said has personally affected them.\n\nOne woman held back tears as she described how her best friend had died of a heroine overdose. Another man said his daughter is a recovering addict.\n\n\"Everybody needs a second chance,\" he said.\n\nJudge Noreika has been pressing ahead, intent on getting a jury seated as soon as possible -- perhaps even by the end of the day.\n\nIn addition first lady Jill Biden and Hunter Biden's wife Melissa, his sister Ashley Biden attended court during the morning session, and his confidant and financier Kevin Morris is also in attendance.\n\nJun 3, 11:03 AM\n\nPresident Biden says he has 'boundless love' for his son\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement issued this morning that he has \"boundless love\" for his son.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us,\" Biden said in the statement as jury selection got underway.\n\n\"A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" the president said.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" he said. \"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nJun 3, 10:11 AM\n\nJurors face individual questioning as Jill Biden looks on\n\nAfter filling out the jury questionnaire, the first panel of prospective jurors are being brought into the court room one-by-one to face individual questioning from the judge and both parties. As of about 9:45 a.m. ET, the court had made it through the questioning of just six jurors.\n\nThe prospective jurors so far have include a woman who worked with the Secret Service for over two decades and whose husband was a uniformed officer in Washington, D.C., at locations including the White House.\n\nOne prospective juror who volunteered for Hilary Clinton's 2008 campaign prompted the first mention of President Joe Biden -- though not by name.\n\nJudge Norieka asked that prospective juror if her work volunteering and donating to Democratic campaigns would prevent her from being fair in a case that involved \"the son of the Democratic president of the United States.\"\n\nShe said it would not.\n\nThe exchange occurred as first lady Jill Biden sat in the front row of the gallery, watching intently as each juror answered their questions. The first lady is sitting next to Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa.\n\nEarlier, a prospective juror was struck for cause because of his firm views on guns, after he told the judge he thought gun ownership was a \"God-given right.\" He said he would not be able to be impartial in a case where someone was prevented from buying a gun due to federal law.\n\nClick here to read the rest of the blog.",

The trial unfolds in Wilmington, Delaware, scrutinizing Biden's past with drugs and presenting key witnesses. Defense argues the misstep was unintentional. A conviction could lead to a 25-year sentence.\n\nThe prosecution laid out its case on Tuesday in the historic criminal trial of Hunter Biden on gun charges, telling jurors that President Joe Biden's son was a drug addict who lied on paperwork to obtain a revolver and that \"no one is above the law.\" Jurors in federal court in Delaware heard opening statements from prosecution and defense lawyers before the first witness, an FBI agent, was called. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell told the jury that evidence presented in the trial will show that Hunter Biden, 54, did not knowingly violate the law.\n\nIt is the first trial of the child of a sitting U.S. president, with U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding. Donald Trump last week became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. U.S. Justice Department lawyer Derek Hines walked jurors through the events of October 2018, when prosecutors have said Hunter Biden lied on his background check about his drug use while buying the gun.\n\n\"It was illegal because he was user of crack and a drug addict,\" Hines told the jury. \"No one is above the law.\" Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. Neither the prosecution nor the defense directly addressed that issue.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges accusing him of failing to disclose his use of illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra .38-caliber revolver and of illegally possessing the weapon for 11 days in October 2018. Lowell urged jurors to listen carefully to evidence that would be presented. Lowell said the gun purchase form asked Hunter Biden only if he was currently an addict, not whether he had used in the past, adding that his client had no \"intent to deceive.\"\n\nThe trial at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington is playing out as Trump and his congressional allies continue to accuse the Justice Department of a politicized prosecution of the former president. U.S. Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, brought the case against Hunter Biden and was present in the courtroom on Tuesday. Weiss has separately filed federal tax charges against Hunter Biden in California.\n\nThe trial is expected to offer a tour of Hunter Biden's years-long struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. In one text message that Hines said jurors would see, Hunter Biden wrote that he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie.\" Hines told jurors they would also see photos and bank records that would show that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict when he purchased the gun, which prosecutors must prove to secure a conviction.\n\nHunter Biden told Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019. 'FINDING CRACK ANYTIME'\n\nFBI agent Erika Jensen was called as the first prosecution witness on Tuesday to testify about Hunter Biden's texts and writings about his drug use. Hines asked her about Hunter Biden's 2021 autobiography, \"Beautiful Things,\" which documented his addition. Hines played about 30 minutes of Biden's monotone voice narrating the audiobook version, which included many gratuitous passages about his constant hunt for drugs and what he called his \"superpower - finding crack anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nHines said prosecutors will call as a witness Hunter Biden's former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused him in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes. Hallie Biden, widow of Beau Biden, Hunter's brother who died of cancer in 2015, is also expected to testify. If convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nHunter Biden is not required to testify and it is unclear whether he will take the stand. Donald Trump did not testify in his criminal trial. It is risky for criminal defendants to testify because it opens them to cross-examination from prosecutors. Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden and one accusing him of unlawfully keeping classified national security documents after leaving office in 2021.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

Hunter Biden falsely said he was not a drug user, despite being addicted to cocaine at the time. He has since pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.\n\nHunter Biden trial: Opening statements\n\nHunter Biden's defense kicked off Tuesday's court session by making some objections to evidence the prosecution wants to introduce.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika took time to sort the matter out. It's important to note that she has previously mostly ruled in favor of the prosecution.\n\nThe defense objections were to some specific pictures of Hunter Biden, one in which he's shirtless with drug paraphernalia. The judge overruled the objection, saying it was allowed. Another image showed Hunter Biden sleeping shirtless, exposing a back tattoo. where he's sleeping, one in which he's shirtless exposing a back tattoo. The judge ruled the prosecution can use the images because they establish the president's son's location, which is relevant to the prosecutor's case.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers were allowed to examine prosecutors' excerpts from his books and provide additional context. Still, the judge ruled in five instances that the context Hunter Biden's team wanted to add was irrelevant and hearsay. In three instances, she granted the defense team's requests to add their excerpts from his book.\n\nA short break was allowed within the first few minutes because the defense sent some evidentiary exhibits to the prosecution Tuesday morning which the defense will use to cross-examine the FBI special agent -- the prosecution's first witness.\n\nThe break was intended for both sides to discuss among themselves to see if they could come to terms on their own without having her rule on it.\n\nHunter Biden trial: Jury selection\n\nA jury was seated Monday after prospective panelists were questioned about their thoughts on gun rights and drug addiction while the first lady watched from the front row of the courtroom. The jurors -- six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates -- were instructed by Judge Maryellen Noreika not to talk or read about the case.\n\nIt is the first time a sitting president's child has been prosecuted by that same president's Justice Department.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Monday that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nHunter Biden charges\n\nHunter Biden faces three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried a now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nHunter Biden trial begins\n\nThe trial begins nearly one year after Noreika raised concerns about that plea agreement that would have spared Hunter Biden any prison time.\n\nLead prosecutor David Weiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges.\n\nIf Hunter Biden were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders typically do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ -

The first lady did not appear to react in those moments, but at times her daughter Ashley Biden placed her hand on the first lady's back in support.\n\nHunter Biden's family members also appeared to be actively involved with his defense strategy -- at one point standing up and huddling with Hunter Biden's attorneys Abbe Lowell and David Kolansky after a sidebar.\n\nWhen court was dismissed, Jill Biden gave Hunter Biden a hug and a kiss before he walked out hand-in-hand with his wife.\n\nJun 3, 5:51 PM\n\nAfter opening statements, FBI agent will be 1st witness\n\nHunter Biden and his stepmother, first lady Jill Biden, departed court at the conclusion of the day's jury selection proceedings.\n\nWith opening statements set for Tuesday, prosecutors said their first witness would be FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen, who will introduce into evidence several of Hunter Biden's text messages, as well as excerpts from his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and other evidence.\n\nThe parties had carved out three days to select a jury, which means the proceedings are currently running ahead of schedule.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika told jurors they would likely need to be available for the trial through June 14, with the possibility of deliberations stretching into the week of June 17.\n\nJun 3, 5:42 PM\n\nJury of 6 men, 6 woman will hear openings Tuesday\n\nA jury of six men and six women is scheduled to hear opening statements Tuesday in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial.\n\nAn additional four women were chosen as the alternate jurors.\n\nThe jurors include a Secret Service retiree, a man whose father was killed by a gun, and a number of jurors whose family and friends have suffered from addiction -- a central theme in the case against Hunter Biden.\n\nJuror No. 1 is a woman who recently heard about Hunter Biden's case on the evening news. Said said her sister is also an addict, but is \"currently clean.\"\n\nJuror No. 2 is a woman who worked for the Secret Service for nearly 25 years and is now retired. Her husband was a uniformed officer in Washington, D.C.\n\nJuror No. 3 is woman who gets her news from YouTube. When asked what she has heard about the case, she said that it involves guns and drugs.\n\nJuror No. 4 is a woman who said she feels people who smoke weed \"should not be allowed\" to own a gun, but said she could set that aside.\n\nJuror No. 5 is a currently unemployed man who previously received a DUI for which he pleaded guilty.\n\nJuror No. 6 is a man who said he previously knew about the case. He currently owns three pistols and said, \"I believe the Second Amendment is very important.\"\n\nJuror No. 7 is a man whose father owned a firearm. He said he knows \"some\" gun laws.\n\nJuror No. 8 is a man whose father was killed by a gun in 2004. He has a brother who was arrested for drug possession and was sentenced to prison.\n\nJuror No. 9 is a woman whose home was burglarized years ago. She purchased a gun and has had it for over 20 years.\n\nJuror No. 10 is a man whose brother and brother-in-law both suffered from alcoholism and are now both deceased. His niece and nephew both own guns.\n\nJuror No. 11 is a woman whose family hunts and has hunting rifles. She said her \"childhood best friend\" passed away from a drug overdose.\n\nJuror No. 12 is a man whose older brother is an addict who has been to rehab multiple times for PCP and heroin. He said the brother had a gun but he was not sure when.\n\nJun 3, 4:24 PM\n\nJury is seated\n\nThe jury of 12 jurors and 4 alternates has been seated in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial.\n\nThe panel was picked from 250 prospective jurors who arrived at the courthouse this morning for the voir dire process.\n\nJun 3, 1:58 PM\n\nMany prospective jurors know of Hunter Biden's travails\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika has so far quizzed more than 50 Delaware residents about their fitness to serve as jurors in the first trial of a sitting president's son. And being Delaware -- a small state that Joe Biden represented in the Senate for more than three decades -- nearly all of them had some level of familiarity with Hunter Biden's legal travails.\n\n\"I live in Delaware,\" one prospective juror said. \"You can't swing a cat without hearing something.\"\n\n\"Delaware is a small place,\" another said. \"So you hear stuff.\"\n\nSeveral jurors said they had heard or read about this trial specifically. Most had only a cursory understanding of the case, but others expressed a detailed accounting of the charges. A few jurors mentioned the ill-fated plea deal that Hunter Biden initially struck with prosecutors last summer.\n\n\"At one time there was a deal, and then there wasn't,\" one man said.\n\nOne woman had even read Hunter Biden's memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" which prosecutors plan to use to help prove their case. She was excused by the judge.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has emerged repeatedly in questioning, with prospective jurors expressing both positive and negative feelings on his presidency. One woman said she believed that Hunter Biden was facing charges largely because his father is the president.\n\n\"I think it was a very strong factor,\" she said.\n\nSeveral others have been dismissed for harboring negative views toward the Bidens. Asked for his opinion about the president, one man said, \"Not a good one.\" Another man said, \"Negative toward the defendant.\" Both were excused.\n\nThe jury questionnaire also includes several questions about drug and alcohol addiction -- an affliction that many prospective jurors said has personally affected them.\n\nOne woman held back tears as she described how her best friend had died of a heroine overdose. Another man said his daughter is a recovering addict.\n\n\"Everybody needs a second chance,\" he said.\n\nJudge Noreika has been pressing ahead, intent on getting a jury seated as soon as possible -- perhaps even by the end of the day.\n\nIn addition first lady Jill Biden and Hunter Biden's wife Melissa, his sister Ashley Biden attended court during the morning session, and his confidant and financier Kevin Morris is also in attendance.\n\nJun 3, 11:03 AM\n\nPresident Biden says he has 'boundless love' for his son\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement issued this morning that he has \"boundless love\" for his son.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us,\" Biden said in the statement as jury selection got underway.\n\n\"A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" the president said.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" he said. \"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nJun 3, 10:11 AM\n\nJurors face individual questioning as Jill Biden looks on\n\nAfter filling out the jury questionnaire, the first panel of prospective jurors are being brought into the court room one-by-one to face individual questioning from the judge and both parties. As of about 9:45 a.m. ET, the court had made it through the questioning of just six jurors.\n\nThe prospective jurors so far have include a woman who worked with the Secret Service for over two decades and whose husband was a uniformed officer in Washington, D.C., at locations including the White House.\n\nOne prospective juror who volunteered for Hilary Clinton's 2008 campaign prompted the first mention of President Joe Biden -- though not by name.\n\nJudge Norieka asked that prospective juror if her work volunteering and donating to Democratic campaigns would prevent her from being fair in a case that involved \"the son of the Democratic president of the United States.\"\n\nShe said it would not.\n\nThe exchange occurred as first lady Jill Biden sat in the front row of the gallery, watching intently as each juror answered their questions. The first lady is sitting next to Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa.\n\nEarlier, a prospective juror was struck for cause because of his firm views on guns, after he told the judge he thought gun ownership was a \"God-given right.\" He said he would not be able to be impartial in a case where someone was prevented from buying a gun due to federal law.\n\nClick here to read the rest of the blog.",

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a clear drug addict whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors told the jury in their opening statement that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said.\n\n\"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\nHines said \"addiction is depressing\" but that Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom as opening statements began.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Sad-looking rejected dog is now unrecognizable\n\nThe Yale-trained lawyer and lobbyist-turned-artist is charged with falsely stating when buying a .38 caliber revolver in 2018 that he was not using drugs illegally.\n\nHe is also charged with illegal possession of the firearm, which he had for just 11 days in October of that year.\n\nProsecutors are set to introduce often uncomfortable evidence linked to Hunter Biden's years as an addict.\n\nHis defense team had fought to keep a number of images out of evidence but on Tuesday the judge ruled they could be used by prosecutors, CNN reported.\n\nThe president's son, who has written unsparingly about his addiction, will contend that at the moment he bought the revolver he did not consider himself to be an addict. He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender jail time is unlikely.\n\nPresident Biden on Monday said his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of hard-right Republicans, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. No charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republican lawmakers to initiate impeachment proceedings against Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nsms-gw/bjt", "source": {"uri":

In their trial brief, prosecutors outlined evidence Jensen's testimony will cover, including Hunter Biden's text messages -- some displaying images of controlled substances -- and excerpts from his memoir, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said Monday that the court would try to accommodate a motion by news media to obtain exhibits that are admitted into evidence.\n\nIn addition to Jensen, the prosecution is expected to call Hunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle; a woman Hunter Biden was romantically involved with from 2017-2018; his brother Beau Biden's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom he was romantically involved, and five other witnesses, including FBI and DEA agents.\n\nThe president's son was indicted by a federal grand jury in September after a diversion agreement for a felony gun offense and a plea deal related to misdemeanor tax charges unraveled when Judge Noreika questioned whether the agreement would enable Hunter Biden to avoid potential future charges.\n\nHe now faces three felony charges stemming from his alleged illegal purchase and possession of a firearm in 2018 while he was a drug user. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in Monday, 10 women and six men, on the first day of the trial. Noreika then went over instructions with the panel.\n\nDuring the jury selection process, all but one of the potential jurors knew of the case due to news reports, and many said they had an immediate connection to someone struggling with drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nBy 11:45 a.m., a dozen potential jurors out of 30 were excused for cause, including scheduling conflicts and political views. One person asserted gun ownership was a \"God-given right,\" while another said her opinion of the Bidens was \"not a good one.\"\n\nThe defense struck another potential juror -- who said he is a Fox News viewer -- a former Wilmington police officer and then worked with Jill Biden at the college where she taught. He also said he'd met President Biden at multiple events and donated to a challenger to Beau Biden in his race to be Delaware attorney general. The potential juror also told the judge he believes prosecutors file cases for political reasons, mentioning the criminal case against former President Donald Trump in New York and, when asked if \"political prosecutions\" ever target Democrats, he offered an emphatic \"no\" in response.\n\nOther potential jurors also answered \"yes\" when the judge asked \"are some Department of Justice and law enforcement probes politically motivated?\" Several cited Trump's New York case.\n\nBefore the trial began, Hunter Biden suffered a couple of setbacks: Norieka declined to allow his lawyers to admit into evidence a second version of the firearms purchase form he filled out to buy the gun, and she granted the government's motion to exclude one of the defense's expert witnesses, Dr. Elie Aoun, who was to testify on the nature of Hunter Biden's drug abuse and whether he understood himself to be an addict.\n\nIn the three-count indictment, the president's son is charged with making false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine. Hunter Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver, and it remained in his possession for 11 days before it was discarded in an outdoor receptacle by Hallie Biden, his romantic partner at the time.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have decried the charges and argued they were \"unconstitutional\" and \"unprecedented,\" as well as in violation of the diversion agreement they maintain was still legally binding and valid.\n\nProsecutors are expected to introduce evidence that details Hunter Biden's use of controlled substances leading up to and during the period he purchased the firearm.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys want to call their own expert witnesses on addiction and forensic psychiatry and forensic toxicology.\n\nThe president's son faces up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.\n\nSeparately, he faces nine federal tax charges in the central district of California in a second indictment brought by Weiss' office where federal prosecutors allege Hunter Biden engaged in a \"four-year scheme\" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes.

In their trial brief, prosecutors outlined evidence Jensen's testimony will cover, including Hunter Biden's text messages -- some displaying images of controlled substances -- and excerpts from his memoir, \"Beautiful Things.\"\n\nPrevious Story: Hunter Biden's Federal Gun Trial To Begin\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said Monday that the court would try to accommodate a motion by news media to obtain exhibits that are admitted into evidence.\n\nIn addition to Jensen, the prosecution is expected to call Hunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle; a woman Hunter Biden was romantically involved with from 2017-2018; his brother Beau Biden's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom he was romantically involved, and five other witnesses, including FBI and DEA agents.\n\nThe president's son was indicted by a federal grand jury in September after a diversion agreement for a felony gun offense and a plea deal related to misdemeanor tax charges unraveled when Judge Noreika questioned whether the agreement would enable Hunter Biden to avoid potential future charges.\n\nHe now faces three felony charges stemming from his alleged illegal purchase and possession of a firearm in 2018 while he was a drug user. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in Monday, 10 women and six men, on the first day of the trial. Noreika then went over instructions with the panel.\n\nDuring the jury selection process, all but one of the potential jurors knew of the case due to news reports, and many said they had an immediate connection to someone struggling with drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nBy 11:45 a.m., a dozen potential jurors out of 30 were excused for cause, including scheduling conflicts and political views. One person asserted gun ownership was a \"God-given right,\" while another said her opinion of the Bidens was \"not a good one.\"\n\nThe defense struck another potential juror -- who said he is a Fox News viewer -- a former Wilmington police officer and then worked with Jill Biden at the college where she taught. He also said he'd met President Biden at multiple events and donated to a challenger to Beau Biden in his race to be Delaware attorney general. The potential juror also told the judge he believes prosecutors file cases for political reasons, mentioning the criminal case against former President Donald Trump in New York and, when asked if \"political prosecutions\" ever target Democrats, he offered an emphatic \"no\" in response.\n\nOther potential jurors also answered \"yes\" when the judge asked \"are some Department of Justice and law enforcement probes politically motivated?\" Several cited Trump's New York case.\n\nBefore the trial began, Hunter Biden suffered a couple of setbacks: Norieka declined to allow his lawyers to admit into evidence a second version of the firearms purchase form he filled out to buy the gun, and she granted the government's motion to exclude one of the defense's expert witnesses, Dr. Elie Aoun, who was to testify on the nature of Hunter Biden's drug abuse and whether he understood himself to be an addict.\n\nIn the three-count indictment, the president's son is charged with making false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine. Hunter Biden purchased a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver, and it remained in his possession for 11 days before it was discarded in an outdoor receptacle by Hallie Biden, his romantic partner at the time.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys have decried the charges and argued they were \"unconstitutional\" and \"unprecedented,\" as well as in violation of the diversion agreement they maintain was still legally binding and valid.\n\nProsecutors are expected to introduce evidence that details Hunter Biden's use of controlled substances leading up to and during the period he purchased the firearm.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys want to call their own expert witnesses on addiction and forensic psychiatry and forensic toxicology.\n\nThe president's son faces up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.\n\nSeparately, he faces nine federal tax charges in the central district of California in a second indictment brought by Weiss' office where federal prosecutors allege Hunter Biden engaged in a \"four-year scheme\" to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes. References to the tax charges are not admissible in his gun trial in Delaware. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News On 6"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_media@newson6.com", "name": "Griffin Media",

On Monday, a jury of 12 was seated in the federal courthouse in Wilmington. Biden's relatives, his wife, sister and First Lady Jill Biden, attended.\n\nThe opening statements by Justice Department special counsel David Weiss' team and defense lawyers will be followed by testimony from an FBI agent who investigated the case, prosecutors said as court adjourned Monday.\n\nFollow along with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage for live updates.\n\nHow many children does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\n-- Rachel Barber\n\nWhy was Hunter Biden discharged from the Navy?\n\nLess than a year after he was commissioned in 2013, Hunter Biden was administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\n\nOn the presidential debate stage in 2020, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the Navy.\n\n\"Hunter got thrown out of the military,\" Trump said. \"He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\n\nAn administrative discharge is standard procedure after failing a drug test. It is different from a dishonorable discharge which is usually the result of misconduct.\n\n-- Rachel Barber\n\nWho is Abbe Lowell?\n\nHunter Biden's main lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has a long history of working with Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLowell represented Ivanka Trump while she was a White House aide, chiming in as an ethics adviser. He also defended Jared Kushner when House members questioned his use of WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders.\n\nNow, he is defending Hunter Biden who faces three felony charges related to purchasing a gun in 2018. Biden officially added Lowell to his legal team after a plea deal fell through in July that would have covered tax charges and the gun charges. It was seen at the time as a way to take a more aggressive response to the investigation into him, which have been going on for more than five years.\n\nHe was the chief minority counsel during the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.\n\n--Kinsey Crowley\n\nWho is David Weiss?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss, who is overseeing the prosecution of Hunter Biden, was appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware by former President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nWeiss investigated Biden for years before reaching a plea agreement for the president's son to admit two tax misdemeanors and enter a pretrial program to potentially erase a drug charge. But U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to rubber stamp because of disputes about whether it would protect Biden from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss as special counsel in August to continue his investigation. Weiss secured indictments on gun charges in Delaware, in the trial that started Monday, and on tax charges in California, with that trial set to begin Sept. 5.\n\nWeiss has been criticized by Republicans as going too soft on Biden by reaching a \"sweetheart deal\" in the plea agreement. Democrats have criticized him for being too hard on Biden by pursuing charges that are rarely enforced.\n\nGarland has defended Weiss as an independent prosecutor following the facts and the law.\n\n--Kinsey Crowley and Bart Jansen\n\nHunter Biden had family's support during jury selection\n\nHunter Biden, the president's son, enjoyed the support of relatives as the jury selected Monday in his trial on federal gun charges.\n\nThe first lady, Jill Biden, sat in the front row on her birthday, paying rapt attention and taking notes. She had helped raise Hunter Biden after his mother was killed in a car crash when he was young. Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and half-sister Ashley Biden also attended.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who remained in Wilmington during the jury selection, issued a statement supporting his son despite the political toll the charges have taken on his reelection bid.\n\n\"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,\" Joe Biden said.\n\n-Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden being charged with?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies in the case that kicked off on Monday.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\n- Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho's testifying at the Hunter Biden trial?\n\nWhile every witness in the case isn't set in stone, there have been reports about who's expected to testify at the Delaware trial.\n\nAt least two employees from the gun store at the center of the case are expected to testify at the trial. Millard Greer, a former state police officer who authored the final investigative report on the incident included in court files, is expected to testify.\n\nHallie Biden, who was married to President Joe Biden's other son, the late Beau Biden, is also expected to provide testimony. Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden were in a relationship in 2018, and she told law enforcement officials she found a gun in Hunter Biden's vehicle and threw it away outside of a Delaware store.\n\n-

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as deceptive and driven by addiction, a man whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney argued that his client did not believe he had a drug problem when he stated in the paperwork that he was not in the throes of addiction. Prosecutors, the attorney said, must prove he knowingly violated the law.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"You will see that he is not guilty,\" attorney Abbe Lowell said in opening statements.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase of the Colt revolver when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe case is dredging up painful memories for the president and his family, and revealing new and highly personal details about their struggles as the 2024 election looms, all while the first lady and Hunter Biden's sister Ashley watch from the front row of the courtroom.\n\nJurors will hear testimony from the president's brother James Biden, who is close with Hunter and helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past. They will also hear how Hallie Biden, the widow of the president's late son, also became addicted to crack during a brief relationship with Hunter. She took the gun from Hunter Biden and tossed it into the garbage at a nearby market, afraid of what he might do with it. The gun was later found by someone collecting cans and eventually turned over to police.\n\nThe president was in Washington as the opening statements were delivered. He announced an immigration order and hosted a picnic for congressional leaders before a scheduled departure for France later in the day. He will be gone the rest of the week. First lady Jill Biden planned to meet him in Europe.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been protective and deeply concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors set the stage for their case by playing for jurors audio excerpts of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" in which Hunter, in his own narration, talks about about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase and his descent into drugs following the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015 from cancer.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines told the jury in his opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict,\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nLowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nHis state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.\"\n\nLowell also blamed Hunter's problems with the firearm on Hallie's disposal of it.\n\n\"After he bought the gun, Hunter did nothing with it,\" Lowell said. The gun became a problem only because of what Hallie Biden did.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLowell cautioned the jury that their duty was solemn and reminded them: \"The charges against Hunter are not minor. They are serious.\"\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nGarland on Tuesday faced members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Hunter Biden falsely said he was not a drug user, despite being addicted to cocaine at the time. He has since pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.\n\nHunter Biden trial: Jury selection\n\nA jury was seated Monday after prospective panelists were questioned about their thoughts on gun rights and drug addiction while the first lady watched from the front row of the courtroom. The jurors -- six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates -- were instructed by Judge Maryellen Noreika not to talk or read about the case.\n\nIt is the first time a sitting president's child has been prosecuted by that same president's Justice Department.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Monday that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has \"boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nHunter Biden charges\n\nHunter Biden faces three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried a now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nHunter Biden trial begins\n\nThe trial begins nearly one year after U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika raised concerns about that plea agreement that would have spared Hunter Biden any prison time.\n\nLead prosecutor David Weiss has said \"political considerations\" played no part in the investigation. He told lawmakers behind closed doors last year that no one at the Justice Department prevented him from pursuing charges.\n\nIf Hunter Biden were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders typically do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "fox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 8 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.38_Special", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": ".38 Special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun politics in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://fox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/06/GettyImages-2155937450.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623025", "eventUri": "eng-9623025", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

He has discussed them publicly and written about them in his memoir - revelations that will soon act as evidence in his trial and fodder for public consumption.\n\nJoe Biden has previously publicly addressed his son's tumultuous personal life. In the first presidential debate with Donald Trump in 2020, he said he was \"proud\" of his only surviving son.\n\n\"My son, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem,\" he said. \"He's overtaken it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it.\"\n\nFour years ago, President Biden was responding to Trump's attacks on the debate stage. Now, however, his statement could be an attempt to defuse what is shaping up to be a politically fraught moment, where his son's troubled past - and, by extension, that of the entire Biden family - will be on full display.\n\nHunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, is expected to testify about her former husband's drug habit. Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden's brother Beau - with whom Hunter would later be romantically involved and who discarded the handgun in question in a Delaware bin - is also on the prosecution's list of witnesses.\n\n\"It's definitely not a good look,\" says Kate Andersen Brower, who has written several books on US presidents, their families and first ladies. She says presidents have had to deal with family turmoil in the past. Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter faced sibling embarrassments, for instance.\n\nFor a president's child to face a criminal trial is completely unprecedented, however, and it has left the elder Biden walking a tightrope.\n\nHe spent time with his son in Delaware this weekend, and he stayed in Wilmington - where the trial will take place - on Sunday night. During jury selection on Monday, the Biden family was well represented.\n\nBut the president had already returned to Washington by then. While he has noted his support for his son, he is also keeping his distance from the case itself.\n\nBut First Lady Jill Biden attended and sat behind Hunter. The two embraced during a morning break in court proceedings and again after the day concluded. She was joined by Hunter's current wife, Melissa Cohen Biden - who held his hand as he walked out of court - and his half-sister, Ashley Biden, and her husband.\n\nJill Biden married the president after his first wife, Hunter Biden's mother, died in a 1972 car accident in which Hunter and Beau were injured. The accident also took the life of their infant sister, Naomi.\n\nThe president regularly speaks about the closeness of his family - and has made this devotion part of his political identity.\n\nHe talks about how he would take the train home from Washington to Delaware each night as a US senator so he could say goodnight to his children. He wrote a book about dealing with grief following Beau Biden's death from brain cancer in 2016 and has discussed the emotional trauma he experienced in the aftermath of his first wife's passing.\n\nNow, the more tawdry aspects of the Biden family story will be on public display, such as text messages between Hunter Biden and his family - including intimate communication with Beau's widow.\n\nThere will also be photographs and other details of Hunter Biden's crack cocaine use. Some of that was likely gleaned from a laptop computer, whose existence and contents became a controversial part of the final days of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Hunter Biden trial comes on the heels of one of the biggest stories of the 2024 presidential election so far - Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. While the two cases are substantially different - charges against a candidate versus a candidate's son - the rhythm of the two trials will unavoidably lead to comparisons.\n\nAt the very least, the attention focused on the Biden family drama, and Hunter Biden's legal troubles, will shift the media focus from Trump. And the legal issues surrounding his son could make Mr Biden more reluctant to lean in to attacks on Trump's criminal conviction.\n\nIt may also be a significant distraction for the president heading into the last campaign of his political career.\n\n\"It's going to be very difficult on a personal level for Biden,\" Brower says. \"He has experience trying to wall off his personal life from his public life, but it's his only living son. It's got to be very taxing.\"\n\nThere's another way Hunter Biden's legal drama differs from Trump's. The former president's three other criminal cases will probably not happen before November's election.\n\nHunter Biden, however, is also under indictment on federal tax charges, with a trial scheduled for September.\n\nThat case, dealing with an alleged failure to pay at least $1.4m in taxes over four years, might be more politically damaging for the president, given that it involves financial crimes rather than ones connected to his drug addiction.\n\n\"Tax evasion is much harder to make excuses about,\" says Brower.\n\nIf Hunter Biden is convicted in either federal trial, it is within his father's presidential power to pardon him.\n\nSuch a move would have been politically toxic in the past, but Trump exercised his pardon authority for a slew of controversial figures who worked for him and seems to have paid little price for it.\n\nWhile that is an action that Joe Biden the dad might find appealing - he has insisted his son is innocent - the White House has said it is not under consideration.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]",

He has stated that he has been sober since 2019.\n\nIf found guilty, Hunter Biden could face 25 years in prison, although as a first-time offender jail time is unlikely.\n\nPresident Biden on Monday said his son's difficulties would resonate widely.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden has long been the target of hard-right Republicans, and Trump allies have investigated him at length in Congress on allegations of corruption and influence-peddling. No charges have ever been brought.\n\nHunter Biden's business dealings in China and Ukraine have also formed the basis for attempts by Republican lawmakers to initiate impeachment proceedings against Biden. Those efforts too have gone nowhere.\n\nThe White House said last year that there would be no presidential pardon for Hunter Biden in case of a conviction.\n\nsms-gw/bjt\n\nMore from this

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a clear drug addict whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom as opening statements began.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(Scripps News)\n\nOpening statements are set to begin Tuesday morning in the federal firearms case against Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden is the first child of a sitting president to stand trial on criminal charges. This trial comes just days after former President Donald Trump's hush money trial ended in a conviction, making him the first president convicted of a crime.\n\nBiden faces up to 25 years in prison for allegedly lying about his drug addiction when he bought a handgun back in 2018.\n\nThe accusations come from Biden's own book, \"Beautiful Things: A Memoir,\" in which the president's son recounted his drug addiction while also mentioning his purchase of a firearm six years ago. He is being accused of lying on the gun form when he checked a box saying he wasn't addicted to drugs. Prosecutors are expected to use Biden's own words against him.\n\nThe trial, taking place in Wilmington, Delaware, began Monday with jury selection. First lady Jill Biden joined her stepson in support at the courthouse.\n\nA jury of six men and six women was seated on Monday.\n\nMore than 65 potential jurors were questioned and at least 29 were dismissed. The candidates, whose names were not made public, answered questions from Judge Maryellen Noreika about their knowledge of the case so far, their views on gun ownership and their ability to remain impartial.\n\nPolitical Scandals\n\nJury seated in Hunter Biden's gun trial Ava-joye Burnett 7:04 AM, Jun 03, 2024\n\nBiden repeatedly tried to avoid standing trial in this case.\n\nLast year, Biden and prosecutors had been on the brink of finalizing a plea deal, but it unexpectedly fell apart at the last minute when Noreika scrutinized the agreement.\n\nBiden has said the indictment against him is based on politics.\n\n\"I have made mistakes in my life, and wasted opportunities and privileges I was afforded. For that, I am responsible. For that, I am accountable. And for that, I am making amends,\" Biden had said in a news conference.\n\nThe president's son previously pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nOn Monday, President Joe Biden -- who had yet to comment publicly on the trial -- issued a statement in support of his son.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" said President Biden.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,\" he continued.\n\nThe trial could last as long as two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "fox13now.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSTU"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b51777/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F5a%2F6a%2Fb437256f4000aa11cf4f681cbacf%2Fap24155770359307.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623025", "eventUri": "eng-9623025", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2003-06-", "textStart": 1521, "textEnd": 1527}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Lawyers began making opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter in a trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly personal details about his struggle with addiction.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nProsecutors told the jury that Hunter Biden was clearly an addict when he bought the gun, and that he told his brother's widow he was waiting for a drug dealer just days after he lied on the form.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom as openings began.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women, plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nMuch of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case. They dismissed those with strong thoughts on drug use or who might want to tighten regulations on firearms.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Flanked by her daughter Ashley and her daughter-in-law Melissa Cohen Biden, they made a trifecta of support as the highly watched case got underway.\n\nAshley Biden is Hunter's half-sister and Cohen Biden is Hunter's wife. The first lady raised Hunter Biden after the death of the president's first wife in a 1972 car accident. As courtrooms scenes go, the show of presidential family figures in full view of the jury made for an unusual sight.\n\nWearing a purple monochromatic pantsuit, Valentino stilettos and a perfectly coiffed mane, Jill Biden was a powerful presence in the courtroom. As the jury selection process got underway, she could be seen paying rapt attention and taking notes as well as frequently whispering to the women by her side. During breaks, she would wait for Hunter Biden to leave the defense table and give him a hug before exiting the room.\n\nIt was apparent that the first lady's stature was that of any ordinary relative of a defendant. She got up, with everyone else in the courtroom, to \"All rise\" when U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika entered.\n\nBy the afternoon, a diverse jury had been selected. The first lady sat across from everyday Delaware citizens who would soon decide her son's fate.\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of former President Donald Trump's hush money trial and conviction in a New York City courtroom last week. It's a rare moment in history to see so many presidential figures and wannabes packed into courtrooms where their fates and families' fortunes are being decided.\n\nHunter Biden faces three felonies over whether he lied on a federal gun form in 2018 that asked if he was addicted to drugs.\n\nAmong Joe Biden's family who were conspicuously absent Monday were his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and Hallie Biden, his former sister-in-law whom he dated in the aftermath of his brother's death. They are both expected to be called on as witnesses by the prosecution.\n\nFor many, Joe Biden's focus on family is a big part of his image. In 2014, Biden, then vice-president, famously sent a message to his staff, that said, in part: \"If I find out that you are working with me while missing important family responsibilities, it will disappoint me greatly. This has been an unwritten rule since my days in the Senate.\"\n\nHaving lost his first wife and daughter at age 29 has shaped the president and the way he views his commitment to family. In 2015, tragedy struck again when he lost his older son, Beau Biden at age 46 to a brain tumor.\n\nThe president spent Sunday night with the whole family in their Delaware home and was off on a campaign trip to Connecticut Monday afternoon.\n\nStill, for some, the legal spectacles have sown more doubts.\n\nAmong potential jurors at the Biden trial, there were some who said they believed that government and law enforcement \"investigates and prosecutes individuals because of politics.\"\n\nSome pointed to the Trump trial as an example. Still others said they felt Biden was being unfairly targeted because of his father.\n\nAmong supporters at the courtroom was Ricky Mouse, president of the Delaware chapter of the NAACP and a longtime Biden friend.\n\n\"I have known Hunter from when he was about three years old,\" he said. \"He's getting crucified because of his name. And that's wrong. This man have no business in this court whatsoever. And that's the way I see it.\"\n\nBoth Hunter and Jill Biden hugged Mouse when they saw him.\n\n\"Hunter said I took a lot of tension off of him,\" he said afterward.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

Prosecutors said this was evidence that he was using drugs at the time, but Lowell said that, \"in reality, he did not want to see Hallie.\"\n\nAs part of the defense, Lowell also appeared to shift some blame to the owners and employees at the gun store where Hunter Biden purchased the gun, saying they \"wanted to make a sale.\"\n\nLowell claimed that Hunter Biden first purchased a BB gun and a knife at the store, and only purchased the gun after they approached him.\n\n\"Hunter wouldn't have known what a speedloader was,\" said Lowell, who also claimed the salesman never \"took Hunter through\" the form to ensure he understood it.\n\n\"How quickly does a person check through those boxes?\" Lowell asked jurors.\n\nLowell also pushed back on allegations involving the gun pouch that was found with the firearm after Hallie Biden threw the gun it in a dumpster. Prosecutors allege that the pouch had cocaine residue on it, but Lowell said it was never checked for fingerprints and called into question its chain of custody.\n\n\"Hunter has never asked anyone to excuse his mistakes,\" Lowell said, before asking jurors to find him not guilty.\n\nAs Lowell delivered his opening statement, first lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen Biden, and his stepsister Ashley Biden sat largely stoic in the gallery. Hunter Biden kept his eyes on Lowell and his hands clasped. Jurors paid close attention, with several taking notes.\n\nJun 04, 10:51 AM\n\nHunter Biden 'chose to lie,' prosecutor tells jury\n\nGovernment prosecutors told jurors in the trial's opening statements that they should make \"no distinction for Hunter Biden or anybody else\" as they weigh the gun case against the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden \"chose to lie,\" prosecutor Derek Hines said, laying out the case that the defendant purchased a gun while knowing he was an addict and drug user.\n\nHines said Hunter Biden bought the firearm from a gun seller who will testify as a witness that the younger Biden filled out form 4473 -- consenting to a federal background check -- and certified that he understood the form. The prosecution said it will show Hunter Biden \"bought a gun and lied during a background check.\"\n\nThe man who sold Hunter Biden the gun will testify that he watched the defendant fill out the form.\n\nThe gun was then \"taken by someone concerned he had a gun. That person was Halle Biden,\" Hines said, referring to Hunter Biden's romantic partner at the time.\n\nHalle Biden disposed of the gun in a dumpster, where it was retrieved by a man who will also be a witness called by the government.\n\n\"The police were called\" when Halle Biden went to retrieve the gun, Hines said.\n\nHines, in his opening, said evidence will show that \"Hunter Biden knew he was a drug user and a drug addict\" when he filled out the form.\n\nHines cited Hunter Biden's memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" in which he wrote he had a \"superpower of buying crack anywhere, anytime.\"\n\nIn text messages presented by the prosecution, Hunter Biden acknowledged, \"I am an addict.\"\n\nJun 04, 10:09 AM\n\n'No one is above the law,' prosecutor says in opening\n\nOpening statements got underway in Hunter Biden's gun trial after nearly an hour-long delay.\n\nThe jury was seated just before 10 a.m.\n\n\"No one is above the law,\" prosecutor Derek Hines said in his opening statement, addressing the jury from the lectern.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who you are or what your name is,\" Hines told them.\n\nJun 04, 9:29 AM\n\nJudge says they 'lost' a juror overnight\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika took the bench this morning and announced they had \"lost\" one juror overnight after she \"begged\" to be released due to travel difficulties.\n\n\"We lost a juror overnight,\" Judge Noreika said, noting the juror explained she lives far away and does not have a car. Noreika did not specifically address how they would be moving forward, but there are four alternates who were seated yesterday as part of the jury.\n\nOpening statements had still not gotten underway as of 9 a.m., as the court was still awaiting the arrival of four of the jurors.\n\nJudge Noreika used the time to address a number of motions, including rejecting a motion from Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell seeking to exclude from evidence a number of photos of Hunter Biden.\n\nThe government said they needed a photo to prove Biden was in Malibu at a particular time, and the judge agreed to admit it.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden was back in her same front-row seat as yesterday, seated between Hunter Biden's wife Melissa and Jill Biden's daughter Ashley Biden.\n\nJun 04, 8:46 AM\n\nHunter Biden arrives at courthouse\n\nHunter Biden has arrived at the courthouse for Day 2 of his federal gun trial.\n\nHunter Biden returns to court this morning for the start of arguments in his federal gun trial.\n\nAttorneys with special counsel David Weiss' office and lawyers for Hunter Biden are both scheduled to deliver opening statements in the case.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika yesterday swore in a jury of six men and six women, completing the jury selection process in a single day to put the trial two days ahead of schedule.\n\nJun 03, 6:06 PM\n\nFriends, family look on during Day 1 in court\n\nHunter Biden spent the first day of his gun trial taking notes, reading documents placed in front of him by his attorneys, and often turning to catch a glimpse of the friends and family who came to court to support him.\n\nAt one point, he nodded along as a prospective juror spoke about her friend's overdose after addiction.\n\nJill Biden was seated behind Hunter Biden all day, and she watched attentively as some jurors told the court that they had such a skewed view of her family that they could not be impartial. The first lady did not appear to react in those moments, but at times her daughter Ashley Biden placed her hand on the first lady's back in support.\n\nHunter Biden's family members also appeared to be actively involved with his defense strategy -- at one point standing up and huddling with Hunter Biden's attorneys Abbe Lowell and David Kolansky after a sidebar.\n\nWhen court was dismissed, Jill Biden gave Hunter Biden a hug and a kiss before he walked out hand-in-hand with his wife.\n\nJun 03, 5:49 PM\n\nAfter opening statements, FBI agent will be first witness\n\nHunter Biden and his stepmother, first lady Jill Biden, departed court at the conclusion of the day's jury selection proceedings.\n\nWith opening statements set for Tuesday, prosecutors said their first witness would be FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen, who will introduce into evidence several of Hunter Biden's text messages, as well as excerpts from his 2021 memoir, Beautiful Things, and other evidence.\n\nThe parties had carved out three days to select a jury, which means the proceedings are currently running ahead of schedule.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika told jurors they would likely need to be available for the trial through June 14, with the possibility of deliberations stretching into the week of June 17.\n\nJun 03, 5:32 PM\n\nJury of six men, six women will hear openings Tuesday\n\nA jury of six men and six women is scheduled to hear opening statements Tuesday in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial.\n\nAn additional four women were chosen as the alternate jurors.\n\nThe jurors include a Secret Service retiree, a man whose father was killed by a gun, and a number of jurors whose family and friends have suffered from addiction -- a central theme in the case against Hunter Biden.\n\nJuror No. 1 is a woman who recently heard about Hunter Biden's case on the evening news. Said said her sister is also an addict, but is \"currently clean.\"\n\nJuror No. 2 is a woman who worked for the Secret Service for nearly 25 years and is now retired. Her husband was a uniformed officer in Washington, D.C.\n\nJuror No. 3 is woman who gets her news from YouTube. When asked what she has heard about the case, she said that it involves guns and drugs.\n\nJuror No. 4 is a woman who said she feels people who smoke weed \"should not be allowed\" to own a gun, but said she could set that aside.\n\nJuror No. 5 is a currently unemployed man who previously received a DUI for which he pleaded guilty.\n\nJuror No. 6 is a man who said he previously knew about the case. He currently owns three pistols and said, \"I believe the Second Amendment is very important.\"\n\nJuror No. 7 is a man whose father owned a firearm. He said he knows \"some\" gun laws.\n\nJuror No. 8 is a man whose father was killed by a gun in 2004. He has a brother who was arrested for drug possession and was sentenced to prison.\n\nJuror No. 9 is a woman whose home was burglarized years ago. She purchased a gun and has had it for over 20 years.\n\nJuror No. 10 is a man whose brother and brother-in-law both suffered from alcoholism and are now both deceased. His niece and nephew both own guns.\n\nJuror No. 11 is a woman whose family hunts and has hunting rifles. She said her \"childhood best friend\" passed away from a drug overdose.\n\nJuror No. 12 is a man whose older brother is an addict who has been to rehab multiple times for PCP and heroin. He said the brother had a gun but he was not sure when.\n\nJun 03, 4:24 PM\n\nJury is seated\n\nThe jury of 12 jurors and four alternates has been seated in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial.\n\nThe panel was picked from 250 prospective jurors who arrived at the courthouse this morning for the voir dire process.\n\nJun 03, 1:50 PM\n\nMany prospective jurors know of Hunter Biden's travails\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika has so far quizzed more than 50 Delaware residents about their fitness to serve as jurors in the first trial of a sitting president's son. And being Delaware -- a small state that Joe Biden represented in the Senate for more than three decades -- nearly all of them had some level of familiarity with Hunter Biden's legal travails.\n\n\"I live in Delaware,\" one prospective juror said. \"You can't swing a cat without hearing something.\"\n\n\"Delaware is a small place,\" another said. \"So you hear stuff.\"\n\nSeveral jurors said they had heard or read about this trial specifically. Most had only a cursory understanding of the case, but others expressed a detailed accounting of the charges. A few jurors mentioned the ill-fated plea deal that Hunter Biden initially struck with prosecutors last summer.\n\n\"At one time there was a deal, and then there wasn't,\" one man said.\n\nOne woman had even read Hunter Biden's memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" which prosecutors plan to use to help prove their case. She was excused by the judge.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has emerged repeatedly in questioning, with prospective jurors expressing both positive and negative feelings on his presidency. One woman said she believed that Hunter Biden was facing charges largely because his father is the president.\n\n\"I think it was a very strong factor,\" she said.\n\nSeveral others have been dismissed for harboring negative views toward the Bidens. Asked for his opinion about the president, one man said, \"Not a good one.\" Another man said, \"Negative toward the defendant.\" Both were excused.\n\nThe jury questionnaire also includes several questions about drug and alcohol addiction -- an affliction that many prospective jurors said has personally affected them.\n\nOne woman held back tears as she described how her best friend had died of a heroine overdose. Another man said his daughter is a recovering addict.\n\n\"Everybody needs a second chance,\" he said.\n\nJudge Noreika has been pressing ahead, intent on getting a jury seated as soon as possible -- perhaps even by the end of the day.\n\nIn addition first lady Jill Biden and Hunter Biden's wife Melissa, his sister Ashley Biden attended court during the morning session, and his confidant and financier Kevin Morris is also in attendance.\n\nJun 03, 10:26 AM\n\nPresident Biden says he has 'boundless love' for his son\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement issued this morning that he has \"boundless love\" for his son.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us,\" Biden said in the statement as jury selection got underway.\n\n\"A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" the president said.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,\" he said. \"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nJun 03, 10:10 AM\n\nJurors face individual questioning as Jill Biden looks on\n\nAfter filling out the jury questionnaire, the first panel of prospective jurors are being brought into the court room one-by-one to face individual questioning from the judge and both parties. As of about 9:45 a.m. ET, the court had made it through the questioning of just six jurors.\n\nThe prospective jurors so far have include a woman who worked with the Secret Service for over two decades and whose husband was a uniformed officer in Washington, D.C., at locations including the White House.\n\nOne prospective juror who volunteered for Hilary Clinton's 2008 campaign prompted the first mention of President Joe Biden -- though not by name.\n\nJudge Norieka asked that prospective juror if her work volunteering and donating to Democratic campaigns would prevent her from being fair in a case that involved \"the son of the Democratic president of the United States.\"\n\nShe said it would not.\n\nThe exchange occurred as first lady Jill Biden sat in the front row of the gallery, watching intently as each juror answered their questions. The first lady is sitting next to Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa.\n\nEarlier, a prospective juror was struck for cause because of his firm views on guns, after he told the judge he thought gun ownership was a \"God-given right.\" He said he would not be able to be impartial in a case where someone was prevented from buying a gun due to federal law.\n\nJun 03, 9:39 AM\n\n1st batch of 50 jurors sworn in\n\nHunter Biden's arrival through the front entrance of the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building this morning means he would have passed an enormous portrait of his father, which hangs in every federal courthouse in the country.\n\nThe first batch of 50 jurors were sworn in by Judge Noreika, who instructed them not to discuss the case with anyone, including family, or to conduct any research on the case or to read any news about it.\n\nReporters monitoring the proceedings from the overflow room could not hear most of Noreika's statement due to technical difficulties. As technicians tried to fix the issue, they turned on a TV that happened to be playing an attack ad against Joe Biden.\n\nJun 03, 8:58 AM\n\nHunter Biden, first lady Jill Biden arrive at courthouse\n\nHunter Biden has arrived at the courthouse for the start of his federal gun trial this morning.\n\nHis mother, first lady Jill Biden, is also attending.\n\nJun 03, 7:46 AM\n\nProspective jurors will be asked about president\n\nTwo hundred and fifty Delaware residents have been summoned to the courthouse in downtown Wilmington, where they will face typical questions about their fitness to serve as jurors.\n\nBut because this is the trial of the son of a sitting president, there will be some novel topics covered during the jury selection process known as \"voir dire.\"\n\nAmong the questions jurors will be asked: \"If you were eligible to vote in any election(s) in which Joseph R. Biden was a candidate, would that fact prevent you from maintaining an open, impartial mind until all of the evidence is presented, and the instructions of the Court are given?\"\n\nAnd \"Do you believe Robert Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President?\"\n\nJun 03, 7:20 AM\n\nJudge rules annotated form can't be used as evidence\n\nOn the eve of trial, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika threw a wrench in one of the key arguments attorneys for Hunter Biden were planning to advance, ruling that an annotated copy of the federal form Hunter Biden is accused of lying on would be excluded from evidence.\n\nThe original document, called an ATF Form 4473, was created in 2018 when Hunter Biden purchased the firearm. But in 2021, gun store employees made a copy that included some handwritten notes. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell contended that employees had \"tampered with\" the document, and that it raised questions about \"who wrote what on the form, and when.\"\n\nLowell hoped his argument would undermine the credibility of some key government witnesses -- the people who sold Biden the gun -- and potentially create a reasonable doubt that Hunter Biden was the one who actually checked that box.\n\nAttorneys for special counsel David Weiss' office have said the gun shop employees merely \"annotated\" the form and urged Noreika to prevent Lowell from introducing it into evidence.\n\nJury selection is scheduled to get underway today in the federal gun trial of Hunter Biden, who authorities say broke the law when he purchased a Colt revolver in 2018.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's son faces two counts of making false statements while purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining it while addicted to drugs.\n\nAlthough the charges together carry a possible sentence of up to 25 years, legal experts say that, as a first-time and nonviolent offender, Hunter Biden would not likely serve time if convicted.\n\nThe trial, in Delaware federal court, is expected to last two to three weeks.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type":

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a \"drug addict\" whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018 when he said he wasn't in the throes of addiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney said he would call the president's brother James Biden as a witness. James and Hunter are close, and the uncle helped his nephew through rehab stints in the past.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nPeople are also reading...

They also played for jurors an audio excerpt of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" where he talks about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" federal prosecutor Derek Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden, who attended Monday's court session, joined him in the courtroom again as opening statements began.\n\nDefense attorney Abbe Lowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nAnd his state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.''\n\nHe told the jury that prosecutors have to prove that Hunter Biden knowingly violated the law.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the 12-person panel and four alternates.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings are likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was scheduled to travel to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

(AP) -- Lawyers are making opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter in a trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly personal details about his struggle with addiction.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, on Tuesday morning, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Washington and Fatima Hussein aboard Air Force One contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Hunter Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/hunter-biden.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Tuesday painted President Joe Biden's son Hunter as deceptive and driven by addiction, a man whose dark habits ensnared loved ones and who knew what he was doing when he lied on federal forms to purchase a gun in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden's attorney argued that his client did not believe he had a drug problem when he stated in the paperwork that he was not in the throes of addiction. Prosecutors, the attorney said, must prove he knowingly violated the law.\n\n\"You will see that he is not guilty,\" attorney Abbe Lowell said in opening statements.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from the purchase of the Colt revolver when he was, according to his memoir, addicted to crack. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nPeople are also reading...

They will also hear how Hallie Biden, the widow of the president's late son, also became addicted to crack during a brief relationship with Hunter. She took the gun from Hunter Biden and tossed it into the garbage at a nearby market, afraid of what he might do with it. The gun was later found by someone collecting cans and eventually turned over to police.\n\nThe president was in Washington as the opening statements were delivered. He announced an immigration order and hosted a picnic for congressional leaders before a scheduled departure for France later in the day. He will be gone the rest of the week. First lady Jill Biden planned to meet him in Europe.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been protective and deeply concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nProsecutors set the stage for their case by playing for jurors audio excerpts of his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things\" in which Hunter, in his own narration, talks about about going back to Delaware around the time of the gun purchase and his descent into drugs following the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015 from cancer.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines told the jury in his opening statement that Hunter Biden was trying to score drugs just days after he lied on the form, telling his brother's widow in a message that he was waiting for a drug dealer.\n\n\"No one is allowed to lie on a federal form like that, even Hunter Biden,\" Hines said. \"He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied about a federal background check ... the defendant's choice to buy a gun is why we are here.\"\n\n\"When the defendant filled out that form, he knew he was a drug addict,\" and prosecutors don't have to prove he was using that day, Hines said.\n\nHines added: \"Addiction is depressing,\" but Hunter Biden's addiction isn't the reason for the case.\n\nThe proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nLowell said the form asks whether you \"are\" a drug user. \"It does not say 'have you ever been,'\" and he suggested the president's son did not think of himself as someone with a drug problem when he purchased the gun.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis state of mind should be considered at the time of the purchase, not \"what he wrote in a book in 2021.\"\n\nLowell also blamed Hunter's problems with the firearm on Hallie's disposal of it.\n\n\"After he bought the gun, Hunter did nothing with it,\" Lowell said. The gun became a problem only because of what Hallie Biden did.\n\nLowell cautioned the jury that their duty was solemn and reminded them: \"The charges against Hunter are not minor. They are serious.\"\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington.\n\nPeople there are familiar with how Biden's two young sons were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nGarland on Tuesday faced members of the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nIf convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

A footnote asked him to certify that his answers were true and warned him that he was prohibited from purchasing a gun if he answered yes to said question and that making a false statement was a crime. Hunter Biden purchased the revolver. The gun ended up 11 days later in a trash can at a Greenville supermarket, about a 10-minute drive from the gun store. More than five years later, Hunter Biden has ended up in the dock, becoming the first son of a United States president to be tried in a criminal case.\n\nThe trial, which is being held in Wilmington (Delaware), began on Monday with jury selection. There are 12 people (six men and six women), plus four substitutes (all women), who have at their disposal more than 20 pages of instructions on how they should carry out their task. These instructions explain that their deliberations are secret and that they won't have to explain their verdict to anyone. The verdict must be unanimous; all 12 must agree or there will be no verdict.\n\nThese are the keys to the case:\n\nThe president's son is facing three felony counts: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the federal firearms application, and possession of an illegally obtained firearm. Prosecutors maintain that he was a drug user and addict when he bought the gun.\n\nBiden is specifically accused of violating the following provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code: section 922(a)(6), which punishes \"any person in connection with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any firearm or ammunition from a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, knowingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written statement or to furnish or exhibit any false, fictitious, or misrepresented identification, intended or likely to deceive such importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm or ammunition under the provisions of this chapter.\"\n\nThe second charge pertains to section 924(a)(1)(A), which punishes anyone who \"knowingly makes any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records of a person licensed under this chapter or in applying for any license or exemption or relief from disability under the provisions of this chapter.\"\n\nThe third offense involves section 922(g)(3) that makes it illegal to purchase firearms for anyone \"who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.\"\n\nAt the time of the indictment, the court made clear in a document the maximum penalties that Hunter Biden faces. Up to 10 years for the first felony, five for the second and another 10 for the third, along with fines of up to $250,000 for each of them and up to three years of supervised release. But these are maximum penalties. For someone with no criminal record, who has undergone rehabilitation and where the illegal purchase and possession of the weapon was not accompanied by any other violent crime, prison sentences are not common.\n\nAfter the jury selection, the next step is the opening statements, starting with the prosecutor. The prosecution must present evidence of the crimes of which it accuses Hunter Biden. This evidence can be documents or statements from witnesses, whom the defense can also question. Hunter Biden's lawyers can present their own evidence and witnesses, if they wish. At the end of their turn, the prosecution will present their conclusions in their final arguments. The judge will then give instructions to the jury, who will retire to deliberate. Their decision needs to be unanimous.\n\nThe defendant is presumed innocent. The prosecutor needs to prove each and every element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. To achieve a conviction on the two counts related to the purchase of the gun, prosecutors must convince the jury that Hunter Biden knowingly made a false statement on his gun purchase form and that the lie was relevant to the sale. For the weapons possession charge, they must prove that he knew he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance or that he was a drug addict and still knowingly possessed a firearm.\n\nThe prosecution will use excerpts from Hunter Biden's own memoir, Beautiful Things, in which he acknowledges that he was addicted to drugs for four years until March 2019. Prosecutors have also accessed text messages from the defendant sent around that time. \"I was sleeping in a car smoking crack,\" he said in one of them. The Prosecutor's Office is considering calling as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and his brother Beau Biden's widow, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter later had a relationship, to testify about his addiction.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty. However, the judge has made two of his lines of defense difficult. She has prevented an expert from testifying about Hunter Biden's state of denial regarding his addiction when he bought the gun, especially considering that he had undergone an 11-day rehabilitation program. She has also vetoed a version of the form altered by store employees, arguing that this does not change the facts and would introduce confusion. The judge has also rejected the defense's claim that the accused is suffering political persecution.\n\nHunter Biden initially admitted the illegal purchase and possession of the weapon as part of a plea deal with prosecutors to be sentenced with lesser penalties for two tax crimes that were already regularized and to shelve the gun case. Prosecutors initially were ready to waive pursuing the gun purchase in exchange for him staying away from drugs for two years and giving up having a firearm in the future. It is a common agreement in similar cases in which the accused have undergone rehab and have no criminal record. The agreement, however, was derailed just as it was going to be endorsed. Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, rejected it due to the different interpretation of the agreement between the prosecution and the defense and pressure from Republicans.\n\nYes. The crimes of which his son is accused are federal and the president has a broad capacity to pardon them if he were sentenced to jail. So far, Biden has stayed away from the case, but has shown strong support for Hunter as a father. Biden stayed in Wilmington on Monday to support his son. First Lady Jill Biden accompanied him to the courthouse. In a statement, the president said Monday that he has \"unlimited love\" for his son. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\" he said.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with nine alleged tax crimes before California courts. Biden's son has since made his pending payments and the case was going to be closed in accordance with the plea deal that finally derailed.\n\nBoth the charges for the purchase and possession of the gun and the alleged tax crimes concern only Hunter Biden. Republicans have spent years unsuccessfully trying to find links showing that Joe Biden benefited from his son's business dealings, commissions and other irregularities. Their harassment of the president through requests and interrogations of supposed witnesses, and the opening of an investigation for a possible impeachment, has reached a dead end after no evidence was found against President Biden. Much of the accusations centered on the testimony of an FBI informant who said that Joe Biden had collected a $5 million commission from Ukraine. It was later proven that it was all a fabrication by a person with ties to Russian intelligence.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors":

Mr Biden is the first son or daughter of a sitting president to be criminally tried.\n\nThe proceeding at the federal courthouse in the Bidens' hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, comes just days after Republican Donald Trump, the rival to Democratic president Joe Biden for the November 5th US election, became the first former president found guilty of a crime.\n\nThe trial is expected to centre on Hunter Biden's years-long crack cocaine use and addiction, which he has discussed publicly and which was a prominent part of his 2021 autobiography, Beautiful Things. He told US district judge Maryellen Noreika at a hearing last year that he has been sober since the middle of 2019.\n\nProsecutors will seek to prove that Mr Biden was lying when he ticked the box \"no\" next to a question on a federal gun purchase form asking if he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance.\n\nUS special counsel David Weiss is expected to call FBI agent Erika Jensen to testify about Mr Biden's messages discussing his drug use.\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" was one of the messages prosecutors disclosed in a court filing. In another, Mr Biden said he was behind a minor league baseball stadium in Wilmington \"waiting for a dealer named Mookie\".\n\nProsecutors said they may call as a witness his former wife, Kathleen Buhle, who accused Mr Biden in their 2017 divorce proceedings of squandering money on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes.\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in on Monday, many describing their own experiences with family members and friends battling substance abuse. All 12 jurors must agree Mr Biden is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.\n\nMr Weiss, a Trump appointee, has hit Mr Biden with federal tax charges separately in California.\n\nThe trial comes days after Mr Trump was convicted by a jury in New York of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents to cover up \"hush money\" paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels to avoid a sex scandal shortly before the 2016 US election that put him in the White House.\n\nMr Biden's trial gives Republicans a chance to shift attention away from Mr Trump's legal troubles. Mr Trump is due to be sentenced in New York on July 11th. He has pleaded not guilty in three other pending criminal cases, two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in 2020 to Joe Biden and one charging that he unlawfully kept classified national security documents after leaving office in January 2021.\n\nIf convicted on all charges in the Delaware case, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though defendants generally receive shorter sentences, according to the US justice department.\n\nJudge Noreika, also a Trump appointee, entered multiple orders over the weekend that were requested by prosecutors and that appeared to undercut Mr Biden's legal strategy.\n\nThe judge said Mr Biden's legal team could not introduce expert testimony that people suffering from substance abuse disorder might not consider themselves an addict. -

Robert Hunter Biden, it marks another novel moment in a period that has seen no shortage of them: the first time the child of a president faces a felony trial.\n\nComing just four days after jurors in New York convicted former president Donald Trump for falsifying records to hide a hush money payment, Hunter Biden's trial for allegedly lying on a gun-purchase form further entrenches the courtroom as a central player in an unorthodox and chaotic presidential election.\n\nPresident Biden has lost two other children, and the legal ordeal facing his surviving son will be an emotional experience as well, longtime associates say, testing his ability to maintain a professional and political distance. Facing a situation unlike any president before him, Biden - who at 81 is the patriarch of a large and growing family - will have to navigate the trial as president, candidate and father.\n\nThe cases against Trump and Hunter Biden are markedly different, not least because one defendant is seeking the presidency and the other is a private citizen. But both could affect the 2024 election as Republicans seek to tie Biden to his son's legal troubles, and the president's handling of them will be scrutinized closely by voters considering his performance as president and as patriarch.\n\n\"We live in a time when Americans largely consider the courtroom to be politics by other means,\" said Russell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. \"This is the main argument Donald Trump is making, evidently with success, to diminish the impact of his multiple felony convictions. So ironically, this same argument helps inoculate President Biden from damage if his son's trial goes badly.\"\n\nIn one sign of how the two cases could affect each other, Biden on Friday chided Trump for complaining repeatedly that his case was rigged, saying, \"It's reckless, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict.\" Such a comment could make it harder for Biden to criticize his son's trial if he is unhappy with the outcome.\n\nJust as the defendants in the two cases are very different, so are the charges.\n\nIn Trump's case, prosecutors said he used illegal means to prevent public exposure of an affair that could have damaged his political prospects. Hunter, in turn, is charged with falsely declaring that he was not using illegal drugs when he filled out a form to buy a gun in 2018 - even though he was in the throes of a deep drug addiction, as recounted in his memoir.\n\nThe quick succession of two historic cases just five months before the election promises to shape the contours of what is expected to be a close presidential race in unpredictable ways. Hunter Biden faces another criminal trial in September, on tax evasion charges, while Trump faces three more, though they could come after the election.\n\nBiden has largely taken a hands-off approach to the courthouse machinations, seeking to show that he is not interfering with the administration of justice. And his campaign has tried to present a clear distinction between Trump's struggles with the law and Biden's work to deliver for the American people.\n\nBut those efforts could be complicated if Hunter Biden's trial resurfaces a troubled chapter in the family's history. Prosecutors have said they are prepared to call Hunter's former wife Kathleen Buhle, as well as Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter's brother Beau with whom Hunter became romantically involved.\n\nAny tales of drugs and romance that emerge could distract the public from the tawdry facts that came out in Trump's trial, blurring the contrast the president is seeking, said Julian Zelizer, who teaches political history at Princeton University.\n\n\"In terms of the broader impact, it's relevant less for the son being in legal trouble - given that there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by his father - but for how much it distracts from Trump's legal problems and tarnishes Biden's image,\" Zelizer said. \"Should the trial have the effect of dampening the contrast between integrity and wrongdoing, then the impact of the case will be extremely significant.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress for months aggressively pursued Hunter Biden, focusing mostly on his foreign business dealings and trying to tie them to his father, efforts that have largely stalled. GOP leaders continue to charge that the Biden family is ethically troubled, however, and the specter of the president's son facing two criminal trials could play into those efforts.\n\nTrump and his allies complain of a \"two-tiered\" justice system, saying without evidence that the president has used his power to go after his enemies and shield his son, who they say should be facing tougher charges.\n\n\"Just so you understand, this is all done by Biden and his people,\" Trump said Friday. \"This is done by Washington.\" Trump's guilty verdict came in a case brought by state prosecutors in New York, not Biden's Justice Department.\n\nBiden blasted such comments on Friday, saying the jury system is a foundation of American democracy and should not be depicted as fundamentally corrupt. \"The justice system should be respected, and we should never allow anyone to tear it down,\" he said.\n\nBiden's remarks come as his son's lawyers have argued that the prosecutors charging Hunter were influenced by political pressure from Republicans. If Biden were not president, they have said, prosecutors would not be pursuing the charges so aggressively, noting that the two sides were near a plea deal last year but it collapsed after Republicans attacked it. (The deal fell apart under questioning from the judge, when prosecutors and defense lawyers could not agree on whether it blocked the Justice Department from filing more charges against Hunter Biden in the future.)\n\nAgainst that backdrop, White House officials have said they do not plan to respond in real time to developments in Hunter Biden's case, seeing the matter as a personal one that does not directly involve the president. Rather, the White House will seek to showcase Biden's statesmanship on the global stage as he takes presidential trips to France and Italy.\n\nThere will not be a White House war room operation to address the case, for example, or to respond to attacks from Republicans. After the House GOP spent months on an impeachment inquiry focusing on Hunter Biden and the family finances, White House officials said they do not expect the trial to reveal anything new.\n\nLawyers for Hunter Biden did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nYet the trial could exact an emotional toll on a president who speaks to his children and grandchildren almost daily, his associates say. Before running for president, he agonized over the decision in part due to the effect a campaign could have on his family, who had endured years of turbulence marked by Hunter Biden's struggles with addiction in the wake of Beau's 2015 death, according to those close to the Bidens.\n\nAnd Biden is clearly in a unique position as the head of an administration prosecuting his own son. While the president has pledged to allow the legal process to play out, he theoretically could bring it to a sudden end through a pardon, although White House officials say Biden is not considering such a move.\n\nAsked twice last year if there was any possibility that the president would pardon his son, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre gave an emphatic \"No.\"\n\nThe president is expected to spend Monday in Wilmington, Del., where he has a home and where the trial will unfold. On Tuesday evening, Biden travels to France for a five-day trip that will include a speech marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Next week, Biden will head to Italy for a summit of the Group of Seven nations.\n\nHunter Biden's case is expected to take about two weeks, so it could overlap with both presidential trips, putting Biden several time zones away from his son's ordeal.\n\nThe president has kept his son particularly close in recent days, bringing him to a state dinner at the White House and to Delaware, where the Biden family gathered to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Beau Biden. Father and son were spotted cycling together on Saturday in Rehoboth Beach.\n\n\"The president and the first lady, they love their son,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters last week. \"They are proud of how their son has been able to get back on his feet and continue his progress, and they will continue to support him.\"\n\nFew analysts are willing to predict the political impact of Hunter Biden's legal problems - or Trump's - on the 2024 election.\n\nPolling suggests that Trump's guilty verdict could have a marginal impact on voters who are wary of electing a felon. With Hunter Biden's legal troubles a step removed from his father, it's not clear that his trial, or a potential conviction, would sway many voters, according to strategists.\n\nWhile it is unprecedented for a child of a president to face a federal trial, there is a long history of presidential family members who have found themselves in legal trouble, including presidential brothers Billy Carter, Roger Clinton and Neil Bush.\n\nAnd after decades when high-profile prosecutors have targeted everything from President Bill Clinton's Whitewater scandal to the Trump campaign's interactions with Russia, the public has become accustomed to sensitive investigations affecting the presidency, Riley, the presidential historian, said.\n\n\"In the post-Watergate era, independent counsel investigations or their like became a staple of American politics, and in every case the go-to defense for those being investigated was 'This is just partisan politics,'\" Riley said. \"Having heard this over time from both Republican and Democratic presidents, Americans evidently find it not just plausible, but familiar.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Authorities accuse him of lying to the federally licensed gun store by illegally claiming on his application that he was not a drug user at the time and then unlawfully possessing the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe president's son is facing his day in court after his plea deal collapsed, ensuring a trial close to the November election. Mr. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and argues the Justice Department is unfairly targeting him after Republicans labeled his failed plea deal a form of special treatment due to his father's position as president.\n\nCourts are taking center stage in the lead-up to the election, as former President Donald Trump was recently convicted for 34 felonies after jurors handed him a guilty verdict in his Manhattan criminal trial.\n\nDuring jury selection on June 3, several jurors were asked to leave due to their close relationships with the Biden family, which has been entrenched in Delaware for decades. Hunter's deceased brother, Beau, was previously the state attorney general. The judge dismissed other jurors due to their positive or negative political views about the Bidens, preventing their impartiality.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden watched from the courtroom during jury selection as his father, President Biden, issued a message of support from the Oval Office. Jury selection wrapped on the first day after the court found six men and six women, along with four women who are standing by as alternates.\n\nA lot of the jury questioning focused on addiction, gun ownership, and drug use since attorneys looked to dismiss any jurors with strong feelings about drugs or those who might wish to regulate guns, affecting their impartiality.\n\nA total of 65 potential jurors were screened before the court decided on the final 12. The names are not released to the public.\n\nMr. Hunter Biden will also face a September trial in California over his failure to pay $1.4 million in taxes. That case would have also been resolved through a plea deal in July 2023 before it eventually fell apart.\n\nThe president's son is facing up to 25 years in prison if he is convicted in the federal gun case, although first-time offenders like Mr. Hunter Biden typically receive less than the maximum sentences.

Flanked by her daughter Ashley and her daughter-in-law Melissa Cohen Biden, they made a trifecta of support as the highly watched case got underway.\n\nAshley Biden is Hunter's half-sister and Cohen Biden is Hunter's wife. The first lady raised Hunter Biden after the death of the president's first wife in a 1972 car accident. As courtrooms scenes go, the show of presidential family figures in full view of the jury made for an unusual sight.\n\nWearing a purple monochromatic pantsuit, Valentino stilettos and a perfectly coiffed mane, Jill Biden was a powerful presence in the courtroom. As the jury selection process got underway, she could be seen paying rapt attention and taking notes as well as frequently whispering to the women by her side. During breaks, she would wait for Hunter Biden to leave the defense table and give him a hug before exiting the room.\n\nIt was apparent that the first lady's stature was that of any ordinary relative of a defendant. She got up, with everyone else in the courtroom, to \"All rise\" when U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika entered.\n\nBy the afternoon, a diverse jury had been selected. The first lady sat across from everyday Delaware citizens who would soon decide her son's fate.\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of former President Donald Trump's hush money trial and conviction in a New York City courtroom last week. It's a rare moment in history to see so many presidential figures and wannabes packed into courtrooms where their fates and families' fortunes are being decided.\n\nHunter Biden faces three felonies over whether he lied on a federal gun form in 2018 that asked if he was addicted to drugs.\n\nAmong Joe Biden's family who were conspicuously absent Monday were his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and Hallie Biden, his former sister-in-law whom he dated in the aftermath of his brother's death. They are both expected to be called on as witnesses by the prosecution.\n\nFor many, Joe Biden's focus on family is a big part of his image. In 2014, Biden, then vice-president, famously sent a message to his staff, that said, in part: \"If I find out that you are working with me while missing important family responsibilities, it will disappoint me greatly. This has been an unwritten rule since my days in the Senate.\"\n\nHaving lost his first wife and daughter at age 29 has shaped the president and the way he views his commitment to family. In 2015, tragedy struck again when he lost his older son, Beau Biden at age 46 to a brain tumor.\n\nThe president spent Sunday night with the whole family in their Delaware home and was off on a campaign trip to Connecticut Monday afternoon.\n\nStill, for some, the legal spectacles have sown more doubts.\n\nAmong potential jurors at the Biden trial, there were some who said they believed that government and law enforcement \"investigates and prosecutes individuals because of politics.\"\n\nSome pointed to the Trump trial as an example. Still others said they felt Biden was being unfairly targeted because of his father.\n\nAmong supporters at the courtroom was Ricky Mouse, president of the Delaware chapter of the NAACP and a longtime Biden friend.\n\n\"I have known Hunter from when he was about three years old,\" he said. \"He's getting crucified because of his name.

This comes months after he had nine charges brought against him by prosecutor David Weiss, which include failure to pay taxes from 2016 through 2019.\n\nA jury of six men and six women with a wide age range and multiple gun owners was selected on Monday, June 3, 2024.\n\nAhead of the opening statements, expected on Tuesday, in Hunter Biden's gun trial, his sister, Ashley Biden, arrived at the courthouse along with Hunter's friend, Kevin Morris.\n\nHunter Biden is on trial after a four-page indictment accused him of lying when filling out the required paperwork to purchase a Colt Cobra revolver in 2018.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the documents state that when he filled out the required form, he said he was not addicted to or using illegal drugs, however, the indictment claims, \"when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.\"\n\nAfter jury selection on Monday, the 12 individuals, which include a substitute teacher, a former Secret Service employee, and multiple gun owners, were ordered back in court on Tuesday for opening statements.\n\nHunter's gun trial comes six years after cocaine was found in the White House, which is believed to have belonged to the President's son.\n\nAs the court prepares to hear opening statements in Hunter Biden's gun trial, his sister, Ashley Biden, arrived at the courthouse and walked in with Kevin Morris, a close friend of Hunter's, per The Washington Post.\n\nHis wife, Melissa Cohen, also arrived alongside the President's son shortly before.\n\nAfter the proceedings ended on Monday, the 54-year-old was seen hugging and exchanging kisses on the cheek with the First Lady. He then hugged and kissed multiple family members and friends on the cheek, including Kevin Morris.\n\nHe then exited the courtroom with his wife, Melissa Biden, with his hand on her shoulder.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did not appear on Monday and isn't expected to appear on Tuesday for opening statements either. He is scheduled to deliver opening remarks at 6:20 p.m. at the White House congressional picnic.\n\nHunter Biden faces allegations of illegally buying and possessing a firearm while he was abusing or addicted to drugs, which breaches federal law. Hunter has entered a not-guilty plea to the three charges despite being candid about his battles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction.\n\nOn October 12, 2018, the now 54-year-old entered StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington, Delaware, telling the salesman he was interested in purchasing a Colt Cobra revolver, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe store owner claimed he knew the Biden family lived a few miles away and that Joe Biden was not considered a gun rights supporter despite being a sponsor of a federal assault weapons ban that passed in 1994.\n\nAccording to the outlet, the store owner wanted to close the sale as quickly as possible because he did not want the public to know that the President's son was a customer.\n\nIn order to purchase the weapon, Hunter Biden federally required a federal-required form that asked questions such as height, weight, and birth date. According to The Washington Post, he checked boxes declaring he was not a fugitive, had never been convicted of a felony, and had never been committed to a mental institution.\n\nThe form also asked: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\" Hunter marked \"no.\"\n\nAfter running a background check, the 54-year-old bought the gun and several other items, including ammunition and a speed loader, and paid $886.81 in cash, per a receipt.\n\nThis marks the first time in American history that the child of the sitting President is going on trial.\n\nOpening statements in Hunter Biden's trial come just days after former President Donald Trump became the first President to become a convicted criminal after he was found guilty on all 34 charges in his hush-money trial.\n\nAs previously reported by The Blast, the former President of the United States was on trial in relation to a 2016 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_coffey_behrens@theblast.com", "name":

The defense figures the unknowability of Biden's drug-addled intentions may clear him.\n\nJudging from the opening statements in Hunter Biden's federal gun case, it appears as though Ashley Biden's troubling diary may no longer be the heaviest piece of familial baggage President Joe Biden has to lug into the November election.\n\nThe Democratic president and gun control advocate's son faces three counts related to his alleged unlawful possession of a handgun: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on a federal firearms application, and possession of an illegally obtained gun.\n\nIf convicted of all three counts, Biden could land up to 25 years in prison as well as fines up to $750,000. It will also amount to a black eye for the White House, which has made significant hay out in recent days of former President Donald Trump's conviction.\n\nPrior to hearing opening statements from prosecutors and the defense, Trump-appointed Judge Maryellen Noreika of the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware expressed a willingness to permit the jury -- comprising four black men, three black women, two white men, and three white women -- to see images of the president's son in states of undress with illicit drug paraphernalia, reported the New York Times.\n\nAfter it became clear that damning images from the laptop long discounted by the liberal media and intelligence community would come to haunt the Biden family once again, and latecomers were seated, prosecutors and the defense delivered their opening statements to a packed courtroom.\n\nOnce the two framings were established, the prosecution introduced a disembodied witness whose authoritative insights into Hunter Biden's bad choices and debauched lifestyle served to greatly undermine his defense.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines, a senior assistant special counsel, co-opted a statement recycled by Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland and other Democrats when speaking about former President Donald Trump's cases. Hines said that even in this case, \"Nobody is above the law. It doesn't matter who you are, or what your name is.\"\n\n'Nobody is allowed to lie, not even Hunter Biden.'\n\nWhile Hunter Biden dodged the legal consequences everyday Americans alternatively face over their use of illicit substances, Hines made clear he shouldn't be able to skate for lying on a federal gun application.\n\n\"Nobody is allowed to lie, not even Hunter Biden,\" said Hines.\n\nThe prosecutor made clear to jurors, some of whom self-identified during jury selection as having addicts in their respective personal orbits, that the president's son was not in court simply because he was a junkie.\n\n\"Addiction may not be a choice, but lying and buying a gun is a choice,\" said Hines.\n\nNBC News noted the extent to which Hines' emphasized this theme.\n\nHunter Biden \"chose to illegally own a firearm\" and \"chose to lie,\" said the prosecutor. Hines later added that Hunter Biden also did not throw away the gun by choice. Rather, it was taken from him by a former lover, his brother's widow Hallie Biden, who ditched it in a trash can outside of a supermarket.\n\nHines provided the jury and the country with a preview of what to expect.\n\nGordon Cleveland, the man who sold Biden a gun at Starquest Shooters, is expected to testify about Biden's deception. Hallie Biden, granted an immunity agreement, \"will testify about her own crack use\" and potentially her disposal of Hunter Biden's gun. Zoe Kestan, one of Biden's sexual partners also granted immunity, will detail her observations on Biden's nonstop crack use.\n\nThe jury will also hear from Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle; FBI agent Erika Jensen; Delaware State Police Corp. Joshua Marley; Delaware State Police Lt. Millard Greer; forensic chemist Dr. Jason Brewer; and potentially a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration special agent.\n\nExtra to these witnesses, the prosecution will likely introduce textual communications and drug residue to prove Hunter Biden lied, reported the Times.\n\nBiden's defense attorney Abbe Lowell downplayed the severity of Biden's alleged crime; displaced blame, throwing Buhle and Cleveland under the bus; suggested Biden's drug use was not consistent, at least not enough to infer his use at the time of the gun's purchase; and intimated that Biden's drug-addled intentions at the time of purchase are unknowable.\n\n\"Hunter bought a small handgun,\" said Lowell. \"It was never loaded.\"\n\nLowell stressed that Biden never used the Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver.\n\nLowell indicated that it is incumbent upon prosecutors to demonstrate that Biden \"knowingly violated the law.\" To do so, Lowell suggested they will have to show that the president's son entered the gun store with the intention to purchase a weapon while also recognizing himself as an addict. While the prosecution has a witness who will attest to seeing Hunter Biden smoke crack every 15-20 minutes and stop only when it came to sleep, Lowell suggested that intent will be impossible to prove.\n\nNBC News indicated that the defense may also attempt to defuse some of the prosecution's arguments about Hunter Biden's drug use and boozing around the time of the gun purchase by suggesting he routinely deceived Hallie Biden.\n\nFinally, Lowell indicated that the defense will attempt to shift blame onto the gun seller, Cleveland, insinuating that he skirted protocol to make the sale.\n\nAfter a brief recess punctuated by a hysterical outburst by Biden's current wife, Melissa Cohen-Biden -- who called a former Trump White House aide a \"Nazi piece of s***\" -- the trial resumed, and Erika Jensen took the stand.\n\nProsecutors played clips of Hunter Biden reading his memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" wherein he admitted to crack cocaine addiction for a four-year period leading up to a 2019 trip to California.\n\nHunter Biden bought the gun in October 2018. The defense has suggested that contrary to Biden's autobiographical account of the four-year crack binge, he didn't know he was an addict when entering the gun store.\n\nIn one of the passages heard by the court, Hunter Biden mentions his \"superpower\": locating crack wherever he goes.\n\nJensen, an FBI agent of nearly 20 years who was assigned to Hunter Biden's case last year, authenticated ATM receipts, providing some additional context for Hunter Biden's possibly incriminating literary admissions, reported CNN.\n\nPrior to the court breaking for lunch, Hunter Biden did much of the leg work for the prosecution by way of his audio recording, which played to a captive audience, including first lady Jill Biden and Cohen-Biden.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Caleb Boggs Federal Building in Delaware.\n\n\"We lost a juror overnight,\" U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said as she entered the courtroom.\n\nNoreika said the juror, a woman, \"begged\" to be let go of her role, citing transportation issues and adding she did not realize that she had to be at the courthouse every day as a resident of Milford, Del., an hour away south of Wilmington where the courthouse is located.\n\nAmong the 12 jurors picked on Monday, six men and six women, there also were four alternates to fill juror slots for such occasions.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden was seen sitting in the same seat she was in the day before this time with daughter Ashley Biden and Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden.\n\nWhile the court waited for other jurors to arrive and opening arguments to commence, the judge took the time to speak to several motions before her, including one from Hunter Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell, who requested certain photos of Biden be excluded as evidence.\n\nNoreika allowed the photos to be used because they contained \"circumstantial evidence\" of Biden's admitted past with drug use\n\nHunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of possession of a firearm in connection with a 2018 purchase in Delaware of a revolver while he was admittedly using and addicted at the time to drugs.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who you are or what your name is,\" prosecutor Derek Hines said as he began his opening statement Tuesday morning, outlining Hunter Biden's past drug use and how he allegedly lied on a federal form about his addiction while he supposedly attempted to buy the gun in question.\n\nThis comes on the heels of former President Donald Trump's conviction on 34 counts related to falsifying records to facilitate hush-money payments in New York with both trials facing extra scrutiny in the shadow of an election year.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss, an appointee of Trump, brought the charges against the president's son after he was named by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, to investigate the alleged crime last year. Biden's attorneys contended that Weiss \"buckled under political pressure\" after a plea deal crumbled last year.\n\nThe cases mark the first time in American history that an ex-president has ever been criminally convicted in a court of law, and the first time the child of a sitting president was ever put on trial during their father's presidency and all in the middle of a presidential election.\n\nIf convicted on all counts, Hunter Biden could face up 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines, according to court filings. However, because Biden does not have a violent past and is an alleged first-time offender, it is possible he could get a lighter sentence.", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_benson@theolympian.com", "name": "Chris Benson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Caleb_Boggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

(Surrounding New Castle County \"only\" supported Biden with 65% of their vote.) After all, as one prospective juror noted, \"Wilmington is a small place.\" The jury includes a woman who volunteered that she was a donor to Barack Obama but does not include a prospective juror who donated to Donald Trump, a juror who was excused.\n\nInitially, the prospective plea agreement rejected last year by federal Judge Maryellen Noreika would have excused Hunter Biden with a slap on the wrist for these charges, which involve him stating on a federal gun purchase application that he was not addicted to drugs, then having his gun disposed of in a dumpster near a school days later. While Biden is now staring at a prospective 25 years in the clink, it's doubtful he'll serve anywhere near that long if found guilty. (This writer guesses that, if convicted, Hunter will be given probation for some medium length of time, like 18 months to two years.)\n\nRegardless, the six men and six women, plus alternates, will hear a case that seems fairly cut and dried but has the additional attraction of having the freedom of the president's lone surviving son at stake. This has given Joe and Jill Biden the opportunity to play the role of caring, doting parents who aren't actually using Hunter to buy influence. Whether it's bike rides in Rehoboth Beach, invites to state dinners, or commemorating the passing of Hunter's brother Beau last week, the family has been relatively inseparable the past few weeks. \"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" said Joe Biden. \"Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nHowever, according to NBC News, after this initial burst of activity, the Biden family will maintain a radio silence. \"There won't be any rapid-response statements coming from the Wilmington headquarters about developments inside the federal courthouse,\" they claim, adding that the Biden campaign wants to avoid the appearance of impropriety. (Seems a bit late for that.) Helping in that regard is that the trial commences just days before Joe Biden begins a trip to France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day and returns to Europe later this month for another summit before the first presidential debate on June 27, so those items can fill the news cycle. Hunter's trial should be \"old news\" by the time his dad debates Donald Trump, as the proceedings are expected to last two weeks.\n\nEven if Hunter Biden skates on this charge, though, his legal troubles aren't over: He still has a trial scheduled for September in Los Angeles on the more potentially explosive counts of tax evasion, a charge that could bring items like \"ten percent for The Big Guy\" into play just as the election heads into the home stretch. It's more than likely that the Biden defense team will try to push such a trial safely beyond the election, despite the fact its judge, U.S. District Judge Mark C. Scarsi, informed the Biden defense team in that case that there would be no further delays unless a higher court dictates one.\n\nSince it's unlikely any of the remaining Trump trials will be proceeding prior to the election, voters will be able to compare and contrast the New York Trump trial with all its faults to how the justice system treats Hunter Biden. Worth noting, though: Both Judge Noreika and Judge Scarsi are Trump appointees, a distinction sure to be played up by media and Democrats as revenge for Trump's conviction should the younger Biden be found guilty in either case.\n\nAnd we thought we'd have a nice, quiet summer since the presidential field has been set for a while.", "source": {"uri": "patriotpost.us", "dataType": "news", "title":

There are 153 days until the election, and today we're talking guns, drugs and optics -- in the courtroom and at the border.\n\nPresident Biden is expected to make an announcement Tuesday that will curtail the ability of immigrants to claim asylum in the United States.\n\nWe won't know the details until later. But what's being floated is that Border Patrol will count the people who cross illegally each day, and if it exceeds a certain number, likely around 2,500, the U.S. will shut down the whole asylum thing -- even at legal entry spots -- until the number drops below 1,500.\n\nThose numbers are somewhat arbitrary but designed to garner Republican support, because they are far below the number of people crossing daily now.\n\nThere are a ton of problems with this plan, which I am going to dive into Thursday when we have all the details. But for now, here's the takeaway: Donald Trump has successfully weaponized racism to the point that it has become a generally accepted (but false) fact that hordes of brown people are coming in with drugs, guns and the frightening intent to murder, rape and vote.\n\nBecause of that, we are giving up reform in favor of the optics of a closed border.\n\nBut optics matter in campaigns, and Biden has to do something to keep voters from freaking out.\n\nWhich brings us to Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump's historic trial is over (guilty!), but next up at the defense table is Hunter Biden, who has been under federal investigation for about six years. The jury was chosen Monday, and opening statements will likely start Tuesday.\n\nLike Trump, the president's son is charged with lying. For Hunter, it comes down to a \"no\" answer on a federal form -- which translates to three felonies.\n\nHunter bought a Colt Cobra revolver (that's a .38 special) on a lovely Delaware evening in October 2018, a period in which he was either recovering from addiction to alcohol and crack cocaine or still going at it, depending on whom you ask.\n\nAt issue is an answer he provided on a federal form that evening certifying he wasn't using or addicted to illegal drugs. He had recently gotten out of rehab but also really liked crack. And the prosecution says it has evidence indicating he was using in the days around the purchase.\n\nIf convicted, he likely wouldn't serve jail time (but, of course, could).\n\nBut man, this story is messy. And yes, it does involve the infamous laptop.\n\nBasically, Hunter's girlfriend found the gun a few days after he bought it and threw it in the trashcan at a fancy grocery store. And by the way, the girlfriend was Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter's brother Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015 -- a plot point I think they stole from a telenovela.\n\nAnyway, Hunter got super-duper mad and made Hallie go look for the gun. But an old guy who collected cans from the garbage had found it and taken it home.\n\nBut Hallie didn't know that and asked the store manager if she knew anything about the weapon, and police were called. Because that's what you do when the president's daughter-in-law is standing near the vegetable section talking about lost guns.\n\nCops opened a gun-theft case against Hallie because, technically, she had stolen Hunter's gun.\n\nOh, honey. Just put it in the closet next time.\n\nPolice found the trash-picker who had taken the gun home. Hunter declined to press charges against Hallie, and the whole thing seemed to end.\n\nBut then the feds got involved and dug up the form, and here we are. Hallie will likely be a witness, as will Hunter's ex-wife, to whom he was married when he started the affair with Hallie. Pictures and emails from the laptop may make it into evidence as well, and anyway, Marjorie Taylor Greene blasted those sexually explicit photos all over Congress during an oversight hearing last year. 'Cause she's classy.\n\nOf course, all of this is salacious but really Hunter's problem. The right-wing media, however, are using it as evidence of their \"Biden crime family\" conspiracy.\n\nAnd though I in no way think there is a \"Biden crime family conspiracy,\" Hunter is making this really, really hard for democracy and really, really easy for Fox News.\n\nThat's not Hunter's only trial. In September, the prodigal son will be in a Los Angeles federal court on tax evasion charges -- which are more serious and, believe it or not, more salacious.\n\nTurns out Hunter made a lot of money during his crack years but spent it on everything except the IRS. In fact, he failed to file his taxes for a bunch of years -- in 2018, his ex-wife found their 2016 return in the trunk of his car, checks still attached. Crack, it turns out, is not great for your memory.\n\nCourt documents in that case are filled with fun facts like these: Between 2016 and 2019, Hunter spent $683,212 for \"payments -- various women.\" During the same period, he spent $188,960 on \"adult entertainment.\"\n\nAnd of course, you've heard of the slightly shady-sounding international business deals Hunter was involved in, all of which will come up at this trial -- and on the campaign trail. In fact, President Biden and Trump may be debating just as that trial starts.\n\nAnd that makes the tax trial even worse for the president than the gun-and-drugs mess.\n\nBecause while many people addicted to drugs flame out and cause harm to loved ones at some point, Hunter had the means and opportunity to do it spectacularly. Honestly, we are talking endless bad decisions that would be fascinating and comical if they weren't so devastating.\n\nIt's clear Hunter capitalized off the Biden name.\n\nYou can bet that in those final weeks before the election, Trump's team will pound mercilessly on the idea that Joe is corrupt and somehow involved in all of them.\n\nAnd of course, he is -- as a father.\n\n\"I am the president, but I am also a dad,\" Biden said in a statement Monday, adding that he had \"boundless love\" for Hunter. \"A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean.\"\n\nAnd that's where I'll leave it. At least four people sitting on Hunter's jury know someone who has struggled with addiction -- as do most of us. From alcohol to fentanyl, addiction changes everything and everyone it touches.\n\nSo I have a lot of compassion for Hunter and his family.

He emphasized his pride in Hunter's resilience and recovery from addiction, stating, \"Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nJury Selection Process\n\nThe trial began with the selection of jurors. Potential jurors were screened for biases, including their views on gun ownership and drug addiction. One juror was excused for strong Second Amendment views, and another for advocating for stricter gun control laws.\n\nCharges Against Hunter Biden\n\nHunter Biden faces charges stemming from his purchase of a .38 caliber revolver in 2018. He allegedly lied on a federal form by denying illegal drug use. The prosecution argues that Biden knew he had a serious drug addiction at the time of the purchase.\n\nDefense Strategy\n\nThe defense claims Hunter Biden did not perceive himself as a drug addict when he completed the form. They also argue that recent Supreme Court rulings on gun laws could invalidate the charges. The judge has denied the defense's request to call expert witnesses on drug addiction.\n\nTrial Proceedings\n\nJury selection is expected to take several days, followed by opening statements. The trial will examine the details of Hunter Biden's 2018 gun purchase and the constitutional arguments presented by the defense.\n\nKey Issues in the Case\n\nThe case will focus on Hunter Biden's completion of the federal form during the gun purchase. The prosecution alleges that he knowingly lied about his drug use, while the defense contends that he did not see himself as a drug addict at the time.

Later in September, Hunter will face criminal tax fraud and evasion accusations in a California federal court. But back in President Joe Biden's power base of Wilmington, DE, son Hunter is on trial presently for three federal felonies for lying about drugs during a gun purchase.\n\nCriminal defense attorneys seem to have a love-hate relationship with statements about crimes. On the one hand, they wish clients would shut up and not provide police with gift-wrapped cases of incriminating speech. However, many criminal defense attorneys' beach houses can be tied directly back to such statements and the cases that result. Hunter talked himself into these charges, writing about his profligate drug use in his book Beautiful Things. Biden's confessions took on criminal significance beyond possession of dangerous controlled substances when it became clear he bought a gun during a crack binge.\n\nThe federal gun buyer background check asks buyers if they are unlawful users of or addicted to a controlled substance. Hunter checked \"no,\" generating the charge of three crimes: the false statement by checking no, a second false statement regarding making a false statement in a firearms transaction record, and the third barring illegal drug users from possessing firearms. The charges were filed by a Trump appointee to the Justice Department.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, Hunter's jury of 12 was set. Did they get a chance to hear his father's statement on the trial? Probably not. But perhaps before the trial is over, they will. Wilmington-area residents learned that while Joe Biden refuses to comment about a pending criminal case, apparently, that doesn't include references to the defendant in this particular trial.\n\nPresident Biden sent a statement on the trial directly to various media outlets, just as jury selection in Hunter's trial began; the White House did not publish it.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nHunter claimed that he was \"smoking crack every 15 minutes\" around the time of the gun purchase. The trial is expected to last about a week. US District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, is hearing the case.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_d_cosenza@libertynation.com", "name": "Scott D.

(AP) -- Lawyers will make their opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter after a jury was seated for the trial while the first lady watched from the courtroom and the president sent a message of support.\n\nHunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, emerging from an SUV.

Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.\n\nThe trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.\n\nJury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.\n\nPeople just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.\n\nSome prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.\n\nOne potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.\n\n\"It's not a good one,\" she said.\n\nAnother was excused because he was aware of the case and said, \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when.\"\n\nBut much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms -- some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.\n\nThe panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public. They included a woman whose sister was convicted about 10 years ago of credit card fraud and drug charges in Delaware, a man whose father had been killed in a crime involving a gun, and a woman married to a former law enforcement officer who is also a licensed gun owner.\n\nHunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.\n\nBut Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.\n\nOpening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.\n\nThe Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.\n\nThe president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the president said he has \"boundless love\" for his son, \"confidence in him and respect for his strength.\"\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"\n\nThe first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nAboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job,\" said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.\n\nBiden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.\n\nThe case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.\n\nIf convicted, Hunter Biden coud face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.\n\nTrump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

I don't see any good coming from that,\" Graham said, according to HuffPo reporter Igor Bobic who shared the comment in a post to X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBiden, who is being tried in a Delaware court, could face up to 25 years in prison on the trio of federal felony counts. Each also carries a fine of up to $250,000 and three years of supervised release.\n\nOn Monday, jurors were seated with six men and six women being chosen. Opening arguments are set for Tuesday.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" the elder Biden said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,\" Biden added.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden was present in the courtroom to support her husband's eldest son.\n\n\"The best witness against Hunter Biden is Hunter Biden,\" said Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. \"I mean, [he] wrote a book explaining in detail how he was a drug addict at the exact time that he bought a gun and then allegedly lied about it, so he incriminated himself, and it was incredibly foolish to cash in by peddling a book about your addiction when you know you're under criminal investigation for an addiction-related crime.\"\n\nHunter Biden is also facing federal tax evasion charges in California.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

The first order of business was to pick a jury and that happened by day's end.\n\nFrom a pool of 250 prospective jurors, 12 jurors and four alternates were chosen, including a former Secret Service employee. Several of the jurors said they have family members or close friends with histories of substance abuse. One man seated on the jury said he was \"an acquaintance with the first lady\" and he had met Joe Biden at several events.\n\nQuestions posed to the prospective jurors centered around guns and drug abuse. That is the focus of the trial - it is being called Hunter's gun trial. He is accused of lying on the paperwork when he purchased a gun in Delaware.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, is presiding over the trial. She swore in the jurors Monday afternoon. Hunter is on trial for three felony charges. He tried to purchase a firearm in 2018 while allegedly addicted to drugs. Allegedly he checked the box on the paperwork that he was not addicted to drugs. In other words, he is alleged to have falsified paperwork.\n\nHunter pleaded not guilty last September after he was indicted by special counsel David Weiss. This is Hunter's first criminal trial.\n\nHere's the thing - Hunter's parents are trying to sway the jury. Bold opinion? I don't think so. Joe Biden had a hush-hush meeting with Hunter's former girlfriend, the widow of his brother, Beau, last week. Allegedly Demented Joe visited her because the anniversary of Beau's death was coming up. That was the story when he was caught. Never mind that the president has not visited her in previous years. He just happened to when she is scheduled to be a witness in Hunter's trial. She allegedly tossed his handgun in the trash behind a restaurant near a school.\n\nOld Joe is said to be committed to speaking with Hunter each day, perhaps several times a day, as the trial goes forth. First Lady Jill was in the courtroom on Monday. So was his sister, Ashley. Other family members were reported to be there, too.\n\nWhat's the big deal, you say? It was very unusual for Jill to be there for jury selection. She, as first lady, represents the White House. It was inappropriate. The trial won't start until Tuesday. It is not a coincidence that Joe Biden remained in Delaware at his beach mansion on Monday instead of returning to the White House. I think the presence of Joe and Jill was to influence the jury.\n\nIt's like a form of intimidation toward the jury. We're watching you.\n\nJoe Biden posted on X that he is the president but he is also a father.\n\nThe president isn't just another father concerned about his son. Hunter Biden is a 53-year-old man, not a wayward teenager or young man who has never seen the inside of a courtroom. Hunter's wife was with him. Neither of his parents, who live in the White House, should have been anywhere near the courthouse on Monday.\n\nMiranda Devine has the same ideas about Joe and Jilly from Philly hovering around to send a message to any potential opponents of Team Biden. She calls it wise-guy messaging.\n\nJoe Biden's looming presence in the strange small city leaves nobody in any doubt of the message he is sending to Delaware special counsel David Weiss, the prosecutors, the judge, and the jury pool being chosen Monday: You mess with my son, you mess with me.\n\nIt's all very subtle, in a flagrant way, much like Joe's impromptu visit to Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau and former lover of Hunter, just nine days before his son's trial, at which she is the star witness for the prosecution.\n\nDevine went on to write about the frequent sightings of father and son together over the last two weeks. There was a video of a first - Hunter riding a bike behind The Big Guy on Saturday in Rehoboth. Of all the togetherness seen lately, the most notable is Hunter's attendance at the White House state dinner in May for the president of Kenya. Attorney General Merrick Garland was there. It was the second state dinner where both Hunter and Garland were at the same event. Nothing to see here. Just move along.\n\nRemember when Biden campaigned on returning to normal? He was going to bring dignity back to the White House. He lied about it all. Biden is the worst president in my lifetime. The people around him are incompetent.\n\nJoe Biden says he will not talk about Hunter's trial as it is going on. He has in the past, though. He has declared his son's innocence several times in the media.\n\nThe Democrats like to say that no one is above the law.

He is facing federal charges of illegally possessing a firearm after allegedly lying about his status as a drug user when purchasing a gun in 2018. He maintains his innocence and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nWhile the trial has drawn criticism from many conservatives, Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has often criticized the Biden administration, offered a defense of the younger Biden in remarks to The Huffington Post, breaking from some in his own party.\n\n\"I think any average American who's done their taxes like Hunter Biden would have probably faced prosecution. However, I don't think the average American would have been charged with the gun thing. I don't see any good coming from that,\" he told the publication on Monday.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Graham's office and attorney Abbe Lowell, who is representing Biden, for comment via email.\n\nIn California, Biden is also facing a separate case accusing him of not paying $1.4 million in taxes from 2016 to 2019. He has also pleaded not guilty to the federal charges in that case.\n\nProsecutors allege that Biden purchased a gun in 2018 and declared that he was not a drug addict, which would be a felony given his history of drug use. Section 922(g)(3) of the United States Code states it is against the law for anyone who is an \"unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance\" to possess a firearm.\n\nCourt filings submitted by Biden's lawyers in May objected to the special counsel's legal claims defining a user of controlled substances or an addict. The filings also noted that the wording on the form that Biden filled in to purchase the firearm is also in dispute, as it asked in the present tense if he \"is\" a user or addict.\n\n\"Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,\" the filings read.\n\nOn Monday, Joe Biden released a statement praising Hunter as the trial began.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.

Cohen Biden did not comment to NBC about the outburst. (Hunter Biden sued Zielger last year after his website allegedly published hundreds of thousands of leaked emails from Biden's laptop.)\n\n\"For the record, I'm not a Nazi, I'm a believer in the U.S. Constitution.

It doesn't matter who you are, or what your name is,\" Assistant US Attorney Derek Hines said in opening statements. \"We would not be here today if he was just a drug addict.\"\n\nHines revealed that among the prosecution's witnesses who will testify is Hallie Biden, the widow of the president's late son, Beau Biden. He said Hallie will testify about finding the gun, disposing of it, and using drugs with Hunter Biden, with whom he had a relationship after Beau's death.\n\n\"Hallie will testify about her own crack use,\" with Hunter Biden, he added.\n\nDefense attorney Abbe Lowell, however, insisted to jurors that Hunter Biden may not have knowingly broken the law. In his opening statement, Lowell noted Hunter Biden's state of mind in 2018 and that he was in a \"deep state of denial\" about his drug use at the time.\n\n\"Hunter bought a small handgun,\" Lowell said in his opening statement. \"It was never loaded. He never used it.\"\n\n\"They have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter knowingly violated the law,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Cohen_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Cohen Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scorched earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 Democratic National Committee email leak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deep state in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abbe Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beau Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1811,w_3220,x_0,y_21/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1717518734/GettyImages-2155849196_rrhqwn", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623025", "eventUri": "eng-9623025", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Two of the counts accuse him of having completed a form indicating he was not using illegal drugs when he bought a Colt Cobra revolver on Oct. 12, 2018. The third count alleges he possessed a firearm while using a narcotic.\n\nThe indictment said Biden certified on a federally mandated form \"that he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.\"\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\n\nA jury of 12 -- six men and six women -- and four alternates were selected from a pool of over 60 potential jurors Monday. He was joined in court by first lady Jill Biden, who turned 73 on Monday. She sat next to Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, in the audience. It is unclear whether the first lady will return to court Tuesday.\n\nA source familiar with the situation said to expect \"a steady stream of family and friends\" of Biden to attend throughout the trial.\n\nAt least 15 people in the jury pool said they have family members, significant others or close friends with substance abuse issues, including four who were ultimately selected. A source close to the president and the first lady said that they appreciated the many people who have been affected by addiction or substance abuse and have long felt that people understand the complexity of that dynamic and that they saw it on display in court.\n\nWitness testimony will begin after Biden's attorney delivers his opening statement.\n\nProsecutors said their first witness will be FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen. According to a government court filing, Jensen will introduce some of the prosecutors' evidence, including text messages they say show Biden was using crack in the months before and after the gun purchase.\n\nAmong the messages prosecutors plan to introduce is one from the day after the purchase, in which he messaged someone that he was \"waiting for a dealer.\" They also plan to introduce one from Oct. 14, 2018, in which he is alleged to have written, \"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack.\"\n\nJensen will also introduce \"the defendant's admissions in his book/audiobook, as well as introduce other evidence included on the government's exhibit list.\"\n\nProsecutors say they plan to call around 12 witnesses. Among them is Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and Hallie Olivere Biden, the widow of his late brother, Beau.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has said he wants to call the owner of the gun shop as a witness and two to three expert witnesses.

On that form, they are asked whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBiden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nHe was able to purchase the gun and kept it for less than a month before it was thrown by his lover into a trash receptacle outside the upscale Janssen's Market grocery store in Greenville.

A childhood best friend who overdosed on heroin. A nephew who was a scholarship athlete who became addicted to oxycontin after an injury.\n\nAs lawyers for the government and those defending the president's son sought Monday to narrow a field of more than 250 Delawareans to a jury of 12 and four alternates, they heard again and again about the toll that addiction had taken on many who would potentially hear a case that will delve into the darkest chapter of Hunter Biden's own battle with drug use.\n\nOf 65 potential jurors who filed in and out of the federal courtroom to be questioned by Judge Maryellen Noreika, at least 26 indicated that either they, a family member or a close friend had suffered from drug or alcohol abuse, or had been addicted to drugs or alcohol, according to a review of the transcript. Of that group, four were chosen for the final jury, with a fifth serving as an alternate.\n\nOn Tuesday, prosecutors will begin to lay out evidence of their case against Hunter Biden, aiming to prove that he knowingly and illegally purchased a firearm while using illegal drugs, and did not truthfully fill out paperwork, which requires an individual to testify to their sobriety. Legally, his defense team will aim to create doubt among jurors about that evidence and highlight his efforts to repair his life.\n\nPolitically, President Joe Biden's campaign is counting on a majority of Americans to see in Hunter Biden a familiar, if difficult, reminder of struggles in their own lives.\n\nA source close to the president and first lady Jill Biden said they appreciated that so many members of the jury pool referenced addiction or substance abuse in their own families. They have long felt, the source added, that people understand the complexity of the dynamic on display with their son.\n\nAnother source close to the family noted that Hunter Biden had previously encouraged his father to be open about his addiction during the 2020 campaign. This was reflected in comments Biden made during his first debate against Donald Trump when the Republican nominee attacked Hunter Biden. That same theme in 2020 is still just as relevant in 2024, the source added.\n\n\"Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\" Biden said in a written statement issued yesterday as the trial began.\n\nJill Biden, who attended the entire jury selection process, heard one potential juror say he had worked at the same community college in Delaware that the first lady had taught at while explaining that his spouse had problems with addiction.\n\nOne woman selected as an alternate juror said that \"unfortunately, being from the area,\" she knew many people dealing with addiction. \"I feel it's an everyday part of the world these days,\" she said.\n\nMost, but not all, of the jurors who were questioned said their experience with their family members or friends would not prevent them from being fair and impartial in hearing the case.\n\n\"I think it would be easier for me because I went through that with my parents,\" said one potential juror, who was later struck from the pool. \"It is a disease, you know, and I don't look down upon that or feel any judgment because people have problems.\"\n\n\"I think after everybody is recovering, they need a second chance. My daughter has been given a second chance, everybody needs a second chance,\" another potential juror, who also was later struck, told the court.\n\nBut at times, lawyers for the government and Hunter Biden took the opportunity to ask for more specific details to understand how it might influence their thinking.\n\nDerek Hines, the lead prosecutor in the case, asked a woman who worked as a drug counselor if she would hold someone responsible who was an addict. The woman had also indicated she had family and friends dealing with addiction, including two who sought rehabilitation.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\nAbbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's attorney, quickly posed the opposite scenario: \"If the evidence goes to the standard the judge will tell you, you could find somebody not guilty?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered again. She was later dismissed from the pool.\n\nAnother exchange involved a man who said his older brother had been addicted to PCP and heroin. Under questioning, he said his brother also had owned a gun.\n\n\"Do you have any views as to whether someone like your brother, someone who is addicted to drugs, should be able to have a firearm?\" Hines asked.\n\n\"No, they shouldn't,\" the man responded.\n\n\"What about somebody who has had that abuse and then no longer did?\" Lowell asked.\n\n\"Well, I believe that there is room for change,\" the man answered.\n\nHe was ultimately one of the 12 selected to hear the case.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You can't swing a cat without hearing something [about the case],\" one male potential juror told the court Monday.\n\nPresident Biden's son, Hunter Biden, is facing three felony firearm offenses regarding the 2018 purchase of a .38 revolver from a gun shop in the state. Prosecutors are expected to dive into the first son's crack cocaine addiction related to the purchase of the handgun amid the case.\n\nBiden has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN'S DRUG USE: WHAT THE PROSECUTION NEEDS TO PROVE AND WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW\n\nOn Monday, the court heard from more than 60 potential jurors, who appeared before the court individually after filling out a questionnaire related to whether or not they could serve as impartial jurors in the case. By late Monday afternoon, 12 jurors and four alternates were selected from the pool.\n\nThe primary body of jurors is composed of six men and six women.\n\nJury selection lasted the entirety of the day, with the majority of potential jurors telling the court that they have personally experienced addiction issues through their friends and family. Many of the jurors, no matter their racial background, sex or age, responded that they have had a relative who struggled with drug addiction or alcoholism.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN'S CRIMINAL TRIAL ON FEDERAL GUN CHARGES BEGINS WITH JURY SELECTION\n\nPresiding Judge Maryellen Noreika quizzed the jurors one by one about whether their loved ones' addiction issues would weigh on their ability to fairly assess the case.\n\n\"It's the area,\" one young woman told the court after describing that in addition to some of her family members struggling with addiction, she's lost many friends to overdoses.\n\nOthers told the court that their loved ones overcame their addiction issues through stints in rehab, while others lamented that members of their immediate family still suffer from addiction.\n\nProsecutors in the case allege that in October 2018, Biden visited StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply in Wilmington to purchase the Colt revolver but say he lied about his drug addiction when he filled out a form for federal authorities to purchase the gun. Biden's form was ticked \"No\" when asked if he is an unlawful user of a firearm or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nJUDGE BARS PROSECUTORS FROM USING SOME SALACIOUS EVIDENCE IN HUNTER BIDEN'S GUN TRIAL\n\nHe is facing charges of false statement in purchase of a firearm; false statement related to information required to be kept by federal firearms licensed dealer; possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nThe total maximum prison time for the charges could be up to 25 years. Each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.\n\nHunter Biden was joined by first lady Jill Biden as well as his wife, Melissa Cohen, and his sister, Ashley Biden.\n\nJill Biden showed little emotion throughout court proceedings, smiling and engaging only while speaking to family members, such as daughter-in-law Melissa, or other allies who joined her in court. The first lady rarely took glances at the media or potential jurors when they were collectively brought into the court.\n\nAMERICANS GUILTY OF CHARGES SIMILAR TO HUNTER NEVER GOT 'SWEETHEART' DEAL TO KEEP THEM FROM PRISON: CRITICS\n\nHunter Biden, meanwhile, was seen engaging with his defense team throughout the day, flipping through legal papers and chatting with attorney Abbe Lowell. During court breaks, Hunter Biden hugged and kissed Jill Biden and held his wife's hand while leaving court.\n\nIn addition to many jurors telling the court how addiction has impacted their personal lives, others detailed that they have family members or loved ones who own firearms. A handful of jurors told the court they are legal concealed carry holders for self-defense purposes, while others said they disagree with current gun laws and hope to see stricter gun legislation against so-called \"assault weapons.\"\n\nHUNTER BIDEN CRIMINAL TAX CASE ASSIGNED TO TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGE IN DELAWARE\n\nNoreika peppered the potential jurors with questions regarding whether their views on gun laws would influence them fairly assessing the case. Those who said they could not act impartially were excused from the pool.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN SCHEDULED TO MAKE FIRST COURT APPEARANCE ON FEDERAL TAX CHARGES IN JULY\n\nThe case assignment appeared to come as a surprise to many of the potential jurors, who frequently answered that they were aware Hunter Biden was facing an upcoming trial, noting Delaware is a small state, but did not know their jury duty requests were related to the case.\n\nWith jury selection wrapped, the trial will begin in earnest on Tuesday with opening arguments. Prosecutors said at the tail end of the day that their first witness will be FBI Special Agent Erica Jensen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden is also facing a criminal tax trial in California, which will begin in September, after he was charged with three felonies and six misdemeanors regarding $1.4 million in owed taxes. Biden pleaded not guilty in that case and the taxes have since been paid.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_colton@foxnews.com",

He is pictured left posing nude with a gun\n\nAnd today, DailyMail.com can reveal that just three days after the firearm purchase, on October 15, Joe left Hunter a voicemail message indicating that he knew his son was struggling.\n\n'It's Dad. I'm calling to tell you I love you. I love you more than the whole world, pal. You've gotta get some help,' the president is heard saying in the audio clip.\n\n'I don't know what to do, I know you don't either. I'm here, no matter what you need. No matter what you need, I love you.'\n\nRead More Teary-eyed Hunter Biden gives Jill a hug and tells her a joke on her birthday as she supports him in court at the start of his gun trial\n\nHunter wrote in his memoir, Beautiful Things, that he was a 'full blown' crack addict at the time. The book will be used as evidence in Hunter's trial.\n\nJoe followed up with another voicemail on October 19, saying: 'Hey it's Dad again I'm down in Newport News Virginia, it's about 4 o'clock.\n\n'I'm just calling to check. Just text me or something, let me know you're ok. Ok? I love you.'\n\nAccording to texts Hunter wrote to family members, Joe ended up paying tens of thousands of dollars for Hunter's repeated stints in rehab to treat his chronic crack cocaine addiction.\n\nAccording to pre-trial filings, prosecutors will be using material including texts and photos from Hunter's laptop to prove to the jury that he was knowingly addicted to crack at the time he signed the federal form.\n\nJoe's voicemail is not currently among the evidence listed in the court filings - but it is in prosecutors' possession, and could help bolster their case.\n\nDailyMail.com can reveal that the president had left his son a voicemail advising him to 'get some help' - suggesting he knew about his drug battle - three days after the gun purchase\n\nJoe's voicemail is not currently among the evidence listed in the court filings - but it is in prosecutors' possession, and could help bolster their case\n\nHunter allegedly lied on a firearm report (above) required for his gun transaction. A photo of the form shows he answered 'no' when asked if he was an 'unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance'\n\nSpecial Prosecutor David Weiss' deputies even hinted at 'messages with certain family members' that they may use in the trial if Hunter's lawyers try to claim the First Son didn't know he was an addict.\n\n'At present, the government has not included relevant messages with certain family members in the 1006 summary chart [a list of the prosecution's evidence], but the government reserves to the right to use such evidence and may do so if the defense advances a theory that the defendant did not know he was in prohibited status because these messages are evidence of his knowledge of his addiction and use of crack,' prosecutors Leo Wise and Derek Hines wrote in a May 20 court filing.\n\nHowever, any prospect of the President's messages to his son being played to the jury would be highly controversial, in a trial held in the Bidens' home state and power base.\n\nThe potentially incriminating voicemail also flies in the face of Joe's previous claim that his son did 'nothing wrong'.\n\nWhen questioned by MSNBC about Hunter's plea negotiations with prosecutors in May 2023, the President said: 'My son has done nothing wrong. I trust him. I have faith in him.'\n\nHunter bought the .38 revolver from Starquest Shooters in Delaware on October 12, 2018\n\nBut by then, Hunter's gun purchase form had been published for over a year, showing that in October 2018 he ticked a box saying that he was not addicted to any illicit substances, in order to buy his handgun.\n\nJoe's voicemail indicates that he knew his son was struggling with addiction at the time.\n\nPresident Biden has pushed for stricter gun regulations, signing into law a 2022 bill that widened the use of background checks with the aim of protecting children.\n\nDays after the First Son's gun purchase, his then-lover and brother's widow Hallie Biden dumped the firearm and bullets in a supermarket trash can opposite a high school in Wilmington.\n\nPolice later found it and questioned the couple, Delaware State Police reports published in pre-trial filings show.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in March 2023 (Creative Commons)\n\nOn Monday, June 3 in a Wilmington, Delaware courtroom -- with U.S District Judge Maryellen Noreika presiding -- jury selection in Hunter Biden's trial on gun charges got underway.\n\nRight-wing media outlets have been playing up the case, repeatedly pointing out that Hunter Biden is President Joe Biden's son and that he suffered from drug problems in the past. In California, the younger Biden is also facing tax charges.\n\nBut Hunter Biden, HuffPost reports, has found an unlikely defender: conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina).\n\nREAD MORE: 'All she has to do is shut up': Ex-GOP rep skewers RNC chair for risking Senate over Trump 'vanities'\n\nThe GOP senator told HuffPost, \"I think any average American who's done their taxes like Hunter Biden would have probably faced prosecution. However, I don't think the average American would have been charged with the gun thing. I don't see any good coming from that.\"\n\nHuffPost reporter Igor Bobic notes that Hunter Biden, in his 2021 memoir, \"admitted.... that he was habitually using crack cocaine at the time of the gun purchase.\"\n\n\"He has pleaded not guilty, and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department,\" Bobic explains. \"Opening arguments in his trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, (June 4). Biden's lawyers previously argued that the charges violate the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, citing a recent opinion by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court which declared that gun restrictions are unconstitutional unless they can trace their origins to sometime between the signing of the Bill of Rights and the end of the Civil War.\"\n\nBobic adds, \"Hunter Biden has also described the charges as politically motivated, claiming that Republicans are trying to 'kill' him in order to destroy his father's presidency.\"\n\nREAD MORE:Dems 'ought to hammer' this 'far from moderate' GOP candidate: expert\n\nThe HuffPost reporter also points out that the case \"represents the first prosecution in U.S. history of the child of a sitting president.\"", "source": {"uri":

Behind him sat First Lady Jill Biden in a show of solidarity. Seated next to her was Hunter's current wife, Melissa Cohen, and his half-sister, Ashley Biden, making the criminal proceedings feel like family court. An assembly of Secret Service agents surrounded the Biden family.\n\nOf the jury pool, many knew the Bidens in some way. It was like six degrees of separation: Delaware edition.\n\nOne potential juror said he used to play squash with Beau Biden, Hunter's late brother, and competed in at least one tournament together. But because he knew the Biden family \"fairly well\" and felt he couldn't be impartial, that juror was dismissed. The squash player also said his children played baseball with Beau's kids.\n\nAnother prospective juror worked at the same school as Jill Biden and met her husband. However, he was allowed to remain.\n\nOne woman was a bartender at the Two Stones Pub in Kinnett Square where she \"on and off\" served Hunter's uncle John T. Owens, the brother-in-law of President Joe Biden. She was permitted to stay in the pool until the peremptory striking period.\n\nAnother woman said she is an acquaintance of Hallie Biden, Beau Biden's widow with whom Hunter had an affair, and knew Beau personally. \"Beau was a friend of the family. We miss him,\" she said. She also said that her husband \"socializes\" with the Bidens and that both belong to the same social clubs. She was stricken for cause.\n\nIn another episode of Keeping Up With The Bidens, a juror said that her father-in-law is an air-traffic controller at Dover Air Force Base, so he sometimes coordinates with Secret Service. \"You know when he [President Biden] is coming in,\" she said.\n\nApparently, in Delaware, whether you've ever bumped into Biden is a test of whether you're a tried-and-true resident worthy of calling yourself a Delawarean.\n\nAccording to the musings of Delaware Online, there's a saying in some circles around Delaware, which points out the ubiquitousness of the president across his home state: \"If you haven't met Joe Biden, you're not really a Delawarean.\"\n\nWell, it is President Biden's stomping grounds, after all. Wilmington's train station is named after him. A picture of the president is hanging in the lobby of the federal courthouse. The city's visitors bureau tells tourists to \"Explore Joe Biden's Wilmington.\"\n\nAs for the political leanings of the jury pool, one woman said she primarily watches CNN and MSNBC, donated to Hillary Clinton, and even volunteered on her 2008 Kentucky presidential primary campaign (when she canvassed the streets for Clinton). Asked if she'd able to find the son of the sitting Democratic president guilty, she said, \"I don't see any relation.\" The judge kept her, though she was ultimately not picked.\n\nAnother woman was sent home after she mentioned reading reports about Hunter. Asked what opinion she's formed, if any, she said, \"Not a good one.\"\n\nOne man, who mentioned politically motivated prosecutions, specifically referencing President Donald Trump's hush money trial, was excused. \"It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when,\" he said.\n\nSimilarly, a woman was let go because she suggested this was a political prosecution -- but of Hunter Biden. The juror, who joined a 2016 \"resistance\" group in response to Trump's win and donated to a number of Democrats in the 2022 midterms, said she believes Hunter is being prosecuted because of who his famous father is. \"I think it's a very strong factor,\" she said. \"Other people might've done similar things but not had it brought to the same level of scrutiny.\"\n\nOne man said he heard about the case on Newsmax and Fox News, but was not sure he could give Hunter \"a fair shake.\"\n\nA Trump donor, who contributed to his 2016 campaign, was qualified, but didn't make the jury.\n\nHowever, a black woman who donated to President Barack Obama's campaign was approved to stay despite Biden being Obama's vice president. She was chosen as one of the four alternates.\n\nThe parties settled on an even six women and six men to make up the jury, the majority of whom are black.\n\nNAACP Delaware's leader, Richard Smith, was also in attendance and embraced Hunter as he exited the courtroom. \"I told him we support him and I told him the black community is with him,\" Smith reportedly said afterwards. \"We understand what he is going through. And said we love each other.\"\n\nToday, the newly seated jury will hear opening arguments followed by the first witness for the prosecution: the FBI agent in charge of investigating the case, who's expected to introduce digital evidence extracted from Hunter's infamous laptop.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Log in.\n\nJill Biden turned 73 on Monday and spent part of the day watching jury selection at the Delaware courthouse.\n\n\"Happy Birthday,\" Hunter Biden was overheard telling the first lady at one point, according to The Washington Post. \"I got you a special event.\"\n\nThe first lady returned to court on Tuesday for opening statements. Also attending at the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Courthouse in Wilmington was Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden.\n\nThe trial marks the first time in American history that a sitting president's child has been a defendant in a criminal trial. He is accused of lying about his then-drug use on federal paperwork when he bought a handgun in 2018.\n\nIn opening statements, his attorney, Abbe Lowell, argued that Biden kept the gun in a locked box until his sister-in-law-turned girlfriend, Hallie Biden, threw it in a grocery store trash can 11 days after its purchase.\n\nLowell suggested that Biden, an admitted recovering crack-cocaine addict, misread a federal firearms application and believed he was telling the truth when he affirmed that he was not an \"unlawful user\" of controlled substances, according to trial coverage by multiple news outlets.\n\nBiden may have believed he was being accurate because he was not using drugs at the time he filled out the paperwork, Lowell's opening statement suggested.\n\nThe president's son tried to strike a plea agreement with prosecutors last year, but that deal collapsed under Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee.\n\nThe visible presence of close family members can have a positive impact on jurors, experts say.\n\nIn the weeks before his conviction on Thursday on 34 felony records-falsification counts, Donald Trump attended his hush-money trial without his wife attending at all.\n\nTrump's son, Eric, attended roughly half the trial. Donald Trump, Jr., and daughter Tiffany Trump attended for several days. But a rotating cast of Republican Trump supporters was a constant trial presence.\n\nA spokesperson for Melania Trump did not immediately return a request for comment, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment on behalf of Jill Biden.\n\nBoth the Biden trial and Trump hush-money trial featured testimony that close family members could find difficult to sit through.\n\nIn Trump's trial, the jury and audience heard testimony about two of Trump's long-denied, alleged infidelities from nearly 20 years prior -- involving porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy Bunny Karen McDougal.\n\nIn his 2021 memoir \"Beautiful Things,\" Hunter revealed that he was smoking crack cocaine every 15 minutes back in 2018.\n\nPresident Biden reaffirmed his love for his son on Monday in a rare statement addressing his son's legal troubles.\n\n\"I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brent_d_griffiths@businessinsider.com", "name": "Brent D.

The group is slated to hear opening remarks by prosecutors from the office of special counsel David Weiss, who showed up to court Tuesday. Hunter's team will deliver their opening statements after.\n\nHunter, 54, arrived to the federal courthouse Tuesday morning wearing a suit and tie and an American flag pin on his lapel. He was accompanied again by his wife Melissa Cohen, who held his hand on their way inside.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden also came to court for a second day to support her stepson, as did Hunter's stepsister Ashley.\n\nProsecutors teased Monday that they will likely call FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen as their first witness, and the jury may see evidence of Hunter's infamous laptop.\n\n\"Jensen will introduce the defendant's messages included in the 1006 summary chart... admissions in his book/audiobook, as well as introduce other evidence included on the government's exhibit list,\" prosecutors previously wrote in their trial brief about the witness.\n\nThat summary chart features evidence construed in part from an authentic copy of the first son's hard drive.\n\nSpecifically, the chart \"accurately summarizes electronic evidence derived from search warrants of the defendant's Apple iCloud account and the defendant's laptop and hard drive,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nDuring a pretrial conference last month, Noreika gave the go-ahead for prosecutors to use select information from the laptop while permitting the defense to pose objections on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe summary chart features scores of Hunter Biden's communications, which prosecutors are banking on to prove that he was in fact addicted to crack cocaine when he purchased the .38 caliber revolver on Oct. 12, 2018.\n\nThe judge has ruled that prosecutors do not have to prove that the first son was high at the time of the purchase.\n\nText messages from Hunter Biden's laptop showed he corresponded with an individual not long before the gun purchase who has a rap sheet that includes drug charges. The two appear to have met up a day after the purchase, according to messages from his laptop.\n\nDuring jury selection Monday, whenever a potential jury noted a personal connection to law enforcement such as a cop in the family, Lowell almost always jumped at the chance to ask whether they'd be able to weigh law enforcement testimony evenly with potential witnesses brought by the defense.\n\nThe defense attorney also questioned potential jurors who had experience filling out paperwork to purchase a firearm about the extent to which they were guided by store employees -- hinting at another likely line of defense.\n\nLowell additionally pressed potential jurors who suggested drug addicts shouldn't be able to buy guns whether they could set aside their biases or they believed there's a distinction between being high while making the purchase and having an addiction problem in the past.\n\nThe onus will be on the government to prove the facts of the case, as Noreika repeatedly impressed upon the jurors on Monday.\n\nBeyond Hunter Biden's communications, prosecutors plan on using passages from his 2021 book, \"Beautiful Things\" in which he chronicled his addiction struggles.\n\nProsecutors have namedropped a suite of other potential witnesses in their trial brief, including Delaware State Police Senior Corporal Joshua Marley and former Delaware State Police Lieutenant Millard Greer to testify about the law enforcement response to Janssen's Market after the firearm was tossed into the trash.\n\nThey also revealed their plans to pursue testimony from an employee of Starquest Shooters who claims to have witnessed Hunter Biden fill out the sheet to purchase the gun, Forensic Chemist Dr. Jason Brewer about alleged cocaine residue on the gun pouch, and DEA Supervisory Special Agent Joshua Romig to provide testimony of coded language allegedly used in the first son's test messages.\n\nAdditionally, prosecutors teased plans to call forward three witnesses that The Post has identified as Hunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, ex-girlfriend Zoe Kestan, and Hallie Biden.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to all three counts against him.\n\nHe is facing a separate tax evasion case in Los Angeles slated to commence trial on Sept. 5.\n\nThe Delaware case is not expected to last longer than two weeks.", "source": {"uri":

Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison\n\nHunter is charged with one count of making false statements in a firearm purchase, another count of making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a licensed firearm dealer, and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nIf he is found guilty on all charges, he could face a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Each count also carries a maximum fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.\n\n2. Hunter's defense hinges on his drug addiction\n\nHunter's charges allege that he was addicted to drugs at the time he purchased the firearm, meaning prosecutors do not need to prove that he was in fact on drugs at the moment of the purchase.\n\nLegal analyst Gregg Jarrett said Hunter's main defense hinges on denial of addiction and rehab, with a backup defense of being too strung out to intend wrongdoing. His defense may also attempt to challenge the Second Amendment, despite his father's advocacy for stricter gun laws.\n\n3. Hunter's family members are attending the proceedings\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden, Hunter's stepmother, attended the first day of his trial alongside Hunter's sister, Ashley Biden, on Monday.\n\nHunter arrived at court while holding hands with wife Melissa Cohen Biden.\n\nHunter's father, President Biden, has not announced any plans to attend the proceedings.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Cohen_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Cohen Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Jarrett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Jarrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun law in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://livenews.foxnews.com/images/2024/06/ac315ba8cdf3bba45f824ae23f3da950.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623025", "eventUri": "eng-9623025", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Opening arguments begin on Tuesday.\n\nThe president released a statement in support of his son this week, reading:\n\nI am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\n\nHunter Biden is facing a federal gun charge. He's accused of purchasing and possessing a firearm while addicted to drugs. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty on three charges.\n\nKelly argued on her SiriusXM show on Monday that the president commenting on any criminal trial is \"inappropriate,\" also citing his statements on Donald Trump's hush money trial in Manhattan.\n\n\"It's still inappropriate,\" she said. \"It's not appropriate for a sitting president of the United States to be commenting on any sort of a criminal case. I said this last week when he commented on Trump. Stay out of it! Stop it!\"\n\nKelly argued the president is making a \"clear attempt\" to \"influence\" people in his son's trial, especially since it is in Delaware where the president is from.\n\n\"The Trump case still has to go up on appeal, your son's case is in the process of jury selection. So be quiet! Shut up!\" she said. \"Pipe down, you don't have to comment on everything.

His attorneys are expected to attempt to poke holes in the government's charges and argue that the evidence is flawed.\n\nProsecutors, through court filings, have indicated they will highlight portions from Biden's memoir Beautiful Things, in which the first son wrote about how he had a desperate crack addiction around the same time frame as the gun purchase.\n\nThey also plan to introduce messages and photos from Biden's computer data, which have been a source of salacious headlines for years. After opening statements, the government's first witness, it said, would be FBI agent Erika Jensen, who will confirm parts of the memoir and text messages.\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" Biden wrote in one such message on Oct. 14, 2018, two days after the gun purchase.\n\nBiden, for his part, has indicated in court filings that he plans to dispute technicalities of his drug use, such as the definition of \"user of controlled substances.\" He also has signaled that he plans to raise authenticity questions about the computer data.\n\nHis defense attorneys are also expected to question the credibility of the gun form because prosecutors will be using as evidence a second version of the form with additional address information on it, rather than the original form.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika, a Donald Trump appointee, dealt a blow to Biden at the start of the trial by prohibiting him from introducing the original version of the form as evidence. Still, Biden could raise the argument through questions to the government's witnesses, such as the employees of the gun store.\n\nOpening arguments follow a quick one-day jury selection on Monday.

After facing questions from attorneys, six men and six women, as well as four alternates were selected and sworn in. The group included an Obama voter, gun owners and people who have seen addiction up close. A powerful quorum of allies and family members were also in attendance to show their support, including First Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's half-sister, Ashley; and Kevin Morris, the entertainment lawyer who is helping pay Hunter Biden's legal fees.

Modi enjoys wide support both at home and among the large Indian diaspora in the U.S. and elsewhere, with voters rewarding a leader they see as responsible for India's rocketing economy and rising confidence on the world stage.\n\nHis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and allied parties appeared to have secured almost 300 of 543 seats in Parliament, according to early results, giving them a simple majority. But the opposition was doing better than expected in an election that exit polls had suggested Modi's alliance would win by a landslide.\n\nBut critics say Modi has also eroded human rights in India, the world's largest democracy, and stoked religious tensions, particularly against India's Muslim minority, with Modi and other BJP candidates accused of hate speech and other inflammatory rhetoric during the campaign. India is also struggling to provide enough jobs for its 1.4 billion people, despite being the world's fastest-growing major economy.\n\nAn extreme heat wave has taken hold in Texas, and more pre-summer heat is in store for the Southwest in the first significant heat event of the season. Temperatures across Texas will feel as hot as 115 degrees, particularly in Abilene, San Antonio and Brownsville, and severe storms are anticipated in the Panhandle.\n\nThe National Weather Service is forecasting a heat wave throughout Arizona and parts of California through Thursday, with temperatures potentially climbing to 113 degrees in Phoenix and 108 in California's Central Valley. The high temperatures also bring with it a fire risk. As of last night, the Corral Fire near San Francisco, which had grown to more than 14,000 acres, was about 75% contained. Here's what to know about this week's forecast.\n\nThis summer's heat will likely be costly, too. The average cost of keeping an American home cool from June to September is set to hit $719, the highest in a decade and a steep rise from a $573 average in 2021, according to new projections. If temperatures continue to break records, the average cost could be even higher.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive action today that would temporarily shut down the southern border -- and could go into effect immediately.\n\nThe executive order is expected to rely on a provision in the U.S. Code that gives the president authority to \"suspend the entry\" of certain migrants whenever the number of attempted border crossings is too high. For the executive action, that number is 2,500 people, and the border would reopen when the number falls to below 1,500, according to three people familiar with the discussion.\n\nDaily encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border are currently averaging more than 4,000, according to Homeland Security Department officials, which suggests a shutdown could go into effect immediately.\n\nA critical consideration before the Biden administration's anticipated action was working with the administration of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the outgoing Mexican president who supported Claudia Sheinbaum, who won this week's election. Here's what else to know.\n\nA former small-town mayor accused in a triple-murder in South Dakota became enraged after his wife told him that a neighbor had sexually assaulted her, according to new court documents. Jay Ostrem, the former mayor of Centerville, about 40 miles south of Sioux Falls, was arrested last week in the deaths of three men found dead with apparent gunshot wounds. Now, a probable cause affidavit alleges that Ostrem's wife told him shortly before the shootings that a man she had been drinking with forcibly kissed her and exposed himself, prompting Ostrem to leave \"raging out of the house.\"\n\nOne of the victims called 911 to report that his brother had been shot and killed by \"a guy from across the street,\" according to the document. Then, the caller said he had been shot too.\n\nToday's primaries: Sen.

Meanwhile, multiple snap polls released in recent days reveal what Americans think of the verdict. And President Biden said at a campaign event last night that Trump is a \"convicted felon\" who \"snapped\" after the 2020 election.\n\nWant more politics news?

New research suggests there's another layer of stress added to your body if you're one who likes to order a mid-flight drink and then take a nap. It turns out the lower air pressure at higher altitudes can alter your blood oxygen saturation and your heart rate. The results were so surprising that one of the study's co-authors warned: \"Please don't drink alcohol while being on an airplane.\" -- Elizabeth Robinson, newsletter editor\n\nDid you know you're supposed to be regularly cleaning your dishwasher?

His attorneys are expected to attempt to poke holes in the government's charges and argue that the evidence is flawed.\n\nProsecutors, through court filings, have indicated they will highlight portions from Biden's memoir Beautiful Things, in which the first son wrote about how he had a desperate crack addiction around the same time frame as the gun purchase.\n\nThey also plan to introduce messages and photos from Biden's computer data, which have been a source of salacious headlines for years. After opening statements, the government's first witness, it said, would be FBI agent Erika Jensen, who will confirm parts of the memoir and text messages.\n\n\"I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney,\" Biden wrote in one such message on Oct. 14, 2018, two days after the gun purchase.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBiden, for his part, has indicated in court filings that he plans to dispute technicalities of his drug use, such as the definition of \"user of controlled substances.\" He also has signaled that he plans to raise authenticity questions about the computer data.\n\nHis defense attorneys are also expected to question the credibility of the gun form because prosecutors will be using as evidence a second version of the form with additional address information on it, rather than the original form.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika, a Donald Trump appointee, dealt a blow to Biden at the start of the trial by prohibiting him from introducing the original version of the form as evidence. Still, Biden could raise the argument through questions to the government's witnesses, such as the employees of the gun store.\n\nOpening arguments follow a quick one-day jury selection on Monday. Twelve jurors and four alternates were chosen from an initial pool of roughly 250 people. Several of the jurors said during the selection process that they knew family members with drug addictions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBiden is facing three felony charges related to the gun purchase and up to 25 years in prison.

Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean. As the President, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\"\n\nNow, his statement that \"I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases\" was a bunch of nonsense as Moore noted, considering he's commented on multiple cases. Notice he also slipped in \"federal\" cases so he could draw a distinction between that and his comments about the Manhattan DA's prosecution of former and possibly future President Donald Trump, where his campaign surrogates (including a deranged Robert De Niro) even showed up outside the courthouse to rant. Um, Joe? You're not supposed to be inserting yourself in any case, federal or otherwise. At least, that has been the norm, but of course, he's blown that to smithereens.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nJoe Biden's Suspect Statement Regarding Hunter Ahead of Delaware Trial on Gun Charges\n\nThe comment is also funny because he's saying he's not commenting even as he is in fact commenting and even throwing a prospective defense out there. What an amazing and brave lad Hunter has been to overcome his addiction! But hey, jury, don't pay attention to me exerting my power here; just pretend you didn't hear this. I'm not at all trying to comment on this case. But that's Joe Biden, what he says is so frequently the opposite of the truth.\n\nBut it may have an effect when you look at the nature of the six men and six women on the jury.\n\nJury selection lasted the entirety of the day, with the majority of potential jurors telling the court that they have personally experienced addiction issues through their friends and family. Many of the jurors, no matter their racial background, sex or age, responded that they have had a relative who struggled with drug addiction or alcoholism.\n\nAs Townhall's Mia Cathell detailed, some of the people who had relatives or people close to them who suffered from addiction made it onto the jury. There was even a woman who used to work for the Secret Service. They're supposed to only consider the facts of the case as placed before them, and they are supposed to be impartial, but how will their experiences affect how they consider this case? The Biden team may think all this goes to their benefit, but we will have to see.\n\nRelated:\n\nLawyers, Guns, and Money: Hunter Biden Delaware Trial - Day 1\n\nPotential Jurors on Hunter Biden Case Face Questions on Guns, Addiction With Some Surprising Results", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_arama@redstate.com", "name": "Nick Arama", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Internet", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/269/ec30bb8e-da53-4abf-b03b-f9014bec30b6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623025", "eventUri": "eng-9623025", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Biden has pleaded not guilty to federal gun charges.\n\nFollowing a yearslong investigation, Weiss charged Biden with making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm; making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a licensed firearm dealer; and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: HUNTER BIDEN ON TRIAL FOR FEDERAL GUN CRIMES\n\nOn Tuesday morning, prosecutors showed a list of witnesses who may be called to testify. Here is who they are:\n\nThe first prosecution witness sworn in on Tuesday was FBI special agent Erika Jensen. Prosecutors said in a court filing that Jensen will introduce evidence including text messages and admissions in his memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" which the government says shows Biden was using illicit drugs at the time he purchased a firearm.\n\nThe indictment of Biden said that he certified on a federally mandated form \"that he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.\"\n\nBiden and Kathleen Buhle were married from 1993 to 2017. Buhle has spoken publicly about Biden's drug addiction and many affairs, including his sister-in-law and widow of his late brother, Beau, Hallie Biden, who is also a witness for the prosecution. Buhle detailed difficulties in her marriage to Biden in a 2022 memoir titled, \"IF We Break: A Memoir of Marriage, Addiction, and Healing.\"\n\nProsecutors said that throughout 2018, Buhl would search Biden's car because \"she did not want their children in a vehicle with drugs.\" She found drugs or drug paraphernalia about a dozen times, according to court documents. A 2018 text message exchange with Biden said, \"I also found a few crack pipes. I took them out because our daughter was driving the car,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nZoe Kestan is another former romantic partner of Biden. Prosecutors hope Kestan will highlight the first son's former use of crack cocaine, \"every 20 minutes except when he slept.\" They allege Kestan visited Biden in Massachusetts when he was in rehab in the fall of 2018, after he purchased his gun, and observed him using drugs.\n\nUS V HUNTER BIDEN: OPENING STATEMENTS TO BEGIN IN FIRST SON'S FEDERAL GUN TRIAL AFTER JURY SEATED\n\nProsecutors will also call Biden's sister-in-law, Hallie Biden, to testify about his drug use. The pair were in a romantic relationship in 2018. Hallie Biden observed Hunter using drugs on multiple occasions, according to prosecutors, and she and her children discovered drug paraphernalia and drugs in his possession when they searched his bags, backpacks and vehicle in an effort to help him get sober.\n\nHallie Biden, identified as Witness 3, \"observed that the defendant frequently lost phones and changed phones, which explains gaps in time where there are no messages, and she also had various text message exchanges with the defendant,\" prosecutors said.\n\nGordon Cleveland is an employee of Starquest Shooters and Survival Supply in Wilmington, Delaware, who sold Biden a gun. He will be called to testify that Biden purchased a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver, a HKS Speedloader for the .38 special and 25 rounds of Hornady \"American Gunner\" ammunition.\n\nCleveland is expected to tell jurors that Biden completed ATF Form 4473, federally required background check paperwork, which asked whether he was an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any depressant, stimulant, or narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance, and that Biden lied and answered, \"no.\" If Biden had answered, \"yes,\" the gun seller could not have sold him a gun, prosecutors said.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN'S CRIMINAL TRIAL ON FEDERAL GUN CHARGES BEGINS WITH JURY SELECTION\n\nDelaware State Police Senior Corporal Joshua Marley will testify about his response to an incident at Janssen's Market, Biden's admissions and about evidence recovered, prosecutors said.\n\nThe gun Biden purchased was discovered in a trash can outside Janssen's Market, a grocery store in Greenville, Delaware, in 2018. According to a police report, Hallie Biden allegedly took Hunter's gun and threw it in a trash can behind the store, which was located across the street from a high school. She later returned and found the gun missing, Politico reported.\n\nFormer Delaware State Lieutenant Millard Greer will testify about his recovery of the gun, ammunition, speedloader and brown leather pouch from the man who found them in the trash receptacle at Janssen's Market, prosecutors said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nProsecutors may call DEA Supervisory Special Agent Joshua Romig as an expert witness on \"coded messages\" allegedly sent by Biden, which will prove his drug use and support the government's allegation that Biden lied on a federal gun form.\n\nA forensic chemist, Dr. Jason Brewer, will be asked about his analysis of the brown leather pouch that allegedly belonged to Biden and his opinion that the residue is cocaine based on his testing and evidence, prosecutors said.\n\nFox News' Aubrie Spady contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_pandolfo@foxnews.com",

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nAmerica's judicial system is, apparently, not so rigged, after all.\n\nAfter spending the last three days raging against the courts over Donald Trump's 34 felony convictions, the right-wing media machine jumped at the opportunity to hype the felony charges being brought against Hunter Biden in a trial that got underway Monday.\n\nOutlets like Fox News -- where figures such as Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Jesse Watters and a parade of others have spent weeks bashing the legal system, even going as far as to portray the unanimous jury verdict to be part of a deep-state conspiracy against the disgraced former president -- were more than happy to place a bright spotlight on the case facing President Joe Biden's son.\n\nThe cognitive dissonance is remarkable to behold. The same media outlets and figures who have told their audiences that there is a \"two-tiered justice system\" in America, are now prominently covering a trial in which Biden's own Justice Department prosecutes his son. If Biden is rigging the justice system, he is doing a lousy job.\n\nThe trial offers a timely distraction from the uncomfortable reality of Trump's felony convictions and marks the culmination of years of right-wing attacks and obsession of the president's son, offering a regular serving of red meat for Fox News' prime time audience over claims of wrongdoing and innuendo surrounding the purported \"Biden Crime Family.\"\n\nTo be clear, the unprecedented nature of a president's own son going on trial for felony charges warrants significant coverage. However, while Trump's trial was treated as an illegitimate \"sham\" by the MAGA Media machine, the Hunter Biden trial is being portrayed in a markedly different light. Oddly, the charges brought against President Biden's son don't represent \"election interference.\" Apparently, that's only a one way street.\n\nWhile there is not a \"two-tiered justice system\" in the country, there certainly is a two-tiered set of standards that outlets like Fox News apply to the Democratic Party versus the Republican Party.\n\nNot only are the charges against Hunter Biden being taken very seriously by the same outlets which have spilled untold amounts of ink blasting the courts, but these same outlets are also dishonestly attempting to tie President Biden to the alleged crimes of his son, despite the fact that the GOP has been unable to uncover any evidence establishing such a link. And, suffice to say, it is not like the Republican Party has not tried.\n\nRegardless of what happens in the Hunter Biden trial, however, Trump's media allies will still undoubtedly claim that the justice system is rigged. If Hunter Biden is acquitted or the jury is hung, the right-wing media machine will use it to further their dishonest narrative that the judicial system is corrupt and only working to target Republicans. But, even if Hunter Biden is found guilty, audiences will be told that he got off easy and should have been hit with more severe charges.\n\nIt's a win-win for MAGA Media, because the space is dominated by outlets and figures who are at their core dishonest, choosing to instead peddle certain narratives for profit and power.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_darcy@cnn.com", "name": "Oliver Darcy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Watters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Watters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laura Ingraham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognitive dissonance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2155936346.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623025", "eventUri": "eng-9623025", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Triple-digit heat moves across the Southwest. And court documents allege a former small-town mayor accused in three murders was enraged by his wife's revelation of a sexual assault.\n\nHere's what to know today.\n\nOpening statements are set to begin this morning in the federal criminal trial of Hunter Biden, who faces three counts tied to a possession of a gun while using narcotics.\n\nProsecutors from special counsel David Weiss' office will lay out their case against President Joe Biden's son, arguing that Hunter Biden certified on a federally mandated form that he wasn't illegally using or addicted to illegal drugs, \"when in fact ... that statement was false and fictitious.\"\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe opening statements come a day after the trial in Wilmington, Delaware, opened with jury selection. After facing questions from attorneys, six men and six women, as well as four alternates were selected and sworn in. The group included an Obama voter, gun owners and people who have seen addiction up close. A powerful quorum of allies and family members were also in attendance to show their support, including First Lady Jill Biden, Hunter Biden's half-sister, Ashley; and Kevin Morris, the entertainment lawyer who is helping pay Hunter Biden's legal fees. Read more takeaways from Day 1 of the trial, as the first family's long history, and deep Delaware roots, loomed over jury selection.\n\nAfter opening statements from both sides, testimony begins with the prosecution's first witness, an FBI special agent who will introduce evidence including text messages and excerpts from Hunter Biden's book and audiobook. Here's what else to expect.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day.

Modi enjoys wide support both at home and among the large Indian diaspora in the U.S. and elsewhere, with voters rewarding a leader they see as responsible for India's rocketing economy and rising confidence on the world stage.\n\nHis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and allied parties appeared to have secured almost 300 of 543 seats in Parliament, according to early results, giving them a simple majority. But the opposition was doing better than expected in an election that exit polls had suggested Modi's alliance would win by a landslide.\n\nBut critics say Modi has also eroded human rights in India, the world's largest democracy, and stoked religious tensions, particularly against India's Muslim minority, with Modi and other BJP candidates accused of hate speech and other inflammatory rhetoric during the campaign. India is also struggling to provide enough jobs for its 1.4 billion people, despite being the world's fastest-growing major economy.\n\nAn extreme heat wave has taken hold in Texas, and more pre-summer heat is in store for the Southwest in the first significant heat event of the season. Temperatures across Texas will feel as hot as 115 degrees, particularly in Abilene, San Antonio and Brownsville, and severe storms are anticipated in the Panhandle.\n\nThe National Weather Service is forecasting a heat wave throughout Arizona and parts of California through Thursday, with temperatures potentially climbing to 113 degrees in Phoenix and 108 in California's Central Valley. The high temperatures also bring with it a fire risk. As of last night, the Corral Fire near San Francisco, which had grown to more than 14,000 acres, was about 75% contained. Here's what to know about this week's forecast.\n\nThis summer's heat will likely be costly, too. The average cost of keeping an American home cool from June to September is set to hit $719, the highest in a decade and a steep rise from a $573 average in 2021, according to new projections. If temperatures continue to break records, the average cost could be even higher.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive action today that would temporarily shut down the southern border -- and could go into effect immediately.\n\nThe executive order is expected to rely on a provision in the U.S. Code that gives the president authority to \"suspend the entry\" of certain migrants whenever the number of attempted border crossings is too high. For the executive action, that number is 2,500 people, and the border would reopen when the number falls to below 1,500, according to three people familiar with the discussion.\n\nDaily encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border are currently averaging more than 4,000, according to Homeland Security Department officials, which suggests a shutdown could go into effect immediately.\n\nA critical consideration before the Biden administration's anticipated action was working with the administration of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the outgoing Mexican president who supported Claudia Sheinbaum, who won this week's election. Here's what else to know.\n\nA former small-town mayor accused in a triple-murder in South Dakota became enraged after his wife told him that a neighbor had sexually assaulted her, according to new court documents. Jay Ostrem, the former mayor of Centerville, about 40 miles south of Sioux Falls, was arrested last week in the deaths of three men found dead with apparent gunshot wounds. Now, a probable cause affidavit alleges that Ostrem's wife told him shortly before the shootings that a man she had been drinking with forcibly kissed her and exposed himself, prompting Ostrem to leave \"raging out of the house.\"\n\nOne of the victims called 911 to report that his brother had been shot and killed by \"a guy from across the street,\" according to the document. Then, the caller said he had been shot too.\n\nToday's primaries: Sen. Bob Menendez's bribery and corruption trial looms large over key primary elections today in New Jersey, including one House race involving his son. Here's what to know -- plus other races to watch in Iowa, Montana, New Mexico and South Dakota.\n\nFauci fights back: Dr. Anthony Fauci fended off attacks from Republican politicians at a fiery House subcommittee hearing in which various members asked about Covid conspiracy theories.\n\nTrump verdict aftermath: The addresses and phone numbers of Michael Cohen's family members were posted to a doxxing website. Meanwhile, multiple snap polls released in recent days reveal what Americans think of the verdict. And President Biden said at a campaign event last night that Trump is a \"convicted felon\" who \"snapped\" after the 2020 election.\n\nWant more politics news?

New research suggests there's another layer of stress added to your body if you're one who likes to order a mid-flight drink and then take a nap. It turns out the lower air pressure at higher altitudes can alter your blood oxygen saturation and your heart rate. The results were so surprising that one of the study's co-authors warned: \"Please don't drink alcohol while being on an airplane.\" -- Elizabeth Robinson, newsletter editor\n\nDid you know you're supposed to be regularly cleaning your dishwasher?

While buying the revolver in Delaware, Biden lied on a federal form, swearing that he was not using, and was not addicted to, any illegal drugs - even though he was struggling with crack cocaine addiction at the time of the purchase.\n\nMore context: It's a federal crime to lie on the ATF form or to possess a firearm as a drug user. He possessed the gun for 11 days in 2018.\n\nIf convicted on all counts, Biden could theoretically face as much as 25 years in prison and fines of up to $750,000, according to court filings.\n\nHowever, defendants very rarely get the maximum penalty, especially in cases like these, involving non-violent crimes and an alleged first-time offender.\n\nThe charges followed a botched agreement: Last June, Weiss announced a two-pronged agreement where Biden would plead guilty to two federal tax misdemeanors and enter a \"diversion agreement\" where the gun charge would be dropped in two years if he passed regular drug tests and stayed out of legal trouble.\n\nHowever, at a July 2023 hearing, the agreement collapsed after a judge said she had \"concerns\" about the parties seemingly linking the tax plea agreement to resolving a felony gun charge.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nAmerica's judicial system is, apparently, not so rigged, after all.\n\nAfter spending the last three days raging against the courts over Donald Trump's 34 felony convictions, the right-wing media machine jumped at the opportunity to hype the felony charges being brought against Hunter Biden in a trial that got underway Monday.\n\nOutlets like Fox News -- where figures such as Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Jesse Watters and a parade of others have spent weeks bashing the legal system, even going as far as to portray the unanimous jury verdict to be part of a deep-state conspiracy against the disgraced former president -- were more than happy to place a bright spotlight on the case facing President Joe Biden's son.\n\nThe cognitive dissonance is remarkable to behold. The same media outlets and figures who have told their audiences that there is a \"two-tiered justice system\" in America, are now prominently covering a trial in which Biden's own Justice Department prosecutes his son. If Biden is rigging the justice system, he is doing a lousy job.\n\nThe trial offers a timely distraction from the uncomfortable reality of Trump's felony convictions and marks the culmination of years of right-wing attacks and obsession of the president's son, offering a regular serving of red meat for Fox News' prime time audience over claims of wrongdoing and innuendo surrounding the purported \"Biden Crime Family.\"\n\nTo be clear, the unprecedented nature of a president's own son going on trial for felony charges warrants significant coverage. However, while Trump's trial was treated as an illegitimate \"sham\" by the MAGA Media machine, the Hunter Biden trial is being portrayed in a markedly different light. Oddly, the charges brought against President Biden's son don't represent \"election interference.\" Apparently, that's only a one way street.\n\nWhile there is not a \"two-tiered justice system\" in the country, there certainly is a two-tiered set of standards that outlets like Fox News apply to the Democratic Party versus the Republican Party.\n\nNot only are the charges against Hunter Biden being taken very seriously by the same outlets which have spilled untold amounts of ink blasting the courts, but these same outlets are also dishonestly attempting to tie President Biden to the alleged crimes of his son, despite the fact that the GOP has been unable to uncover any evidence establishing such a link. And, suffice to say, it is not like the Republican Party has not tried.\n\nRegardless of what happens in the Hunter Biden trial, however, Trump's media allies will still undoubtedly claim that the justice system is rigged. If Hunter Biden is acquitted or the jury is hung, the right-wing media machine will use it to further their dishonest narrative that the judicial system is corrupt and only working to target Republicans. But, even if Hunter Biden is found guilty, audiences will be told that he got off easy and should have been hit with more severe charges.\n\nIt's a win-win for MAGA Media, because the space is dominated by outlets and figures who are at their core dishonest, choosing to instead peddle certain narratives for profit and power.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Much of the questioning of potential jurors revolved around whether they had friends or family members who had struggled with addiction. After selection, jurors were ordered by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika not to talk or read about the case as the trial moves forward.\n\nBoth the prosecution and the defense struck several potential jurists from the initial jury pool, including individuals who volunteered for Hillary Clinton, who read the Guardian and watch CNN, and one who had met John \"Jack\" Owens, Joe Biden's brother-in-law, when she was a bartender, according to a report at Breitbart.com.\n\nIn 2018, Hunter Biden, now 54, purchased a firearm from a licensed dealer, and, while filling in Form 4473, responded \"no\" to the question of whether he was \"an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.\" However, per Hunter's own account of his addiction -- as chronicled in his 2021 book, Beautiful Things -- it is almost certain that he was an addict at the time he purchased the gun.\n\nUnder the terms of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 -- a law that then-Sen. Joe Biden shepherded through the U.S. Senate -- lying on Form 4473 is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison.\n\nInterestingly, Biden's defense team is expected to utilize a tactic used earlier in a federal court proceeding, where his attorneys argued that the charges of lying on a federal background check form and possessing a firearm while addicted to unlawful substances were \"unprecedented\" and \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nAt odds is whether the law barring lying on the background check form and another law forbidding drug addicts from possessing firearms is constitutional under the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. By the new standard, for the law to be constitutional prosecutors must show that there exists a \"historical precedent from before, during and even after the founding [that] evidences a comparable tradition of regulation?\"\n\nThe irony is, of course, that President Biden continues to call for \"enhanced\" and even \"universal\" background checks for firearm sales, even as his son's attorneys are expected to argue that the existing background check law is unconstitutional.\n\nThe trial is expected to last one to two weeks. It comes a year after a sweetheart plea deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors fell apart under Judge Noreika's scrutiny.\n\nThe charges carry a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, though as a first-time offender, he is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence. In fact, it is unlikely he would see any jail time.\n\nThe younger Biden also faces a number of tax charges, including tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time.

But its more salacious contents, including explicit photos and videos of Hunter Biden, have continuously stoked the fire of controversy.\n\nIts reemergence in court echoes the sordid tales that came out of former Trump's hush money trial, where porn star Stormy Daniels testified on her alleged sexual encounter with Trump a decade before the 2016 election. Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the hush money payment Daniels' received to keep that story out of the public conversation.\n\nHere is what to know about Biden's laptop:\n\nHunter Biden trial live updates: Opening arguments expected to begin Tuesday\n\nJohn Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of The Mac Shop in Wilmington, Delaware, said a man identifying himself as Hunter Biden brought in three liquid-damaged laptops in April 2019.\n\nOne laptop was left behind, and Mac Isaac said at the time he shared the device with Robert Costello, Rudy Giuliani's lawyer who also testified at Trump's hush money trial, because he believed it would make him safer.\n\nGiuliani, who had been looking for information to damage Biden's presidential campaign, shared the contents of the laptop with the New York Post and local police.\n\nThe laptop materials were used as fodder in a conspiracy Giuliani had been pushing for months. At the center of the story, largely debunked, was that Joe Biden intervened in Ukraine while sitting as vice president to help Hunter Biden, who was a board member on Ukrainian energy company Bursima.\n\nThe conspiracy alleged Joe Biden tried to help oust a Ukrainian prosecutor to thwart an investigation into Burisma.\n\nThe laptop dump yielded an email purportedly showing a Burisma adviser thanking Hunter Biden for setting up a meeting with Joe Biden while he was vice president during the Obama administration.\n\nInformation from the laptop also contributed to impeachment inquiries of President Biden, but committees have not yet found wrongdoing. The White House has dismissed investigations as a partisan effort against the President.\n\nMore: House Republicans issue new report on Joe Biden corruption... that again offers no evidence\n\nThe laptop breach also revealed photos of Biden using drugs, naked and engaged in intimate relations with other adults.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. R-Ga., displayed sexually explicit photos of Biden in a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing in July 2023.\n\nIn the years since the laptop's contents was published, Huntr Biden has sued several people involved.\n\nBiden lawyer Abbe Lowell filed an ethics complaint against Greene days after the hearing, calling her actions, \"a new level of abhorrent behavior.\"\n\nIn September 2023, Biden sued Giuliani and Costello for allegedly copying, manipulating and distributing the records in a \"total annihilation\" of his privacy.\n\nBiden and the computer repair man Mac Isaac are also amidst dueling lawsuits.\n\nBiden claims that Mac Isaac invaded his privacy. Mac Isaac claims Biden, as well as media outlets CNN and Politico, conspired to defame him by implying the leaked laptop material was a Russian effort to meddle in the 2020 election.\n\nIn February, both sides argued to a judge that their legal claims should prevail without trial. That ruling remains pending.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

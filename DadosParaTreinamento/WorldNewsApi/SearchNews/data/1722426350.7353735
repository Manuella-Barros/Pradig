{"id": 243347734, "title": "Editorial: Sinn Fein seems to think that Michelle O'Neill is incapable of answering questions", "text": "Almost Michelle O\u2019Neill\u2019s first words in Tuesday\u2019s interview for BBC\u2019s \u2018The View\u2019 were that this election is about \u201cstrong leadership\u201d. It was a typically self-congratulatory remark from the Sinn Fein leader, who has been first minister of Northern Ireland since February. And yet Ms O\u2019Neill has shown anything but strong leadership when it has come to being grilled in this campaign. She ducked the UTV leaders\u2019 debate. She ducked the \u2018Talkback\u2019 radio interview with William Crawley. And on Thursday she ducked the BBC TV leaders\u2019 debate. While Doug Beattie was also absent on Thursday, only Ms O\u2019Neill among the leaders of the five biggest Stormont parties was absent in three of these four key tests of their ability to explain themselves. This has let Ms O\u2019Neill evade questioning on her key role in the Bobby Storey IRA funeral, which should have seen her banished from public life, let alone from leading this society. Having for four years shrilly defended her conduct that day, when thousands of Ulster folk obeyed limits for burying their own loved ones, she suddenly apologised when the Covid Inquiry came to Belfast this year, no doubt realising it would not be as easily placated as the other feeble probes into the Storey mass Covid breach. In fact even Ms O\u2019Neill\u2019s substitute on \u2018Talkback\u2019, Conor Murphy, was allowed to escape scrutiny of that funeral by saying he had yet to appear before the inquiry. It was reminiscent of the way the DUP, which did not delete its Covid WhatsApp messages, got all the negative headlines whereas SF, which \u2013 disgracefully \u2013 did delete theirs, avoided such scrutiny. Ms O\u2019Neill, who has attended numerous celebrations of past IRA terror, was able to present herself on the Shankill on Thursday, the day of the debate, as a generous, non tribal leader. In truth she lacks such qualities: and her party seems to think she lacks the ability to answer questions.", "summary": "News Letter editorial on Saturday June 29 2024:", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/editorial-sinn-fein-seems-to-think-that-michelle-oneill-is-incapable-of-answering-questions-4684419", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjZkMzNiOTdjLTYxZDEtNDAwNy05Njc2LTkzODJhNzlmOThmODpmMDhiNDZjNi1hNTlhLTQ5NjAtOGQ1Ny0xMjY3NzYwNDg3YjE=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:40:47", "author": "Editorial", "authors": ["Editorial"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.113}

{"id": 232018000, "title": "Mum bars son, 22, from listening to 'explicit' music \u2013 and everyone has same response", "text": "A mother has barred her family from listening to \"explicit\" music as she feels \"conflicted\" about paying for it. She changed the settings on the family Spotify account meaning no users were able to access songs or albums with explicit content. The safe listening feature has annoyed her son, who took to Reddit to complain. He wrote: \"My mom just shut off explicit content on Spotify for our whole family plan. I am 22 & just moved a couple of states away from them. I just wanted to listen to some Kendrick.\" He also shared a text exchange with his mother, where he asked if there was an issue with their account. It read: \"It says on Spotify my account manager turned off explicit content and I'm trying to listen to a new album, was that on your side or did it just update or something in setting and I have to fix it myself?\" His mother replied: \"I'm feeling a little conflicted paying for explicit content. I just switched it because I was testing it I didn't even know that it was an option. I always have mine off. Anyway I'll let you know soon what is decided.\" The original poster suggested his mum \"just turn it on and off for different people\", but the mother was adamant on keeping explicit content turned off. He then offered to pay for his own Spotify plan, so he could still listen to his favourite tunes. The mother wrote back: \"Maybe, but I still feel conflicted providing explicit material... I might just turn it on. If you do that let me know. I'll turn yours off. I'm sorry I'm just conflicted over it.\" And people replying to the post (which has since racked up 43,000 upvotes) all said the same thing, suggesting the son just pay for his own account. One user wrote: \"There\u2019s a student plan if you have a usable email address.\" A second suggested: \"Sounds like it's time to start your own account.\" A third wrote: \"Just get your own Spotify plan. It\u2019s free with ads and you can control the content yourself.\" It appears the original poster is set on doing so, replying: \"Yeah that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing once I get my first paycheck, I just moved and money is tight.\"", "summary": "A Spotify family plan has caused a divide after the mother barred the rest of her loved ones from listening to 'explicit' music as she feels 'conflicted' about paying for the songs", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/mum-bars-son-22-listening-32992465", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32992606.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/6_Keep-calm-and-let-the-music-play-on.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:45:02", "author": "Ewan Gleadow,Ewan-Gleadow", "authors": ["Ewan Gleadow", "Ewan-Gleadow"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.331}

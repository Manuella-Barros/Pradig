The attacks in the regional capital of Makhachkala and the city of Derbent on Sunday killed 21 people \u2014 most of them police officers \u2014 and injured at least 43 others in the restive region in the North Caucasus on the Caspian Sea. Chief Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar said a 110-year-old Derbent synagogue, which was a center for Jewish life in the region, was destroyed in a fire during the attacks. Among those slain was the Rev. Nikolai Kotelnikov, a 66-year-old Russian Orthodox priest who was killed as the faithful gathered on Pentecost, also known as Trinity Sunday, at a church in Derbent, which is Russia's southernmost city and one of its oldest. \u201cThe message we are getting from the Jewish community in Dagestan is that they are not going to hide behind high walls and be intimidated by extremists,\u201d said Lazar, who is affiliated with the Chabad-Lubavitch organization that refurbished the synagogue 20 years ago. \u201cThey are going to practice their religion openly,\" he said. \"They are optimistic that the government will take steps to protect them. They believe they can rebuild and get stronger.\u201d In July 2013, Ovadia Isakov, who leads the Derbent synagogue, was shot while walking home in what officials called an antisemitic attack. Lazar said Isakov, who made a full recovery, now splits his time between Moscow and Derbent, serving that community during holidays and special occasions. In another incident, mobs rioted at the airport in Makhachkala as a flight landed from Tel Aviv shortly after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October. More than 20 people were injured when hundreds of men, some carrying banners with antisemitic slogans, rushed onto the tarmac, chased passengers and threw stones at police. The Derbent synagogue itself was almost like a \u201csecond rabbi\u201d with Isakov now living in Moscow, said Varvara Redmond, a Dublin-based doctoral student at the University of Warsaw who has visited Dagestan three times and studied the Juhuro, as the Jews of Dagestan are called. \u201cThe building essentially replaced the rabbi,\u201d Redmond said. \u201cEverything happens through the synagogue, right from the purchasing of kosher meat to funerals, weddings and circumcisions.\u201d Dagestan, with a population of about 3 million, is ethnically diverse with more than 40 tribes with as many languages. All are small communities with durable traditions. Marriage still largely takes place within the tribe. The Juhuro, also known as \u201cMountain Jews,\u201d came from the Caucasus Mountains and are proud of their identity, shunning the \u201cJewish diaspora\u201d label, Redmond said. While many Jews worldwide wish to be buried in Israel, Dagestani Jews are \u201cvery connected to their land\u201d and prefer it as their final resting place, regardless of where they die, she said. Valeriya Nakshun, whose family fled Dagestan to the United States during Russia's wars in neighboring Chechnya in the 1990s, said her ancestors considered themselves semi-Indigenous to the region because they came from Persia and the Levant centuries ago. She still has relatives in Makhachkala and Derbent, including her maternal grandmother. \u201cThey are still in shock after the attack and are still processing it,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though the synagogue is burned, they are grateful they are safe.\u201d Her father, Boris Nakshun, grew up in Dagestan when it was part of the Soviet Union, at a time when Jews, Muslims and Christians were not allowed to practice their faith openly. Rituals such as circumcisions and weddings had to be done in secret and the relationship between all communities was largely cordial, he said. While Dagestani Jews celebrate the same holidays as other Jews, the traditions and foods are different. For Passover, Nakshun's family cooks a rice dish with dried fruit and a thick crust at the bottom of the pot, herb stew and egg drop soup. On Yom Kippur, they light a candle on two separate trays, representing the living and the dead. \u201cIt\u2019s like remembering your ancestors, but also praying for the living,\u201d Nakshun said. The language of Dagestani Jews is known as Juhuri, a branch of the Tat dialect of Persian spoken by the local Muslims, said Ronald Shabtaev, a linguist and doctoral student at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. Juhuri is spoken only by Jews, and has several dialects, he said. \u201cJuhuri has not isolated the Caucasus Jews from the rest of the Jewish world,\u201d Shabtaev said. \u201cOn the contrary, it has helped preserve Jewish heritage and tradition and maintain Mountain Jewish ethnoreligious identity.\u201d Juhuri, which has a rich vocabulary with Hebrew and Aramaic words, is an endangered language \u2014 spoken or understood by fewer than 200,000 people worldwide, including 30,000 in the United States, he said. Several Nakshun family members, including Valeriya Nakshun's father and 96-year-old paternal grandmother, are among them. The relationship between Jews and Muslims in Dagestan has been historically \u201clayered,\u201d but largely friendly, Redmond said. She saw people of different faiths greet their neighbors on the street and invite each other for tea. \u201cThere is a high level of knowledge about each other's religions, holidays and food habits,\u201d she said. But that has not ruled out tensions, including during the Chechen wars and the more recent increase in extremism, fueled in online spaces, Redmond said. Rabbi Lazar said a majority of the Muslim population in Dagestan still has a good relationship with Jews and shares the dismay over Sunday\u2019s attacks. \u201cThis was not just an attack on Jews, but also on churches, the state and all people,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Muslims in Dagestan are also worried about this new wave of extremism. But we know that this is coming from outside the country and a very small percentage of Muslims are influenced by such ideology.\u201d He estimates that after an exodus of Jewish people during the Chechen wars, there are only about 500 families left in Derbent and about 200 in Makachkhala. Lazar said he has not spoken with President Vladimir Putin after the attack, but is hopeful that Dagestan, including its Jewish community, will receive protection from the state. Nakshun and her father are not too optimistic. \u201cI don\u2019t think Putin cares about what happens in Dagestan or even understands what is happening there,\u201d said Boris Nakshun, adding that the region is largely disregarded by Moscow, and that he continues to worry about family and community members who are left behind. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

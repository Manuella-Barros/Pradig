Russian military bloggers estimated 20 or more Wagner personnel had been killed.\n\nThe CSP said it had killed and injured dozens of Malians and Russians, while an Islamist group affiliated with al Qaeda said it had killed 50 Russians and 10 Malian soldiers.\n\nMali, Burkina Faso and Niger, all former Western allies that have pivoted towards Russia since their militaries took power in coups, signed a mutual defence pact last year, which Mali invoked to explain Burkina Faso's role in the air strikes.\n\nThe Tuareg live in the Sahara desert, which includes parts of northern Mali. Many complain of marginalisation by the Malian government.\n\nTuareg separatists launched an insurgency against Mali in 2012, demanding an independent homeland called Azawad. Their struggle later became entangled with an al Qaeda-aligned Islamist rebellion in the same region.\n\n(Additional reporting by Sofia Christensen; Writing by Portia Crowe; Editing by Estelle Shirbon

Mali's army and the Russian private military company Wagner both said they had suffered losses between July 22 and 27 in the Tinzaouaten area, on the border with Algeria, in what appears to be Wagner's worst setback on African soil.\n\nThe Russians have been in Mali since the army, which seized power in two coups in 2020 and 2021, kicked out French and U.N. troops that had been involved in fighting Islamist insurgents for a decade, replacing them with Wagner.\n\nThe Malian army said late on Tuesday that it had attacked what it called a \"coalition of terrorists\" in the Tinzaouaten area jointly with forces from its neighbour Burkina Faso, which is also run by a pro-Russian military junta.\n\n\"Specific high-value targets including caches, logistical positions and vehicles have been hit,\" it said, urging civilians to stay away from insurgent positions.\n\nThe Tuareg rebel group that was involved in the earlier fighting, known as the Permanent Strategic Framework or CSP, its acronym in French, condemned the air strikes and said a drone operated by Burkina Faso had killed dozens of civilians.\n\nIt said the dead were mostly African migrant labourers, including from Niger, Chad and Sudan, who were working in local artisanal gold mines.\n\n\"This attack against civilians demonstrates the ongoing chaos and failure of these military governments,\" it said in a statement.\n\nBurkina Faso's military government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNeither Mali nor Wagner have said how many troops they lost in the recent clashes, though Wagner did say the commander of its unit in the area, Sergei Shevchenko, was among the dead. Russian military bloggers estimated 20 or more Wagner personnel had been killed.\n\nThe CSP said it had killed and injured dozens of Malians and Russians, while an Islamist group affiliated with al Qaeda said it had killed 50 Russians and 10 Malian soldiers.\n\nMali, Burkina Faso and Niger, all former Western allies that have pivoted towards Russia since their militaries took power in coups, signed a mutual defence pact last year, which Mali invoked to explain Burkina Faso's role in the air strikes.\n\nThe Tuareg live in the Sahara desert, which includes parts of northern Mali. Many complain of marginalisation by the Malian government.\n\nTuareg separatists launched an insurgency against Mali in 2012, demanding an independent homeland called Azawad. Their struggle later became entangled with an al Qaeda-aligned Islamist rebellion in the same region.

Some 1,000 militants belonging to the Coordination of Azawad Movements group as well as from al-Qaeda, both banned in Russia, have attacked Russian fighters near Tinzaouaten in Mali, the Wagner group said in a statement.\n\n\"On the first day, the group destroyed most of the Islamists and forced the rest to retreat. However, a sandstorm which occurred later allowed the radicals to regroup and increase their numbers to 1,000 people. In this regard, the command of the Wagner Private Military Company (PMC) decided to transfer additional forces to the area of combat operations to assist the 13th assault squad,\" the group said in a statement on its Telegram channel.\n\nAccording to it, on July 25, the militants attacked again, \"but thanks to the coordinated actions of storm troopers and Malian servicemen, the attempted attack was repelled.\" \"Over the next two days, radicals have stepped up the number of massive attacks, using heavy weapons, drones and car bombs, which caused losses on the part of the Wagner PMC and the Malian armed forces,\" the statement said.\n\nThe group pointed out that the last radiogram of the attackers, sent in the evening on July 27, reported that only three Russian fighters remained alive; they continue to fight. It is also specified that the commander of the 13th assault squad Sergey Shevchenko was killed in action.\n\nOn July 26, armed militants attacked a patrol of government troops in the area of Tinzaouaten (northeast Mali, on the border with Algeria). According to the Malian authorities, two servicemen were killed and 10 others were wounded. In turn, the security forces managed to eliminate about 20 terrorists, destroy their vehicles and equipment.\n\nAccording to a communique released by the General Staff of the Malian Armed Forces, the country's servicemen are engaged in fierce battles with terrorist groups in the area of Tinzaouaten. The document said that the zone where the clashes are taking place \"is teeming with terrorists and smugglers of all kinds.\" The General Staff also called on civilians to leave the areas where terrorists are located to avoid casualties.\n\nThe armed conflict between the Malian authorities and extremist and separatist groups began in 2012.

Individual representatives of the Ukrainian special services are on the ground in Mali, giving support to terrorist and jihadist groups, Viktor Vasilyev, an African affairs specialist and spin doctor, currently on assignment in that country, has told TASS. According to his sources, Ukrainian specialists help the militant groups learn to operate and use unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\n\"At the moment, according to my sources, it is true that, let's say, individual representatives of Ukraine's secret services are present here.

According to the authorities of Mali, two government soldiers were killed and 10 others wounded. In turn, the government forces managed to eliminate about 20 terrorists and destroy their vehicles and equipment.\n\nIn a statement of the Russian assault squads uploaded to the official Telegram channel of the group PMC Wagner, it was noted that a group of militants from the Coordination of the Azawad Movements and the group Al-Qaeda in the Sahel Region, banned in Russia, which attacked the Russian assault squad in the vicinity of Tinzaouaten in Mali, numbered up to 1,000 men.\n\nAccording to a communique released by Mali's General Staff the Armed Forces are engaged in fierce battles with terrorist detachments in the area of Tinzaouaten. The communique notes that the zone where the clashes are in progress \"remains a citadel of terrorists and smugglers of all sorts.\" The General Staff called on civilians to leave the terrorists-held areas to avoid casualties.\n\nThe armed conflict between the Malian authorities and extremist and separatist groups began in 2012.

Vassiliev, speaking to TASS, reported from his sources that these Ukrainian operatives are not only involved in commissioning drones but also assisting in their use during conflicts. The expert's assertions add a complex layer to the ongoing security challenges in the region, where drone technology has increasingly become a part of warfare tactics, marking a significant escalation in capabilities for terrorist groups.\n\nVassiliev also touched on the local response to foreign military presence, noting a generally positive reception towards Russian instructors in Mali. This sentiment was particularly evident following the capture of Kidal, a separatist stronghold in the northeast, where public celebrations ensued.\n\nThe backdrop to these allegations is a tense security situation marked by a recent attack on July 26 near Tin Zaouatine in northeastern Mali, close to the Algerian border. Malian authorities reported that this assault by armed rebels resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and injuries to ten others. In retaliation, Malian security forces claimed to have eliminated around twenty terrorists, underscoring the volatile state of the region.\n\nFurther complicating the security landscape is the involvement of Russian private military contractors from the Wagner group, who reported via Telegram that up to 1,000 fighters from the Coordination of Azawad Movements and the Support Group for Islam and Muslims, linked to Al-Qaeda, engaged in combat with Russian forces near Tin Zaouatine.\n\nMali has been embroiled in conflict with extremist and separatist groups since 2012, leading to a protracted crisis impacting both security and socio-economic conditions in the country.", "source": {"uri": "africanewswire.za.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Africa News Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kidal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_Zaouatine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tin Zaouatine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_of_Azawad_Movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coordination of Azawad Movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wagner Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private military company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://africanewswire.za.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-anw-logo2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778878", "eventUri": "eng-9778878", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1177, "textEnd": 1184}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

that killed at least 50 mercenaries from Russia's Wagner mercenary group and 10 Malian troops, dealing a severe blow to Moscow's military operations in the area.\n\nSITE, a United States-based counterterrorism consultancy group, said on Tuesday that the attack occurred while Russian and Malian troops were already retreating from the border town of Tinzaouaten near Algeria after suffering heavy losses to forces with an armed Tuareg rebel movement.\n\nThe group, which is based in Mali's northern Sahara region and calls itself the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security, and Development (CSP-PSD), has been waging an active insurgency against the Malian government since 2012.\n\nCSP-PSD claimed earlier this week that it had killed dozens of Wagner and Malian forces after days of heavy fighting.\n\nDuring the retreat, an African branch of al Qaeda known as Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin reportedly took advantage of rough weather conditions, including sandstorms, to launch a second surprise ambush.\n\nThe Malian army, which seized power in a series of coups from 2020 to 2021, claimed that it had deployed forces as part of a \"stabilization operation\" in rebel-held territory on July 19 and eventually went on the offensive on July 25.\n\nIn a rare statement released Monday, Wagner confirmed that its forces, while fighting alongside Malian troops, suffered heavy losses, even losing battle-hardened commander Sergei Shevchenko in the fighting.", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors":

Though video images posted on social media show the wreckage of combat vehicles and dozens of Russians killed in action after the battle had ended, there is less clarity about how the fighting leading up to these scenes unfolded. While some reports suggest that Tuareg separatists initially intercepted the convoy, other video clips indicate that jihadist insurgents linked to the al-Qaida-affiliated JNIM movement wiped out the Russian and Malian forces that survived the initial round of fighting.\n\nWith Tuareg separatists as well as jihadists trying to claim credit for the attack, its long-term political impact will depend heavily on which faction moves more quickly to seize territory that an overstretched Malian government will no longer be able to secure.", "source": {"uri": "worldpoliticsreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Politics Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_clarkson@worldpoliticsreview.com", "name": "Alexander Clarkson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ambush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sahel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinzaouaten", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tinzaouaten"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wagner Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jama'at_Nasr_al-Islam_wal_Muslimin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Mali", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Mali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuareg people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killed_in_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killed in action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mali-russia-wagner-security-07312024-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778878", "eventUri": "eng-9778878", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "dateEnd": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 543, "textEnd": 557}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

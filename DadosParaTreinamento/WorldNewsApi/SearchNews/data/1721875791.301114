Nicole Virzi, a fifth year Ph.D. candidate at the San Diego State University/UC San Diego Joint Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, is also accused of physically abusing the dead baby\u2019s twin, according to reports. Six-week-old Leon Katz, the son of Ethan Katz and his wife Savannah Roberts, died on Father\u2019s Day as Virzi was caring for him in the family\u2019s Pittsburgh home, authorities said. Virzi and Roberts were doctoral students at different universities \u2014 Roberts was studying at the University of Pittsburgh \u2014 but both were focused on eating disorders, trauma and body image. The couple left Leon in Virzi\u2019s care while rushing Ari to the hospital with a mysterious injury to his genitals, which Virzi had alerted them to, authorities said. While the first-time parents were caring for Ari, Virzi claimed Leon fell from his bouncer chair while she stepped away to get a bottle, according to police and court records. But doctors found the injuries \u201cconsistent with having been sustained as a result of child abuse, as these are inflicted injuries that are not natural and not accidental,\u201d according to WTAE. Virzi was referred to as a \u201ctrusted family friend\u201d in the GoFundMe established to help the grieving parents and their surviving son. Virzi had been staying in a nearby Airbnb on South Graham Street in the hipster Shadyside neighborhood when she was asked to care for the baby, who was \u201calert, conscious and not injured,\u201d according to a criminal complaint obtained by by Pittsburgh\u2019s TRIBLive. It was not clear why Virzi was in Pittsburgh, but there were traces of the friendship between the two women online. Virzi\u2019s X account is now protected, making her messages inaccessible. But Roberts made reference to her at least twice, once in Jan. 2022 where she referred to Virzi\u2019s \u201cincredible work\u201d and once in May 2021 when she wrote a post to Virzi saying: \u201cYou are going to do an AMAZING job! I can\u2019t wait to hear about your experience.\u201d Cops arrived Walnut Street home after Virzi called 911 at 11:17 p.m. June 15, authorities said in the complaint. Virzi said the baby had suffered a bump to his head. Virzi told cops she started babysitting Leon at about 6:30 p.m. that night, and claimed he was doing fine, eaten, had soiled two diapers and had been burped, according to the complaint. She fell asleep \u201cfor a period of time while Leon was in the bouncer seat,\u201d Virzi claimed. When Virzi awoke, she said, she went to the kitchen to get a bottle for Leon, and heard the baby screaming. Virzi contended she found Leon lying on the floor, picked him up, and saw \u201ca large bump to the left side of Leon\u2019s head,\u201d prosecutors said in the court document. Paramedics rushed Leon to the hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead at 5:47 a.m. on Father\u2019s Day, police said. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office ruled the death a homicide. Leon\u2019s cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. A head CT scan showed Leon suffered a severe skull fracture to the left side of the head, along with multiple brain bleeds. Virzi, a graduate of Pepperdine University who holds a graduate degree in clinical psychology from San Diego State, grew up in the tristate area, the daughter of Dr. Peter J. Virzi, a highly-respected cardiologist affiliated with Mt. Sinai Doctors in Manhattan. \u201cI have no words,\u201d a friend and colleague of Virzi\u2019s told The Post Saturday. \u201cI am absolutely shocked. I had no idea.\u201d The friend said she did not know Virzi to be violent but said noted she \u201chad some interpersonal issues. I would say she was a little rigid. She was nice. But very driven and motivated.\u201d A man who identified himself as the suspect\u2019s father hung up when The Post called. Virzi was charged June 16 with criminal homicide, three counts of aggravated assault, and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Virzi is currently being held without bail at the Allegheny County Jail. Virzi\u2019s attorney David Shrager told The Post Saturday his client was innocent, and planned to plead not guilty. \u201cShe is obviously devastated,\u201d Shrager said. \u201cShe\u2019s highly distraught and deeply sad. She said it was nothing intentional. We\u2019re doing a deep investigation. She has no criminal history. We will do our best to give her a fair hearing in court. This is a case with a dead child and a young lady in jail. It should not be speculated on before the case goes to court.\u201d Virzi\u2019s professional bio says her \u201cresearch aims to explore the complex interplay between psychological factors\u2014such as depression, stress, negative affect, and trauma\u2014 and critical health outcomes and behaviors\u2014 such as metabolic syndrome, heart disease, obesity, eating behavior, and exercise.\u201d \u201cI am particularly interested in exploring these relationships within female and trauma-exposed populations,\u201d she added. \u201cBy concentrating on these relationships, my research aims to shed light on the unique challenges and opportunities for intervention within these vulnerable groups.\u201d She was also reportedly an instructor at the Cyclebar Carmel Valley in San Diego.

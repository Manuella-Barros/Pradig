{"id": 231292830, "title": "Paloma Faith lashes out at BBC viewer after cruel backlash over Saturday Kitchen interview", "text": "Paloma Faith has lashed out at a Saturday Kitchen viewer over her interview comments. The singer was promoting her forthcoming record The Glorification of Sadness when a viewer criticised her appearance. The annoyed viewer wrote: \"People who are just mind numbingly annoying t***s always use ADHD for the reason why they are mind numbingly annoying t***s.\" However, Paloma didn't hold back as she quickly clapped back at the rude comment. She wrote: \"I have actually got ADHD you t**t.\" Fans loved that the singer spoke her mind, with many back her up. One replied: \"I used to really like you, now I bloody love you,\" with another saying: \"You tell him, Paloma!!\" ADHD, which stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is a condition that affects people's behaviour. Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder include a short attention span, constantly fidgeting and acting without thinking. Paloma's comment comes soon after she was forced to cancel an upcoming performance by medical professionals after being diagnosed with laryngitis. Laryngitis often affects singers as it is inflammation of the voice box, caused by overuse, irritation or infection. The NHS states that symptoms include difficulty speaking, a sore throat, mild fever and cough. The 42-year-old explained she was \"devastated\" to cancel her concert in Cardiff but had done everything in her power to try and get back on stage. She told fans: \"I am devastated to announce I have been advised by medical professionals not to perform my Cardiff show tomorrow but to reschedule. I am doing vocal rest, steaming, gargling and I even had a steroid injection.\" Paloma continued: \"At the moment it's one day at a time so will let you know tomorrow about Brighton but I don't want to do anything more than I want to do these shows and know that when you do come they will be the best show I can do for you. So far this tour has been incredible and I am dying to get on with it! \"This is the worst thing to have to do and I can't apologise enough... Weirdly the kids are behaving better now I can't speak, which is confusing me. Please hang on to your tickets and as soon as my team have a date to reschedule to we will let you know.\" Speaking previously to the Mirror, the singer couldn't help but share her excitement about her tour. She said: \"It's my favourite thing to do. It's the reason why I do this job, being on stage, connecting with people who are there to see me and sing my songs with me. \"It's just the most privileged situation to be in and the only time I'm not anxious, weirdly. I find life quite overwhelming, daily life, on stage, I never feel overwhelmed, I feel like I'm in my right place, I'm really looking forward to it.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads.", "summary": "Paloma Faith, who recently had to cancel an upcoming performance by medical professionals after being diagnosed with laryngitis, joined BBC Saturday Kitchen this weekend", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/paloma-faith-lashes-out-bbc-32988900", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32988953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PalomaJPG.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:58:54", "author": "Charlotte Everett,Charlotte-Everett", "authors": ["Charlotte Everett", "Charlotte-Everett"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.501}

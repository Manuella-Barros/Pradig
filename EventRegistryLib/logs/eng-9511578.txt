Around 50 people were taking part in the event at the Moment theatre in Gubb\u00e4ngen, a southern suburb of the Swedish capital, organised by the Left Party and the Green Party. \"Three people were taken by ambulance to hospital,\" the police said on its website, shortly after the attack.\n\nAccording to Swedish media, one person was physically assaulted and two had paint sprayed in their faces. \"The Nazis attacked visitors using physical violence, with pepper spray, and vandalised the venue before throwing in some kind of smoke grenade which filled the foyer with smoke,\" Expo wrote on its website. The magazine's head of education Klara Ljungberg was at the event in order to hold a lecture at the invitation of the two political parties.\n\nWhat was the meeting about?\n\nAccording to the Left Party's press officer, the event was \"a meeting about growing fascism\". Left Party leader Nooshi Dadgostar described the event to public broadcaster SVT as an \"open event, for equality among individuals\". As well as Ljungberg from Expo, panelists at the event included anti-fascist activist Mathias W\u00e5g, who also writes for Swedish centre-left tabloid Aftonbladet. \"They were determined and went straight for me,\" W\u00e5g told Expo just after the attack. \"I received a few blows but nothing that caused serious damage.\" \"I was invited to be on a panel in order to discuss anti-fascism with representatives from the Left Party and the Green Party,\" he told the magazine. \"I didn't know this was going to happen, but there's obviously a risk when Expo and I are in the same place.\"\n\nWhat has the reaction been like?\n\nAll of Sweden's parties across the political spectrum have denounced the attack, with Dadgostar describing it as a \"threat to our democracy\" when TT newswire interviewed her at the theatre a few hours after the attack occurred. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, from the conservative Moderates, called the attack \"abhorrent\". The Moderates, Christian Democrats and Liberals are currently in government with the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, while the Social Democrats, Left Party, Centre Party and Green Party are in opposition. \"It is appalling news that a meeting hosted by the Left Party has been stormed,\" Kristersson told TT. \"I have reached out to Nooshi Dadgostar and expressed my deepest support.

She told public broadcaster SVT that an \"open event, for equality among individuals\" was \"violently attacked by those who seemed to be Nazis\", calling on \"all political forces\" to fight the \"far right that threatens our democracy\".\n\nPrime Minister Ulf Kristersson, of the conservative Moderate Party, said he had reached out to Dadgostar to express his support.\n\n\"It's terrible that a meeting organised by the Left Party has been attacked,\" he told the TT news agency. \"This type of hateful behaviour has no place in our free and open society.\"\n\n\"My thoughts are with the people affected. Right-wing extremists want to frighten us into silence. They must never succeed,\" wrote centre-left Social Democrat leader Magdalena Andersson on X.\n\nJimmie \u00c5kesson, the leader of the far-right Sweden Democrats, told TT that \"politically motivated violence is terrible in all forms, and does not belong in Sweden\". He urged \"all democratic forces to, in full unity, stand up against all kinds of politically motivated violence\".\n\nSwedish vocabulary: to condemn - att f\u00f6rd\u00f6ma\n\nSweden's controversial stop-and-search zones come into force\n\nA controversial law enabling police to introduce stop-and-search zones came into effect today.\n\nThe law means that police are able to designate a certain area a \"security zone\" if there is \"significant\" risk of a conflict between criminal gangs involving shootings or explosions, and the zone is considered to be of \"extraordinary\" importance to stem the tide of violence.\n\n\"These are strong legal terms, and in other words nothing that will be taken lightly and happen everywhere,\" Kristian Malzoff, a police officer who was involved in developing the police authority's guidance on how to put the new law into practice, told TT.\n\nHe said most people in these areas won't be searched. At the time of writing, no area had yet been designated a stop-and-search zone.\n\nThe zones can be introduced for a maximum of two weeks at a time, and means that police are allowed to stop adults or children, or search vehicles, without there being a concrete suspicion that a crime has been committed. But it's not supposed to be used to carry out random searches, so there needs to be a reason such as the person behaving in an odd way, who they're in contact with, or intelligence reports.\n\nConcerns have been raised that it opens the door to discrimination. At the moment it is not possible for a person who is stopped by police and feels that they were discriminated against on, for example, racial grounds to report it to Sweden's Discrimination Ombudsman. That's because police work is not covered by Sweden's laws on discrimination, although legislation is in the pipeline which may change that.\n\nSwedish vocabulary: security zones - s\u00e4kerhetszoner (more commonly referred to as visitationszoner)\n\nSwedish healthcare strike threatening to break out at 4pm\n\nA healthcare strike is set to break out at 4pm on Thursday unless the parties reach an agreement at the eleventh hour.\n\nA strike would potentially see 63,000 members of the Swedish Association of Health Professionals, a healthcare union representing nurses, midwives, biomedical scientists and radiographers, refusing to work overtime unless their demands on salary and schedules are met.\n\nBut negotiations with SKR, the umbrella organisation for Swedish regions, and employer organisation Sobona have not yet brought the parties closer together. Late on Wednesday the union and SKR and Sobona again rejected each other's bids and counter proposals.\n\nThe union said earlier this month that the workers they represent in total worked 3 million hours in overtime last year.", "source": {"uri": "thelocal.se", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Local"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_l@thelocal.se", "name": "Emma L", "type": "author", "isAgency":

stormed a theatre in Stockholm that was hosting an anti-fascist event and set off smoke bombs that injured several attendees, according to Swedish police.\n\n\"A group of Nazis\" came into the theatre just before the event was scheduled to start late Wednesday and attacked visitors and threw smoke grenades into the hall, according to the anti-racist foundation and watchdog, Expo.\n\nAt least 50 people attended the event which was organized by the Left Party and Green Party at the Gubbangen theatre in a southern suburb of Stockholm.\n\n\"The Nazis attacked visitors using physical violence\u00e2\u20ac| vandalised the premises before throwing a type of smoke bomb that filled the entrance hall with smoke,\" Expo wrote on its website.\n\nSeveral people were taken to hospital by ambulance for checks after inhaling smoke as the rescue service and the police rushed to the scene.\n\n\"Three people were taken by ambulance to hospital,\" said a police statement.\n\nThe attack was condemned by all political parties, including Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.\n\n\"It's terrible that a meeting organised by the left-wing party has been attacked,\" Kristersson, was \"ed by the TT news agency.\n\nThe prime minister called it an attack on Sweden's democracy, adding that the incident had no place in the country, it said.\n\n\"This type of hateful behaviour has no place in our free and open society.\n\n\"An attack on a democratic meeting is an attack on our entire democracy,\" he said.\n\nNo arrests have been made, however, police spokesperson Ola Osterling told national broadcaster SVT that an investigation is going well and officials have very good footage.\n\nEarlier this month another group of masked men from the Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement (NMR) attacked an EU migrant camp in northern Stockholm.\n\nNMR took responsibility for the attack in a video published by the group.\n\nThe Nazi group has written about the attack and published pictures and a video in which they are seen tearing down the camp calling it a \"clean-up operation.\" -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

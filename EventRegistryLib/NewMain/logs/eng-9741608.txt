Iran's incoming president, Masoud Pezeshkian also believes a new world order is emerging, one in which U.S. power is declining but remains significant.\n\nPezeshkian outlined his views in a recent article in the English-language Tehran Times. In it, he defended Iran's decision to strengthen ties with Russia and China as well as neighboring countries and the Global South, but also said his administration's foreign policy would be \"balanced\" and \"include \"constructive engagement\" with the West.\n\n\"My administration will pursue an opportunity-driven policy by creating balance in relations with all countries, consistent with our national interests, economic development, and requirements of regional and global peace and security,\" he wrote. \"Accordingly, we will welcome sincere efforts to alleviate tensions and will reciprocate good-faith with good-faith.\"\n\nPezeshkian's views are a slightly softer version of those of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to whom any Iranian president is subservient on matters of national security. Khamenei sees the international order as based on three axes of global power. The first -- the liberal order of institutions and norms created after World War II -- is weakening in Khamenei's view because American hegemony is declining. A second axis, formed by Russia and China, is seen as rising. The third axis joins Iran with this rising new world order under a policy of \"look to the East,\" and abandons the slogan of \"Neither East, nor West\" dominant after the 1979 revolution.\n\nThe vision allows for reducing tensions with the West but \"mainly the view should be towards the East; Looking towards the West and Europe has no effect for us except to cause problems and humiliation,\" Khamenei says. \"We must look towards the East; there are countries that can help us.\"\n\nThis view was strongly reflected by the administration of Ebrahim Raisi, whose death in a helicopter crash in May led to new presidential elections. A so-called Transformation Document of the Raisi government includes efforts to resolve Iran's nuclear dispute with the West but not as a platform to improve relations. North America was not even mentioned as a region with which Iran can have relations.\n\nAccording to Pezeshkian, power has shifted from West to East, and America's role has declined, but new poles have not been established. This view mirrors that of influential former foreign ministers Mohammad Javad Zarif and Ali Akbar Salehi, key advisors to the new president. Zarif has written that the rigid bipolar order of the past is gone and that the world system is in a transition stage. Failure to appreciate the fact that a new order has not yet been created could be dangerous for Iran's national interests, Zarif believes. \"It is dangerous for Iran to be anti-Russian and anti-American,\" Zarif says. \"Because we have to prioritize our national interests and then consider opposition to American domination.\" Zarif adds: \"Iran should not wait for the emergence of new poles, but any great and effective power can emerge in a specific area.\"\n\nSalehi, a nuclear physicist who with Zarif was a key negotiator of the 2015 nuclear agreement, believes that if Iran clings to Russia, China, or America, it will be a disaster; Instead, Iran must stand in the middle of this triangle.\n\nBecause the new order does not have an inflexible polar nature, being too close to one power cannot assure Iran's interests, in Salehi's view. Because, for example, the nature and logic of China's competition with the United States is not irreconcilable everywhere, so Iran's desired interests cannot be secured by only being close to China.\n\nPezeshkian has stated that the foreign policy of his government will be neither anti-East nor anti-West. He pays special attention to the Global South: \"Recognizing that the global landscape has evolved beyond traditional dynamics, my administration is committed to fostering mutually beneficial relations with emerging international players in the Global South, especially with African nations,\" he wrote. \"We will strive to enhance our collaborative efforts and strengthen our partnerships for the mutual benefit of all involved.\"\n\nAs to the relationship with Russia and China, Pezeshkian writes that both countries \"have consistently stood by us during challenging times. We deeply value this friendship. Our 25-year roadmap with China represents a significant milestone towards establishing a mutually beneficial comprehensive strategic partnership,' and we look forward to collaborating more extensively with Beijing as we advance towards a new global order.\" Pezeshkian also noted China's role in facilitating Iran-Saudi normalization in 2023.\n\nHis approach to the West is two-fold. Regarding Europe, he criticizes its failure to compensate Iran for the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement but expresses his desire for constructive dialogue. He is tougher on the U.S., calling on Washington to change its approach and not stressing a desire for talks. Iran's caution is the result of U.S. actions, he says, such as quitting the nuclear deal and putting Iran on an \"Axis of Evil\" in spite of its cooperation against the Taliban in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nAt the same time, Pezeshkian understands that he cannot fulfill campaign promises to improve the Iranian economy without obtaining relief of U.S. sanctions and getting off the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global watchdog against terrorism financing and money laundering. Ties with Russia and China and membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and the Eurasian Economic Union cannot make up for sanctions.\n\nIran's \"Look to the East\" policy also fails to insure that Russia and China always support Iran in the U.N. Security Council or defy U.S. unilateral sanctions to invest in Iran.\n\nIn general, Pezeshkian's approach is practical and pragmatic. It recalls the foreign policy of the Hashemi Rafsanjani government, which sought to reconstruct Iran after the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Like Rafsanjani's successor, Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian seeks to present a more constructive image of Iran at the regional and global level. Like Hassan Rouhani, the president before Raisi, the new president seeks sanctions relief that will improve Iranians' daily lives.", "source": {"uri": "stimson.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Iran is still part of the agreement but it has decreased its commitments due to US sanctions imposed on it.\n\nNewsweek said: \"On the foreign policy front, he (Bagheri Kani) said that Tehran remained open to resuming negotiations with Washington toward restoring mutual participation in a nuclear deal.\"\n\nHowever, Iran also intended to foster its deepening ties with China, Russia and neighboring nations, it quoted him as saying. Iran will also call for greater action against Israel in view of the Gaza war, he said.\n\nThe Biden administration said last week the United States was not ready to resume nuclear talks with Iran under its new president. With the election of Masoud Pezeshkian earlier in July, some speculated that Tehran intended to hold more serious talks with Washington, but so far the new president has signaled the continuation of Iran's regional policies of projecting power.\n\nBagheri-Kani became the acting foreign minister after foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian died in a helicopter crash along with Iran's president Ebrahim Raisi in May.

His election campaign was marked by significant promises related to foreign policy, aimed at shifting the dynamics of Iran's international relations. Central to his agenda was the pledge to reengage with the nuclear deal and improve diplomatic ties with the West, including the US. But whether Pezeshkian will be able to achieve these objectives is a matter of considerable debate. The complexities of Iran's political landscape pose significant challenges to the realization of his foreign policy goals.\n\nOne of Pezeshkian's primary foreign policy promises has been a return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear agreement, which was signed in 2015 but fell by the wayside after the US withdrew in 2018. He views it as essential for Iran's reintegration into the global community. Additionally, he aims to mend and improve relations with Western nations, including the US. However, the feasibility of these promises is contingent on the political will within Iran and the reaction of the international community.\n\nThe main objective behind Pezeshkian's goals is to lift the sanctions that have long crippled Iran's economy . Sanctions relief is seen as a gateway to numerous benefits, including the full reintegration of the Islamic Republic into the global financial system. Such a reintegration would increase Iran's global legitimacy, allowing it to engage more freely in international trade and investment. In addition, lifting sanctions would significantly boost Iran's revenues.\n\nHowever, Iran's advancements in its nuclear program have raised serious concerns both regionally and globally. The International Atomic Energy Agency last month issued a stark warning after its inspectors confirmed that Iran had begun feeding uranium gas into advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility, marking a significant escalation in its enrichment capabilities. These advanced centrifuges enhance the efficiency of uranium enrichment by spinning the uranium gas at exceptionally high speeds.\n\nThis process allows Iran to enrich uranium to higher levels more quickly, drastically reducing the time required to produce nuclear weapons. Iran has acknowledged enriching uranium to 84 percent, which is perilously close to the 90 percent threshold needed for weapons-grade material. This development has heightened fears of a potential nuclear arms race in the region.\n\nThe Biden administration is under considerable pressure, particularly from Republicans, to take decisive action to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. This pressure is not solely a matter of foreign policy but also a significant domestic political issue, with various stakeholders influencing the administration's approach.\n\nIt is worth noting that, while the nuclear deal involves multiple countries -- France, Germany, the UK, Russia, China and the US -- the most crucial players in reaching a deal are Tehran and Washington. Historical precedents, such as the agreement reached by the Obama administration with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, demonstrate that political will in both countries is essential for any agreement. However, the current political climates in Iran and the US present formidable obstacles to reviving the deal, despite any mutual interests that may exist.\n\nIn spite of Pezeshkian's expressed desire to return to the nuclear deal and the Biden administration's long-standing support for its revival, the prevailing pressure in both Washington and Tehran opposes such an outcome. Trust between the two governments is at an all-time low. In Washington, the opposition comes mainly from Republicans, who argue that Iran cannot be trusted to comply with any agreement and that sanctions should be maintained or even intensified to curb its regional ambitions. Meanwhile, in Iran, hard-liners, including the senior cadre of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, oppose reengaging with the US. They view the nuclear deal as a potential threat to their ideological and political interests.\n\nThis entrenched opposition on both sides creates a challenging environment for any diplomatic breakthrough.\n\nIran's advancements in its nuclear program have raised serious concerns both regionally and globally.\n\nDr. Majid Rafizadeh\n\nFurthermore, the socioeconomic and political conditions have changed since the Rouhani administration. Previously, sanctions were severely affecting Iran, creating an appetite for a nuclear deal. Today, the sanctions are less impactful, diminishing the motivation for a new agreement. During Rouhani's tenure, the economic strain from sanctions had reached a tipping point, compelling the Iranian leadership to seek relief through diplomacy. However, the Iranian leadership today perceives that the impact of sanctions has been mitigated through various means, reducing the urgency for a deal.\n\nAdditionally, Iran's ongoing tensions with Israel have shifted priorities, with a focus on maintaining a strong defensive posture rather than pursuing diplomatic avenues. This change in the internal and external landscapes complicates the possibility of a renewed nuclear agreement under Pezeshkian's leadership.\n\nWhen discussing improved relations between Iran and the West, it is essential to distinguish between the EU and the US. While better ties with the EU are feasible, improving relations with Washington seems highly unlikely as long as Khamenei remains in power. Opposition to the US is a fundamental principle of the Islamic Republic, rooted in ideological commitments. The EU, on the other hand, has been more open to engagement with Iran, focusing on economic and diplomatic ties that could benefit both sides.\n\nIn conclusion, despite Pezeshkian's promises, better ties with the US and the revival of the nuclear deal are extremely unlikely. The deep-seated mistrust between the two nations, coupled with the internal political dynamics in both Tehran and Washington, creates a formidable barrier to any meaningful diplomatic progress. As such, the prospects for a major shift in US-Iran relations under Pezeshkian's presidency remain bleak.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [],

I would have made a great deal with them -- no nuclear weapons,\" Trump said. \"I saw what was happening, they were on the path to a nuclear weapon.

They didn't have any money for Hamas ... they had no money for Hezbollah,\" Trump told Bloomberg.\n\nAzadeh Eftekhari, a political analyst and managing editor at Independent Persian, told DW that a second trump administration will be dealing with a Islamic Republic under different conditions.\n\n\"Today, there are two significant wars: the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war, which now also involves Hezbollah, one of the Islamic Republic's arms in the region. Iran's nuclear program has also seen significant development under the Biden administration,\" she said.\n\nTrump's running mate, JD Vance, recently criticized Biden's policy, adding that Trump had prevented Iran from accessing money and \"controlled\" the behavior of the Iranian regime.\n\nVance also criticized the Biden administration's strikes against the Houthis in Yemen and Iranian proxies in Iraq as \"weak little bombing runs.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio, who has appeared with Trump on the campaign trial, said at the Republican National Convention (RNC) that \"the Islamic Republic was bankrupt during Trump's time, but under Biden, it has money to support terrorism.\"\n\nTrump told the convention that Iran is \"on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\"The nuclear issue will be one of the main issues between the Islamic Republic and a potential Trump administration,\" Eftekhari said.\n\n\"An increase in pressures and the imposition of sanctions, which had been almost suspended under the Biden administration, is foreseeable,\" she added.\n\nTrump also targeted Iranian interests with force during his administration.\n\nIn April 2019, Trump designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization.

Even though opinions on the role of the United States in the international community and the strength of its general influence often differ among analysts, the foreign policy trajectory pursued by the American president remains the most influential catalyst for the unfolding of events in international affairs. It is precisely for this reason why the November election, regardless of who eventually contests it and wins, is another historic opportunity for the US to either consolidate or redefine the course of its foreign policy and global outlook. The current international system is characterized by significant hostility, with more than just one armed conflict threatening to escalate into something more dangerous for international peace. The gravity of this situation is arguably reinforced most forcefully by the fact that the current system, with multilateralism and nuclear deterrence at the core, had been designed following the Second World War to prevent a scenario like the one observed today from being a possibility.\n\nAlthough the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas tends to dominate global media headlines, relations between the 'West' (primarily the US) and Iran play a sometimes understated but highly significant role in shaping the current international security landscape. The 'Iranian' issue continues to form a significant part of America's Middle Eastern policy, often considered a crucial element when it comes to defining the legacies of American presidents and their international outlooks. This can be seen most vividly with President Trump, with pulling the United States out of the 'Iran deal' in 2018 widely recognized as one of his first foreign policy acts as president. As Iran recently elected a new president following the sudden death of President Raisi, it will simultaneously be keeping a close eye on Washington and the extent to which the pre-election period, likely to be dominated by Trump's ongoing legal cases, might offer an insight into future American policy towards the country and the region.\n\nThe roots of the hostility\n\nIn the eyes of many Western policy experts and high-profile politicians, 'dealing' with Iran has and will remain a key foreign policy priority. For several decades, the state has been unequivocally characterized as one that is 'hostile' to Western nations and institutions. This portrayal originated several decades ago, with the first set of sanctions introduced by the West against Iran in 1972, followed by a more targeted package in 1992. The country's relationship with Western powers has always been viewed through the prism of geopolitical competition. This involves issues like the highly complex matter of nuclear deterrence, confrontation over the global oil markets and the general perception of Iran in the West as a power that inherently 'misaligns' with its view of the world and international affairs.\n\nIn addition to being seen as an actor that contradicts the key principles upon which the 'Western' system is based, Iran is treated by many with equally extreme caution in the foreign policy sphere. This is often linked with the country's extensive power and influence in the Middle East, with multiple military groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas reliant on Iranian backing. The depth of this support is reflected by the fact that Iran's relationship with these groups is categorized by the informal 'axis of resistance', designed to push back against Western cynicism and 'imperialist' motivations in the Middle East. Crucially, however, it is Iran's nuclear programme and the decade long attempt by the West to manage and constrain its development that has most influenced the state of the country's relationship with the rest of the world. Arguably, it was Donald Trump's time in office that seemed to most intensely de-stabilize a complex relationship suffering from an already highly dangerous level of unpredictability and mistrust.\n\nThe Iran deal and its immediate future\n\nThe Iran Nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was an agreement signed in 2015 between Iran and various other powers, including the United States. The agreement was designed to provide considerable sanction relief to Iran in return for Tehran significantly scaling back its nuclear programme. Despite the deal initially being seen as an essential step to advancing nuclear non-proliferation and preventing Iran from developing into a hostile nuclear power, the decision by President Trump in 2018 to withdraw the United States from the agreement on the basis of it being a counterproductive for American geopolitical interests served to reignite already deep-rooted tensions. Even though President Biden vowed to re-join the Deal upon his arrival in office, the United States is yet to do so. This is the clearest indication that the positions of the sides on the most important issue surrounding the broader relationship, that of Iran's approach to nuclear proliferation, do not converge.\n\nNovember's presidential elections, should Donald Trump emerge victorious, have the potential to cause a major development in American Iranian relations. Throughout the Biden Administration's tenure, partly due to several unprecedented and unforeseen international events such as the global pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the Iran deal was rarely at the forefront of foreign policy discussions. Although Biden was clear in his intentions to re-join the deal at 'some point', this has not materialized and is a process that is likely to be derailed even further should Trump return to the White House. The former president considers Iran an existential threat to American national security, never hesitating to take military action and retaliate whilst in office. The assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was one of several major escalations that occurred in the aftermath of America's withdrawal from the deal, with the drone strikes labelled as a strategic and retaliatory measure to prevent Iran from carrying out further attacks on American personnel in the region. Trump's belief that Iranian foreign policy is the most significant barrier to the prospect of peace in the Middle East is further highlighted by the signing of the Abraham Accords, agreements on the 'normalization' of relations between Israel and a number of Arab states including the UAE primarily through the mutual recognition of sovereignty.\n\nIn parallel to the withdrawal from the 'Iran deal', the Trump administration initiated a campaign of 'maximum pressure' on Tehran which had been designed to 'punish' the country's leadership for supposedly failing to comply with the terms of the JCPOA. Moreover, the Administration proceeded to label the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), essentially the country's principal military organisation, as a terrorist one. Suddenly, it felt like what was a promising agreement designed to overcome a major international security threat had failed to survive into the next decade. The arrival of President Biden had, in theory, signalled to positive change with the President heavily critical of Trump's decision to withdraw. However, through Biden's first term, it never truly felt like the Iran deal was a foreign policy 'priority'. As mentioned, the instability that followed on from the global pandemic and the beginning of the Ukraine war, in addition to challenge of balancing the deep-rooted partnership with Israel and conciliation with Iran, all prevented the Iran deal from being at the forefront of political conversations in Washington. The relationship continues to be shaped by fluctuating levels of tension and d\u00e9tente, with numerous instances of either strengthened sanctions or acts of political goodwill such as the exchange of prisoners and the unfreezing of Iranian revenues affected by decades of sanctions.\n\nIranian and American elections - will the electorate have a major say?\n\nThe election of reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian as Iran's next president, following the untimely death of President Raisi, provides interesting room for thought with regards to the future development of US-Iran relations. Pezeshkian, 69 years old, has a career full of public service, having previously run for president twice and also served as the Minister of Health. He has represented the Tabriz, Osku and Azarshahr electoral districts and served as the Iranian parliament's Deputy Speaker from 2016 to 2020. In principle, the more centrist candidate is expected to be more tolerant towards the idea of working closer with the West and stopping the further isolation of Tehran from the international community. The vote for a more centrist and 'socially liberal' candidate may indicate a willingness among the Iranian population to pursue an agenda of change in both domestic affairs and the foreign policy domain. Nevertheless, given the highly complex nature of the Iranian political system and, ultimately, the role of the Supreme Leader, it is almost certain that major decisions on foreign affairs will remain outside Pezeshkian's list of responsibilities. Therefore, even if there might be appetite among voters for reform and potential realignment with the West, the extent to which this will be possible remains extremely uncertain. Moreover, given the recent escalation between Iran and Israel and the on-going hostility over Gaza and the broader Middle Eastern security landscape, there is little a newly elected president in a system like Iran's can do to radically change the geopolitical reality on the ground. Although Pezeshkian is naturally more willing to engage in negotiations with American leadership and radically differs in this to his hard-line alternative Saeed Jalili, a lot will depend on the way the US approaches the Iranian nuclear challenge and whether this approach will be deemed satisfactory enough by the Iranian side.\n\nElsewhere, US presidential elections represent another potential array of opportunities for the future unfolding of Iran's relationship with the West. The Iranian political class is certain that in the case of a Trump victory, relations will continue to be marked by mutual distrust. Nevertheless, there is no particular sense of optimism surrounding the prospect of a second Biden term. The current president, despite voicing support for the deal, is in no way as passionate of an advocate of the deal as his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that the current situation in Gaza would have been avoided if he had been president, often pointing the blame exclusively at Tehran and its role in establishing and diffusing the 'axis of resistance' of which, crucially, Hamas is a part of. His now famous categorisation of his enemies and opponents as \"bad guys\" or \"bad people\" is likely to be applied to the likes of Iran more forcefully as ever before, should he return as president. This, rightly so, places in question the extent to which an individual president or administration can, in the present regional environment, considerably influence the course of the relationship. The presence of armed confrontation, of which Iran, albeit indirectly, is an integral part, and the potential for further escalation, has undoubtedly overshadowed diplomatic efforts to manage and alleviate what is a deep-rooted and multi-faceted hostility.\n\nMost recently, it was announced that James David Vance, an American senator from Ohio, was chosen as Donald Trump's 'running mate' (Vice-President) for the upcoming election. Vance's international outlook, and more specifically his derogatory remarks about Islam and its role in international affairs will only further exacerbate a strained relationship between Trump and the Iranian political class. Vance has followed Trump in classifying the Iran Deal as a 'disaster', describing Israel as America's closest ally and labelling several countries, including Iran, as 'Islamist' countries. Along with criticising the Western effort to uphold Ukraine's war effort, Vance is unlikely to be willing to compromise on issues politicians like him tend to label as being counter to American self-interest.\n\nBroader lessons for the global order\n\nThere is profound concern in the West that an increasing number of states, historically open in their rejection of a 'Western-oriented' international system, are leaning towards more fragmented cooperation in different alliance blocs. This undoubtedly includes Iran, who in addition to being a powerful player in the Middle East that prioritises countering Israeli influence is also consistently developing closer ties with powers like Russia. Hence, there are genuine concerns about the establishment of an alternative global alliance that seeks to counteract Western influence and instead formulate a common approach to cooperation that prioritises the immediate interests of those states and those of their respective regions. Many in the West are appreciative of this dynamic and have in fact resorted to self-criticism when recognizing the inability of relevant institutions to consolidate and sustain the diffusion of a rules based international order they believe should serve as the guiding principle for all nations. The European Union, for example, has not yet succeeded in its pledge of becoming a powerful force in security and defence. In this case, internal disputes, and the inability to reach consensus on key policy areas tend to further undermine the trust of many in the power of European and Western institutions to act as global leaders. This is further exacerbated by the emergence of far-right nationalism in various European capitals, something several Western leaders appear determined to confront immediately. Nevertheless, despite the consistent framing of the likes of Iran, Russia, and China as 'them' in the 'us versus them' dichotomy, it appears the spread and consolidation of such 'alternative alliances' is now inevitable as they openly deepen and institutionalize their cooperation whilst criticising the 'West' and its international conduct.\n\nWhat should be expected?\n\nDespite its divisive nature, with many questioning its utility in the first place, the Iran deal did achieve a level of 'restraint' in US-Iran relations. However, the deal did not succeed in removing the inherent sense of distrust between the sides. Moreover, Iran's position within the Middle East's dynamic and its relationship with other key actors is an additional element to consider. The escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the unprecedented exchange of strikes between Iran and Israel in April 2024 demonstrates that the sides are certainly not headed for peace and mutual co-existence. Given its status as the leader of the free world, a status that requires both practical and moral leadership, the US will be expected to play a fundamental role in keeping a tap on further armed escalation. However, it will almost certainly be the American electorate that will dictate in what capacity this role will be. Given the considerable weight of the challenge Iran poses, it will undoubtedly be among the leading foreign policy factors voters consider before deciding on the 'next leader of the free world'.\n\nHuseyn Sultanli\n\nAnalyst - Geopolitical Risk, European Cooperation, Azerbaijani foreign policy\n\nMSc International Relations, LSE\n\nLondon, United Kingdom", "source": {"uri":

Returning to the JCPOA might be a strong step in that direction.\n\nThis isn't the first time Blinken has talked up the JCPOA, which the US withdrew from in 2018. During the Davos 2024, the Secretary of State declared the withdrawal from the deal to be a \"big mistake,\" noting that the US no longer has the agreements it needs.\n\nThe JCPOA was negotiated under the Obama Administration. The deal was somewhat complicated in nature, but the broad strokes were that Iran agreed to a level of oversight toward its civilian nuclear program that no nation has ever agreed to in return for sanctions relief.\n\nThe sanctions relief by and large never came, as the US did not ease its sanctions as agreed to, and threatened the other P5+1 nations to prevent them from coming through with sanctions relief. Efforts to try to salvage the deal were derailed when the Trump Administration withdrew from it entirely.\n\nIn trying to force the remaining parties to come to the table to negotiate a settlement, Iran withdrew from some of the voluntary safeguards and increasing its enrichment of uranium to higher levels. Despite no longer being a party to the deal, the US has consistently complained of Iran's 'violations.'\n\nIran has been supportive of the idea of reviving the JCPOA as originally written, with Iran's acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri saying Iran remains committed to the deal, and doesn't believe there is any need for a new agreement, just a restoration of the existing one.\n\nIran has made a point that its \"violations\" in service of trying to lead to negotiations are immediately reversible, and that they made no moves that could lead to the production of nuclear weapons. Reports from the US Director of National Intelligence have repeatedly affirmed that there is no nuclear weapons production even being attempted by Iran.\n\nDespite this, Blinken's comments today centered on the false claim that Iran is capable of producing the fissile material for a nuclear bomb within one or two weeks. He presented this as a breakout capacity for the Iranian program.\n\nIn reality, Iran has never attempted to enrich any uranium over 60%, which is far below the 90%+ needed for weapons-grade uranium. The scare-mongering centers on the belief that Iran has absolute control of its enrichment technology and is able to reconfigure its centrifuges to weapons-grade levels on a whim.\n\nEven if Iran did manage to enrich enough uranium to that level to have enough to theoretically produce a bomb, they would have to then produce a weapon, test a weapon, and then work on miniaturization to try to produce a deliverable weapon. There is no timetable for how long that entire process would take, which is not even relevant because Iran isn't even attempting to do all of this.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5+1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "P5+1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Bagheri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Bagheri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissile_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fissile material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_National_Intelligence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director of National Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741608", "eventUri": "eng-9741608", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, the top U.S. diplomat said: \"Instead of being at least a year away from having the breakout capacity of producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon, [Iran] is now probably one or two weeks away from doing that.\" However, Blinken added, Iran had not yet produced a weapon capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, assessing that achieving this outcome would require more time.\n\nAcknowledging that Iran is unlikely to change its belligerent stance despite the election of Masoud Pezekshian, who has been widely portrayed as a regime \"moderate,\" as the regime's new president, Blinken underlined that the United States still preferred a diplomatic route to prevent Iran from weaponizing its nuclear activities. \"When this administration came in, we tried to pursue again, nuclear diplomacy with Iran, because if you could at least take one problem off the board, which is Iran potentially with a nuclear weapon, that's inherently a good thing,\" Blinken said. He stressed that \"what we need to see, if Iran is serious about engaging, is actually pulling back on the work that it's been doing on this program.\"\n\n\"Secretary Blinken failed to mention that the majority of Iran's nuclear expansion has occurred during his administration amid its failure to enforce sanctions against Tehran. Washington has stood aside as Iran reaches the nuclear threshold and will have no one else to blame if the regime steps over it.\" \u00ad\u00ad Andrea Stricker, FDD Research Fellow and Deputy Director of FDD's Nonproliferation and Biodefense Program\n\n\"The administration's desire for diplomacy and de-escalation at any cost with Iran has not only undermined its deterrence, as well as its ability to close a deal that meaningfully addresses Iran's nuclear program, but also ended up underwriting an expansion of Iran's nuclear capacity that has brought us to this point. Iran's constant escalation of its enriched uranium stockpiles at various levels of purity continues to pay dividends for the Tehran regime, leaving the secretary of state sounding like there's a nuclear fait accompli around the corner.\" -- Behnam Ben Taleblu, FDD Senior Fellow\n\nBlinken's comments came just days after the United States was understood to have warned Iran over intelligence that the regime is working on applications relevant to nuclear weapons. Tehran reportedly explained the activities and denied the regime was seeking nuclear weapons. Axios reported in June that U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies obtained information during March \"that showed Iranian scientists were engaging in computer modeling and metallurgical research\" relevant to nuclear explosive development. The finding may impact an assertion the U.S. intelligence community has made annually since 2019 that Tehran \"is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities necessary to produce a testable nuclear device.\" In recent years, current and former Iranian officials have openly touted the regime's ability to construct nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Washington Warns Iran Over Alleged Nuclear Weapons Work,\" FDD Flash Brief\n\n\"2040: The Year Iran Predicts Israel Will Be Destroyed.

I would have made a great deal with them -- no nuclear weapons,\" Trump said. \"I saw what was happening, they were on the path to a nuclear weapon. I ended the Iran nuclear deal, which was very important to do, it was the stupidest deal,\" Trump told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the nuclear deal, was reached in 2015 between Iran, the US and several other major economies.\n\nIt envisioned billions in sanctions relief in exchange for Iran dismantling its nuclear program and allowing international inspections. In May 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal, saying it allowed Iran access to money used to fund proxy warfare in the region and supply a ballistic missile program.\n\nAlthough the Biden administration said it would re-enter JCPOA, intermittent negotiations have failed to yield results.\n\nMeanwhile, during the Biden administration, Iran's oil revenues have grown significantly.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on April 30 that Iran's oil exports reached their highest level in the last six years with China as the main customer of these shipments.\n\nBiden has been criticized by Republicans for failing to enforce sanctions on Iran, including those designed to limit oil shipments to China. A major talking point has been that this allows Iranian money to fund proxy terror organizations in the Middle East, like Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\n\"The problem is Biden has done nothing with [the deal]. I ended it. But we would have had a deal ... they were broke. They didn't have any money for Hamas ... they had no money for Hezbollah,\" Trump told Bloomberg.\n\nAzadeh Eftekhari, a political analyst and managing editor at Independent Persian, told DW that a second trump administration will be dealing with a Islamic Republic under different conditions.\n\n\"Today, there are two significant wars: the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war, which now also involves Hezbollah, one of the Islamic Republic's arms in the region. Iran's nuclear program has also seen significant development under the Biden administration,\" she said.\n\nTrump's running mate, JD Vance, recently criticized Biden's policy, adding that Trump had prevented Iran from accessing money and \"controlled\" the behavior of the Iranian regime.\n\nVance also criticized the Biden administration's strikes against the Houthis in Yemen and Iranian proxies in Iraq as \"weak little bombing runs.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio, who has appeared with Trump on the campaign trial, said at the Republican National Convention (RNC) that \"the Islamic Republic was bankrupt during Trump's time, but under Biden, it has money to support terrorism.\"\n\nTrump told the convention that Iran is \"on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\"The nuclear issue will be one of the main issues between the Islamic Republic and a potential Trump administration,\" Eftekhari said.\n\n\"An increase in pressures and the imposition of sanctions, which had been almost suspended under the Biden administration, is foreseeable,\" she added.\n\nTrump also targeted Iranian interests with force during his administration.\n\nIn April 2019, Trump designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization. In January 2020, Qassem Soleimani, head of the IRGC's Quds Force, was killed near Baghdad Airport in a US drone strike ordered by Trump.\n\nIran has repeatedly promised revenge for Soleimani's death, although publicly, Iranian officials say Trump should be brought to justice in a court of law.\n\nThis was brought to light again this week after US media reported that US intelligence uncovered an Iranian-backed assassination plot against Trump. The alleged plot was said to have no connection to Saturday's assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani denied the reports as having \"malicious political motives and objectives.\" However, he added that Iran still intends to \"prosecute\" Trump over Soleimani's death.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche

It seems that wherever Iran knocks, everyone answers. Except the United States. Instead, the U.S. continues to close the door, following a long pattern with Iran of undermining its own interests.\n\nIn 2016, Bahrain followed Saudi Arabia in cutting ties with Iran. But in 2024, it began to explore following Saudi Arabia in restoring ties with Iran. On March 10, 2023, Iran and Saudi Arabia stunned the world by announcing that China had brokered an agreement \"to resume diplomatic relations between them and re-open their embassies and missions.\"\n\nA year later, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa suddenly announced that Bahrain is looking forward to improving relations with Iran and that there was no reason to delay. Then, at the end of June 2024, following a meeting by the foreign ministers of the two countries, Iran and Bahrain announced that they had agreed to create a framework on initiating talks on resuming diplomatic relations. \"The two sides,\" a statement said, \"agreed in this meeting to establish the necessary mechanisms to begin talks between the two countries to study how to resume political relations between them.\"\n\nThe move is likely to worry the United States for two reasons. The first is that Bahrain is home to the American Fifth Fleet whose security region includes the Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Arabian Sea, including, especially Iran. The second is that, as China played a key role in the re-establishing of diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia, so Russia played an intermediary role between Iran and Bahrain. On June 7, Iran revealed that the message Bahrain sent to Iran requesting the re-establishment of diplomatic relations was sent through Russia. The two agreements reveal the growing role of Russia and China in a region once comfortably controlled by the United States.\n\nBut Iran's escape artistry is leading to breakouts beyond the region. In July 2023, Iran was welcomed into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an international organization that represents 43% of the world's population and that will grant Iran top level contact and economic relations with global giants like Russia, China, and India. Two months later, along with Saudi Arabia, Iran was welcomed into BRICS. Like the SCO, BRICS includes Russia, China, and India and represents 41.13% of the world's population. It accounts for 37.3% of global GDP.\n\nBut those are not the only doors Iran is knocking on. Though Iran is often criticized in the West for tightly controlling its elections, the leadership's hardline choice lost to the reformist candidate Dr. Masoud Pezeshkian. Pezeshkian campaigned on the need to mend relations with the United States and the West. He has gone so far as to call for bypassing intermediaries in favor of direct negotiations. Pezeshkian included Mohammad Javad Zarif, who, as foreign minister under President Hassan Rouhani, played a key role in negotiating the JCPOA nuclear agreement. And, according to Trita Parsi, an Iran expert at the Quincy Institute, Pezeshkian is likely to usher many foreign policy people from the Rouhani administration back into government.\n\nThis unexpected development would seem to fortuitously align with American interests. But the Biden administration, seemingly incapable of negating with anyone and more committed to enmity with Iran than to de-escalating nuclear tensions, seems bent on undermining its own interest.\n\nAt a July 8 press briefing, National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby was reminded that the U.S. has said \"that they will negotiate or do diplomacy with Iran when it serves our national interests\" by a reporter who then asked, \"So, is the U.S. now ready to resume nuclear talks, other talks, or make any diplomatic moves with Iran in light of this new president?\"\n\nWithout even dedicating any explanation or discussion to the important question, Kirby, in a word, answered, \"No.\" As he moved on to the next question, the reporter, apparently stunned by the answer, cut in: \"Wa- - I'm sorry. 'No'?\" Kirby then expanded on his answer: \"Well, your - it seemed like a pretty easy question to answer. No, we're - we're not in a position where we're willing to get back to the negotiating table with Iran just based on the fact that they've elected a new president.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the United States has spurned overtures from Iranian reformists. There is a long history that has often had the dangerous consequence of discrediting the reformist camp and returning hardliners who are more hostile to the U.S. to power. Former reformist presidents Hashemi Rafsanjani, Seyyed Mohammad Khatami, and Hassan Rouhani have all suffered the same fate that seems to await Pezeshkian.\n\nWhen Rafsanjani offered to exert Iran's regional influence and intervene to help win the release of American hostages being held in Lebanon, President George H.W. Bush promised that Iran would get something in return because \"goodwill begets goodwill.\" Instead, the United States sent word that Rafsanjani should expect no American reciprocation. Rafsanjani and the reformists were discredited.\n\nRafsanjani tried one more time, staying officially neutral when Iraq invaded Kuwait while allowing the U.S. to use Iranian airspace. In return, the U.S. snubbed Iran at the Madrid Peace conference and perpetuated the isolation of Iran.\n\nReformist President Khatami offered the U.S. the rejection of terrorism, acceptance of a two-state solution, implicit recognition of Israel, aid in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and invaluable help in setting up a post-Taliban government in Afghanistan. In return, George W. Bush awarded Iran a seat in the Axis of Evil. Khatami was stunned, and the reformists were discredited.\n\nIn 2013, Iranians returned a reformist to power. Hassan Rouhani bet everything on improved relations with the West and negotiations over Iran's civilian nuclear program. But Rouhani and the reformists were, once again, disgraced and discredited when Donald Trump broke America's promise and pulled out of the JCPOA nuclear agreement. President Joe Biden's refusal to return to talks dealt what may be the final blow to the reformists.\n\nSurprisingly, though, the reformists have been resurrected with the election of Pezeshkian. Instead of seizing the opportunity and accepting the invitation to negotiate with Iran and calming a volatile relationship, the U.S. seems to be sticking with its policy of discrediting reformist Iranian presidents and rejecting offers to negotiate a nuclear agreement in favor of a futile policy of attempting to isolate Iran and preserve hostility. Once again, the United States is passing on peace and undermining its own interests in Iran.", "source": {"uri": "original.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Antiwar.com Original"},

This is a shame...the damage that this administration has done,\" said Trump to a cheering crowd.\n\nIran has enriched enough uranium to 60% purity for at least three bombs, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran could convert uranium enriched to 60% to bomb-grade fuel in just a matter of days.\n\nIran's nuclear gains under Biden's administration, according the FDD's Behnam Ben Taleblu, are irreversible and his approach has led to a \"credibility crisis.\"\n\n\"The contradictory approach under Biden of trying to de-escalate and establish deterrence has led to a credibility crisis exploited by US adversaries,\" he said.\n\nTrump reiterated his claim that Iran was on the verge of agreeing to negotiate a new deal to more strictly curb its nuclear program before Trump lost the 2020 election.\n\nHe also said that the Oct 7 atrocities would have never happened on his watch.\n\n\"Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years.

Through his strategy of cost imposition Tehran struggled to pay its proxies and even keep some of its propaganda stations afloat,\" said Taleblu.\n\nTrump's statement that the attack on Israel would not have happened with him as president is not new.\n\nSpeaking on Iran International's podcast Eye for Iran, which aired before the final night of the RNC, Trump's former National security advisor, John Bolton, said nobody knows what would have happened.\n\n\"It's one of those Trump statements that's neither provable nor disprovable. Nobody knows because he wasn't president,\" said Bolton.\n\nJason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran said Trump understands how to make US adversaries fear the American president.\n\n\"There is an important strategic logic to that dynamic.

We deeply value this friendship. Our 25-year roadmap with China represents a significant milestone toward establishing a mutually beneficial \"comprehensive strategic partnership,\" and we look forward to collaborating more extensively with Beijing as we advance toward a new global order. In 2023, China played a pivotal role in facilitating the normalization of our relations with Saudi Arabia, showcasing its constructive vision and forward-thinking approach to international affairs.\n\nRussia is a valued strategic ally and neighbor to Iran, and my administration will remain committed to expanding and enhancing our cooperation. We strive for peace for the people of Russia and Ukraine, and my government will stand prepared to actively support initiatives aimed at achieving this objective. I will continue to prioritize bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Russia, particularly within frameworks such as Brics, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Eurasia Economic Union.\n\nRecognizing that the global landscape has evolved beyond traditional dynamics, my administration is committed to fostering mutually beneficial relations with emerging international players in the Global South, especially with African nations. We will strive to enhance our collaborative efforts and strengthen our partnerships for the mutual benefit of all involved.\n\nIran's relations with Latin America are well-established and will be closely maintained and deepened to foster development, dialogue and cooperation in all fields. There is significantly more potential for cooperation between Iran and the countries of Latin America than what is currently being realized, and we look forward to further strengthening our ties.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nIran's relations with Europe have known its ups and downs. After the United States' withdrawal from the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) in May 2018, European countries made 11 commitments to Iran to try to salvage the agreement and mitigate the impact of the United States' unlawful and unilateral sanctions on our economy. These commitments involved ensuring effective banking transactions, effective protection of companies from US sanctions, and the promotion of investments in Iran. European countries have reneged on all these commitments yet unreasonably expect Iran to unilaterally fulfill all its obligations under the JCPOA.\n\nDespite these missteps, I look forward to engaging in constructive dialogue with European countries to set our relations on the right path based on principles of mutual respect and equal footing. European countries should realize that Iranians are a proud people whose rights and dignity can no longer be overlooked. There are numerous areas of cooperation that Iran and Europe can explore once European powers come to terms with this reality and set aside self-arrogated moral supremacy coupled with manufactured crises that have plagued our relations for so long. Opportunities for collaboration include economic and technological cooperation, energy security, transit routes, and the environment, as well as combating terrorism and drug trafficking, refugee crises, and other fields, all of which could be pursued to the benefit of our nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United States also needs to recognize the reality and understand, once and for all, that Iran does not -- and will not -- respond to pressure. We entered the JCPOA in 2015 in good faith and fully met our obligations. But the United States unlawfully withdrew from the agreement motivated by purely domestic quarrels and vengeance, inflicting hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to our economy and causing untold suffering, death and destruction on the Iranian people -- particularly during the Covid pandemic -- through the imposition of extraterritorial unilateral sanctions. The US deliberately chose to escalate hostilities by waging not only an economic war against Iran but also engaging in state terrorism by assassinating Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a global anti-terrorism hero known for his success in saving the people of our region from the scourge of IS and other ferocious terrorist groups. Today, the world is witnessing the harmful consequences of that choice.\n\nThe US and its Western allies not only missed a historic opportunity to reduce and manage tensions in the region and the world but also seriously undermined the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) by showing that the costs of adhering to the tenets of the non-proliferation regime could outweigh the benefits it may offer. Indeed, the US and its Western allies have abused the non-proliferation regime to fabricate a crisis regarding Iran's peaceful nuclear program -- openly contradicting their own intelligence assessment -- and use it to maintain sustained pressure on our people, while they have actively contributed to and continue to support the nuclear weapons of Israel, an apartheid regime, a compulsive aggressor and a non-NPT member and a known possessor of illegal nuclear arsenal.\n\nI wish to emphasize that Iran's defense doctrine does not include nuclear weapons and urge the United States to learn from past miscalculations and adjust its policy accordingly. Decision-makers in Washington need to recognize that a policy that consists of pitting regional countries against each other has not succeeded and will not succeed in the future. They need to come to terms with this reality and avoid exacerbating current tensions.\n\nThe Iranian people have entrusted me with a strong mandate to vigorously pursue constructive engagement on the international stage while insisting on our rights, our dignity and our deserved role in the region and the world. I extend an open invitation to those willing to join us in this historic endeavor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian is Iran's president-elect.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType":

While there were expectations that a conservative hardliner like Jalili would prevail over the competition, the results of the first round of voting held on June 28 made this assumption doubtful as Pezeshkian garnered 42.45 per cent of votes, while Jalili came in second with 38.61 per cent.\n\nWith Masoud Pezeshkian becoming president, there is a definite change of guard, as the reformists have prevailed over the hardline conservatives. The election also puts an end to a turbulent period in Iran following the death of its former president, Ebrahim Raisi, in an unfortunate helicopter crash on May 19, 2024.\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian, 69, is an ethnic Azeri Turk and a five-term parliamentarian who served as Minister of Health and Medical Education under reformist President Mohmmad Khatami from 2001-05. He is a cardiac surgeon by profession and has a more pragmatic and open world view as compared to many conservatives in Iran.\n\nOn the foreign policy front, he supports a 'balanced foreign policy' and insists on preserving Iranian and Persian pride while negotiating with the world on the basis of \"dignity, wisdom, and expediency\". In his 'message to the new world', published on July 12, he stressed that his administration will be guided by a commitment to preserving Iran's national dignity and international stature under all circumstances.\n\nOn relations within the region, he added that he will prioritise strengthening relations with the neighbours and champion the establishment of a \"strong region\" rather than one where a single country pursues hegemony and dominance over the others.\n\nHis main foreign policy advisor, Javed Zarif, who is largely tipped to be appointed the foreign minister, was also the FM under President Hassan Rouhani, Raisi's predecessor, who had helped clinch the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). There is therefore obvious optimism that there could be some kind of breakthrough in the nuclear deal under the new regime.\n\nWhat Happened to the Nuclear Deal?\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal, or JCPOA, was signed on July 14, 2015, after persistent efforts of diplomacy and negotiations over five years between Iran and P5 plus 1. It was an 'instrument of faith' between the two parties that incorporated strict checks and balances aimed at ensuring a strict vigil on Iran's nuclear programme, lest Iran progress to developing a nuclear weapon. At the same time, tough and crippling economic sanctions against Iran were revoked, giving Iran much-needed economic relief. Most importantly, Iran agreed to 'anywhere, anytime' inspections of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA and UN inspectors. On January 16, 2016, designated as Implementation Day, the IAEA verified that Iran had met all its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA, triggering the lifting of sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe hard work was soon undone as Donald Trump, who was strongly opposed to the deal and had called JCPOA a 'horrible deal', won the US presidential elections in November 2016 and immediately announced that he would impose \"the highest level of economic sanctions\" on Iran. And, on May 8, 2018, he pulled the plug on the nuclear deal. Despite concerted efforts by other members of P5 plus 1, the UN, and the IAEA, he did not relent, and Iran was pushed back into a strict sanctions regime.\n\nEfforts to revive the nuclear deal commenced only after Joe Biden became US President in January 2021. The talks commenced in April 2021 and continued till January 2022, when the eighth round was concluded with the understanding that most of the technical issues had been agreed to and the deal was now possible within the parameters of 'political decisions'. However, the Ukraine war broke out on February 24, 2022, and the Iran nuclear talks have been on the backburner since then.\n\nThe Current Status\n\nWhile there has been no progress on the Iran nuclear talks for over two years now, the Iran nuclear programme has been progressing at a rapid pace. It may be recalled that, forced by unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear deal by the US and other punitive actions, including re-imposing tough economic sanctions, designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation on April 8, 2019, and the assassination of IRGC Commander Qasem Soleimani by US drone on January 3, 2020, Iran recommenced uranium enrichment on December 2, 2020, to enrichment levels of 20 percent purity. A few months later, on April 13, 2021, soon after a cyberattack on the Natanz nuclear plant, Iran announced that it would enrich uranium to 60 per cent, which it has continued since then.\n\nIn January 2023, an IAEA report raised alarm when its inspectors discovered that two cascades of IR-6 centrifuges at the Fordo nuclear plant in Iran had been configured in a way \"substantially different\" from what had been previously declared. The samples collected showed particles up to 83.7 percent enriched uranium, very close to 90 percent required for weapon grade uranium. Iran dismissed the concerns, stating that in the process of enrichment, small particles do get highly enriched.\n\nThere were reports of Iran slowing down its enrichment in August 2023 when the US and Iran were in indirect talks for a prisoner exchange, but following the outbreak of wear in Gaza in October 2023, Iran has increased the pace and is enriching uranium to 60 per cent, at a scale of 9 kg per month. Most of this high enrichment is taking place at its Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP) in Natanz and the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP), which is dug into a mountain.\n\nAs per the IAEA report of May 2024, Iran's total enriched uranium stockpile was 5,841 kilogrammes, of which Iran had an estimated 142.1 kilogrammes of uranium enriched up to 60 per cent purity. By the IAEA's own theoretical definition, around 42 kg of uranium enriched to 60 per cent is required to make the required amount of highly enriched (beyond 90 per cent) enriched uranium for one nuclear bomb. By this calculation, Iran already has the required enriched uranium to make weapon-grade uranium for three bombs.\n\nOptions and Possibilities\n\nWhen examining the possibilities of the revival of the nuclear deal, there are a few important issues to be examined. Firstly, it was a unilateral move by the US that led to the revocation of the nuclear deal, not any provocation or violation of the deal by Iran. In fact, despite the US pulling out of the deal in May 2018, Iran continued compliance with the terms of the deal until March 6, 2019, the last time that the IAEA reported that Iran was implementing all its nuclear-related commitments. It was only after the US designated the IRGC of Iran as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation on April 8, 2019, that Iran started enriching uranium again.\n\nSecondly, in the eight rounds of talks on the deal since April 2021, Iran has reportedly agreed to most terms regarding the rollback of enrichment. It has, however, sought a sovereign assurance that the US will not unilaterally revoke the deal in the future and, secondly, that the US should remove the IRGC from its list of foreign terrorist organisations. On both issues, the US is not ready to concede. There is also an issue regarding Iran's rapidly advancing ballistic missile programme that the US wants to be reined in and included in the deal, for which Iran is not ready, calling it extraneous to the scope of the nuclear issue.\n\nThirdly, the issue of changing dynamics in the region too has direct implications for Iran wanting a nuclear weapon and, hence, its effect on a possible deal. Since March 2023, there has been a wave of reconciliation in West Asia, triggered by the Saudi-Iran peace deal brokered by China.\n\nIran's suspected desire to secretly weaponise its nuclear programme was based on its animosity and rivalry with its neighbours in the region, besides, of course, Israel. Following the reconciliation in the region, if Iran is no longer enemy No. 1, a large part of the motivation to have a nuclear weapons programme therefore gets dissipated. Although it is premature to say that Iran would be accepted as a trustworthy partner in the largely Sunni Arab world, new emerging dynamics may be beneficial to Iran in the long run.\n\nTo add to it, the ongoing war in Gaza and the brief military spat between Israel and Iran in April 2024 have shown the world the potent and punitive military capability that Iran possesses and that it is more than capable of taking on any threat with conventional military capability too.\n\nFourthly, the big question is: Does Iran require a nuclear weapon? The answer presently is 'no'. Even President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian, in his 'message to the new world' on July 12, said that Iran's defence doctrine does not include nuclear weapons and urged the US to learn from past miscalculations and adjust its policy accordingly.\n\nEven the Supreme Leader Khamenei has repeatedly stated that it is \"haram\", or forbidden in Islam, to develop a weapon like a nuclear bomb. Also, if and when Iran does announce its nuclear weapon capability, it could change and roll back years of efforts of reconciliation in the region, as others in the region like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, etc may be forced to acquire nuclear weapons too and set off a weapons race, which is not at all in Iran's interests. It may therefore prefer to maintain a level of 'nuclear latency', just below the threshold of a declared nuclear weapons programme.\n\nChances of a Revival?\n\nPresident-elect Masoud Pezeshkian and his likely foreign minister, Javed Zarif, are likely to pursue nuclear deal talks as it has the potential to unlock a relief from a lot of misery and economic sanctions imposed on the Iranian people. However, whether they would be able to push it beyond the status attained at the end of the eight rounds of talks in January 2022, when most of the technical issues were agreed to and the deal was within the parameters of 'political decisions', is a big question.\n\nAlso, the US presidential election cycle is underway, and to think that the Iran nuclear issue could find focus and priority at the end of the current presidency is very unlikely. The ongoing war in Gaza and the resultant US support for Israel, as opposed to Iran's support for Hamas and Hezbollah, is also a major dampener in any early talks between the US and Iran. The real possibility of Donald Trump winning the presidential elections in November could be the final nail in any future possibility of nuclear deal talks, as it was Trump who, in the first place, revoked the deal unilaterally in May 2018. The road towards the nuclear deal therefore looks tough, and factors opposing it seem to outrank the hopes of a revival.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"},

It is now time for peace.\" In another odd statement the former diplomat said that political parties do not determine American foreign policy, perhaps hinting that Washington's position regarding Iran transcends Republican or Democratic administrations.\n\nThe centrist website noted that the United States currently shows little interest in political changes in Iran or nuclear negotiations with Iranian officials. At the same time, Iran's President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian, in his latest statements, welcomed negotiations with Europe but expressed no interest in talks with the United States.\n\nThe discussion about what will follow the recent presidential elections in Iran is a recurrent theme in Tehran's government-controlled media, that mostly tries to highlight Pezeshkian's positive statements about the need to have good relations with other countries. But media outlets rarely mention his back-and-forth messages of support for Iran's militant proxy forces.\n\nHighlighting that Iran has lagged behind in development for 45 years, Majlesi stated that Iran needs to reduce tensions with the United States and Israel and demonstrate goodwill to reach a compromise and normalize the situation. Additionally, Iran should accept international banking protocols and conduct transactions using US dollars to facilitate international trade.\n\nHowever, no media outlet mentions that this requires a drastic change in foreign policy that only Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei can authorize.\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with the Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA), international relations analyst Reza Nasri said that if the Pezeshkian administration is looking for economic development, it should first seek security and stability in the region.\n\nNasri added that like Saudi officials, Pezeshkian believes that regional countries should not waste their financial resources on attritional conflicts. Majlesi had also pointed out that so far, Iran has been wasting its resources in wars against other regional and Muslim countries.\n\nNasri explained that Pezeshkian's declared foreign policy is based on the three pillars of balanced relations with regional states, constructive interaction to facilitate development and adopting policies that would not be costly for the people's livelihood. He also pointed out that Tehran and the United States should conduct negotiations at one point as both are major players in the region and cannot ignore each other.\n\nTo this end, he said, Pezeshkian should put together an agile foreign policy team of pragmatic officials mindful of the fact that unpredictable situations might be awaiting us six months later. The new Iranian foreign policy team should be prepared to face any scenario, he added.\n\nNonetheless, speaking about the support Pezeshkian has expressed for the \"axis of resistance,\" - or Iran's proxies - Nasri said that a solid and strong diplomacy by Iran as well as international support for the Palestinian cause, could turn the resistance into a legitimate \"liberation movement.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former ambassador to the United Kingdom Mohammad Hossein Adeli told the press in Tehran that \"Iran is playing a game at the edge of a cliff,\" and added that \"those who still talk about circumventing the sanctions are in fact thinking of the continuation of sanctions.\" He was likely referring to influential insiders who are widely believed to be profiting from the US oil export and international banking sanctions.\n\nAdeli warned that \"The slightest error in foreign policy can drag Iran into an instability that might affect the country's existence.\" He urged Pezeshkian to adopt a realistic approach and carefully assess the regional and international situation.\n\nAdeli further cautioned that regional developments could lead Iran into a war benefiting Israel and the United States. He stressed the need for Pezeshkian to assemble a foreign policy team capable of navigating and avoiding such dangerous scenarios.", "source": {"uri": "iranintl.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Responding to Nasrallah's congratulatory message, Pezeshkian pledged continued support to the Resistance Axis backed by Iran in the region.\n\n\"The Islamic Republic of Iran has always supported the resistance of the people in the region against the illegitimate Zionist regime,\" Pezeshkian wrote. \"Supporting the resistance is rooted in the fundamental policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran and will continue with strength.\"\n\nIn response to these comments, an Israeli researcher posted on her X account, \"If anyone here dreamed that the new Iranian president Pezeshkian would bring about a change in the militant policy of the Iranian regime that strives to destroy Israel, this letter is for you.\"\n\nWhile the Israeli response to Pezeshkian's election was understandably skeptical, the global reaction might differ. The international community, notably the West, is in no hurry to lay its trust and optimism in the incoming Iranian president, considering previous disappointments with Iranian behavior under earlier pragmatic presidents. For example, both the nuclear and ballistic missile programs saw significant progress under President Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005). Iran's supported regional network of non-state groups was also expanded under pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani (2013-2021). Nonetheless, the new president will likely be given a chance.\n\nThe possible appointment of Abbas Araghchi, a former nuclear negotiator and deputy foreign minister, as Pezeshkian's foreign minister has already raised some hopes for re-engaging Iran in diplomatic dialogue with the West to find a political solution to the nuclear issue -- or even to the growing tension between Iran and the United States in the Middle East. On the other hand, the election of contender Saeed Jalili, the most extremist candidate in the presidential elections, could have helped Israel persuade the world community that there is no purpose in engaging with Iran and that additional pressure should be used against the Islamic Republic.\n\nIt is indeed highly improbable that the incoming Iranian president can or will change the Islamic Republic's attitude toward Israel or its backing of its network of regional proxies. Not only are the president's powers largely confined to domestic affairs, but the engagement of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) -- particularly the Quds Force -- in regional affairs significantly inhibits the president's capacity to intercede. It is, therefore, not surprising that President Rouhani's term was marked by rivalries and tensions between his government and the IRGC.\n\nIn a leaked audiotape released shortly before the end of Rouhani's term in 2021, then Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the IRGC calls the shots, overruling many government decisions and ignoring advice. \"In the Islamic Republic, the battlefield rules,\" Zarif said in a three-hour taped conversation that was part of an oral history project documenting the current administration's work. \"I have sacrificed diplomacy for the battlefield rather than the field servicing diplomacy.\"\n\nWith that in mind, Pezeshkian's views on Israel mirror the current consensus among Iranian decision-makers. After voting in the first round of the presidential election, the reformist candidate told journalists he hoped his country would try to have friendly relations \"with all countries except for Israel.\"\n\nTwenty-seven years ago, the election of a reformist president in Iran raised significant expectations in Israel. At a discussion held in the Knesset on May 28, 1997, then Foreign Minister David Levy responded to Khatami's election as president, stating that a momentous transition was taking place in Iran that needed to be followed closely. Levy emphasized that Iran's foreign policy was largely dictated by the supreme leader, who opposed relations with the West, but also expressed hope that the long-awaited change would soon be felt thanks to Khatami, who was \"a person with education and knowledge in various fields who is familiar with the Western world.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"We would be very happy to see Iran join the regional effort to reduce tensions, stop terrorism, and seek ways of cooperation and peace...Perhaps we will soon see the change that we all expect.\"\n\nHowever, during the last three decades, it has become evident that an Iranian president, no matter how reformist or pragmatic, has limited capacity to alter Iranian policy on issues concerning Israel's national security. Furthermore, the confrontation between the two countries has escalated significantly. Iran's nuclear progress, its development of sophisticated weapons systems such as long-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), its growing regional involvement, and its continued support for terrorist organizations -- including Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad -- all pose a strategic threat to Israel's national security.\n\nAs a result, Israel, particularly under Benjamin Netanyahu's premiership, has increased its efforts to rally the international community against the Islamic Republic. Under these conditions, hardline presidents like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Ebrahim Raisi, who openly called for Israel's destruction, became assets to Israel. In contrast, more pragmatic presidents were viewed as a burden and a challenge that could make it more difficult to persuade the rest of the world to join the campaign against Iran and to avoid pursuing diplomacy with Tehran.\n\nIt is, therefore, no surprise that Prime Minister Netanyahu was quick to denounce President Rouhani shortly after his election in the summer of 2013. Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in the fall of 2013, Netanyahu dismissed the new Iranian president's charm offensive, saying, \"Rouhani doesn't sound like Ahmadinejad, but when it comes to Iran's nuclear weapons program, the only difference between them is this: Ahmadinejad was a wolf in wolf's clothing; Rouhani is a wolf in sheep's clothing.\"\n\nPezeshkian's election comes at a time of rising concern in Israel about Iran. Israel's hawkish opposition, Knesset member Avigdor Lieberman, argued on June 5 that Iran is planning a holocaust for Israel in the next two years. \"We are in the midst of an Iranian extermination program,\" the Yisrael Beytenu party chairman said, arguing that if Iran is allowed to create a \"nuclear umbrella,\" it will use the deterrence it has obtained to launch a devastating strike. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was quoted in Ha'aretz in mid-June warning that, in six months to a year, Iran will launch a multifront war of attrition against Israel aimed at its collapse and then annihilation. These statements come against the background of Iran's continued implementation of the \"unification of the arenas\" strategy against Israel since October 7, 2023, as well as reports of alarming progress in its nuclear program.\n\nSenior Iranian officials, led by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, have recently stated that the end of Israel is near, adding to Israel's rising concerns about Iran's intentions. At the anniversary ceremony commemorating the death of the founder of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's leader stated that the Hamas attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, dealt a decisive blow to the \"Zionist regime,\" a blow from which there is no recovery. In a meeting with Hamas's leader on the sidelines of President Raisi's funeral, Khamenei said, \"The divine promise to eliminate the Zionist entity will be fulfilled, and we will see the day when Palestine will rise from the river to the sea.\"\n\nThese statements are interpreted in Israel as an expression of a shift in Iran's mindset, as well as a possible indication that the Iranian leadership believes the ongoing campaign in Gaza and Israel's weakening have created ripe conditions for the realization of its ideological vision of Israel's destruction. Under these circumstances, the world might be willing to give the next president a chance, but Israel may be more anxious about the potential of needing to confront the Iranian menace alone.\n\nDr. Raz Zimmt is a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies at Tel Aviv University.

In this regard, it is noteworthy that Iran's strategic culture -- encompassing shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior derived from common experiences and accepted narratives that shape collective identity and relations with other groups, thereby determining appropriate goals and means to achieve security objectives -- is not determined by any one government but is integral to the non-negotiable principles upon which the country is built.\n\nIn general terms, two principles directly related to Islamic identity can be highlighted as foundational, with the rest built upon them:\n\n1. Achieving unity within Islam through the known \"Ummatic mandate.\" This involves adhering to the idea of Imam Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, and seeking reconciliation between Sunni and Shia. In essence, it assumes Islam as a common language enabling Muslims to interact and debate within the boundaries of this language. Technically, this unity within Islam is known as the \"post-Mazhabi vision\" (mazhab or madhhab meaning legal school in Arabic).\n\n2. Building a just society: This is an ethical-political aspiration serving as an ever-present yet never fully attainable horizon. This horizon compels Muslims to tirelessly combat oppression in its various forms and manifestations.\n\nThus, it can be said that the focal point around which the entire Iranian discourse is articulated is \"Islamic, revolutionary, and anti-Western identity.\" From this point, one can comprehend all aspects of Iran's foreign and defensive policies. This pivotal point integrates several signifiers such as independence, resistance, Islamic unity, and responsibility towards the Ummah to shape the Islamic discourse and simultaneously differentiate it from others.\n\nOne unique principle in Iranian foreign policy is its responsibility towards the Muslim world. This transnational responsibility views Iranian actions beyond its borders as an \"ideological duty.\" Within this framework lies the anti-Zionist policy and support for Islamic resistance movements in the region, known as the \"Axis of Resistance.\" In this context, the President committed in the column to urging neighboring Arab countries to \"collaborate and utilize all political and diplomatic influences to prioritize achieving a permanent ceasefire in Gaza aimed at halting the massacre and preventing escalation of the conflict.\"\n\nIran's regional policy cannot be understood solely through instrumental rationality and cost-benefit logic without considering the logic of responsibility based on political Islam. Another principle underpinning Iran's strategic culture is its anti-hegemonic vocation and will of resistance. Grounded in the idea that Islam should prevail and not be dominated by others, the Islamic Republic understands it cannot be influenced by other countries when designing and implementing its foreign policy. This anti-imperialist identity is rooted in Iran's history and the numerous attempts by Western powers to control the country.\n\nTo achieve its counter-hegemonic goal, Iran seeks intentional cooperation, coalitions, and alliances among anti-hegemonic forces at individual, state, and non-governmental levels. To this end, Iran has extended efforts to forge fronts against imperialism in the Third World, the Islamic world, and the Asian continent. In line with its \"anti-hegemonic\" and \"resistance\" discourses, Iran implements two main strategies: the \"Look to the East\" policy and South-South alliances.\n\nAnother essential principle in understanding Iran's strategic culture is discernment. This principle became crucial in Iranian foreign policy since the second decade of the Islamic Revolution. Based on Shia political jurisprudence, it seeks to combine anti-arrogance and anti-hegemonic vision with prudence in foreign policy. In fact, the principle of discernment elevates the survival of the Islamic Republic to a supreme value. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has avoided serious involvement in international disputes and conflicts to preserve its survival and vital interests. In this sense, there are several cases showing that Iran has adopted a pragmatic and opportunity-oriented approach to reduce risks and costs in its foreign policy. The doctrine of discernment is also known as the doctrine of strategic patience.\n\nFollowing the events of April 1st, when Israel attacked Iran's consulate in Damascus, and the subsequent response by the Islamic Republic framed within \"Operation True Promise,\" Iranian authorities have entered a new strategic phase known as active deterrence (or offensive defense), wherein any Israeli action will be directly responded to by Iran.\n\nTwo other fundamental principles within Iran's strategic culture are self-sufficiency and independence. Since the Iranian Revolution, the pursuit of indigenous capabilities, technology, and knowledge, especially regarding the nuclear fuel cycle, has become a matter of national pride. In this way, Iran aims to eliminate its dependence on foreign powers. Iran's Supreme Leader argues that there is a causal relationship between scientific advancement, self-sufficiency, and independence. Ayatollah Khamenei maintains that U.S. and European sanctions against Iran are not only ineffective in changing Iran's foreign policy but are actually constructive because they compel Iran to become more self-sufficient.\n\nThe defense of these principles is not subject to the will of any specific government, whether reformist or principalist. They are necessary principles for the political existence of the Islamic Republic itself. However, this does not imply that there is no ample room within which these same objectives can be achieved, even though there may not always be agreement on how to achieve them.\n\nSpecifically, President-elect Pezeshkian addressed in his opinion column the priority of strengthening relations with neighboring countries. \"We will defend the establishment of a 'strong region' rather than one where a single country seeks hegemony and dominance over others,\" he pointed out. \"I firmly believe that neighboring and brotherly nations should not squander their valuable resources on erosive competitions, arms races, or unjustified containment among themselves,\" he added.\n\nThis political vision shares objectives with the \"good neighborliness\" policy implemented by the late President Raisi's government, which also prioritized friendly relations among neighboring countries. It is worth noting that in their first meeting, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei advised President-elect Pezeshkian to continue President Raisi's political legacy.\n\nFurthermore, from a pragmatic standpoint, a policy based on horizontal relations, free from oppressions and pressures, would facilitate the construction of an autonomous region where the military presence of Western countries, mainly the United States, would have no justification.\n\nIn this regard, there appears to be continuity between the \"good neighborliness\" policy and Pezeshkian's policy of \"leveraging our normative influence to play a crucial role in the emerging multipolar global order by promoting peace, creating a conducive environment for sustainable development, fostering dialogue, and dispelling Islamophobia.\"\n\nAnother priority highlighted by the president-elect was bilateral relations between Iran, China, and Russia. Pezeshkian emphasized China's pivotal role in facilitating the normalization of relations with Saudi Arabia, \"demonstrating its constructive vision and forward-looking approach in international affairs.\"\n\nRegarding Russia, he expressed confidence that his administration will continue to expand and enhance relations. He also addressed the need to find a diplomatic solution to the current situation in Ukraine. \"We advocate for peace for the people of Russia and Ukraine, and my government will be prepared to actively support initiatives aimed at achieving this goal,\" the president noted.\n\nFinally, the column focused on relations with the West, specifically with the EU and the United States. This was an electoral commitment of the new president: \"to engage in constructive dialogue with European countries to steer our relations in the right direction, based on principles of mutual respect and equality.\" Pezeshkian acknowledged that Iran's relationship with the EU has experienced numerous \"ups and downs,\" but despite this, the new government aims to improve relations.\n\nRegarding the United States, President-elect Pezeshkian stated that Iran will not yield to external pressure and criticized the U.S. unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, accusing it of inflicting serious economic and humanitarian damage on the Iranian people. He further emphasized that Iran's defense doctrine excludes nuclear weapons and called on the U.S. to learn from its past mistakes and adjust its policy towards Iran. He also criticized the U.S. and its Western allies for undermining the Non-Proliferation Treaty and manipulating the crisis surrounding Iran's nuclear program while supporting Israel's nuclear weapons. Pezeshkian urged Washington to recognize that the strategy of dividing countries in the region has not succeeded and will not in the future, advocating for an approach that avoids escalating current tensions.\n\nIt is important to note that the president-elect does not have the authority to initiate talks with the West, as this falls under the jurisdiction of the Leader. However, as mentioned in previous articles, the president can influence decisions of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC). For instance, he can exert influence through the appointment of specific ministers and experts, as well as presenting dossiers for discussion in appropriate bodies like the SNSC. Additionally, he has the prerogative to lead negotiations between Iran and other international actors.\n\nIn conclusion, there are fundamental and non-negotiable principles that give the Islamic Republic its distinctive political character. These principles structure the program of the president-elect in terms of foreign policy. It can be asserted that Iranian strategic culture is based on various discourses centered around Islam as a focal point, shaping the identity of the Islamic Republic and determining not only how Iran behaves politically, but also who is considered friend and foe.\n\nPresident Pezeshkian's column expresses respect for these discursive frameworks and the fundamental principles of the Islamic Republic, without implying a renunciation of his electoral program, which must be consensus-based with the rest of the state institutions.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The former health minister's victory can be said to reflect the Iranian population's desire to see an end to Western economic sanctions and their wish for economic stabilization.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the Shiite nation's head of state is not the president but the supreme leader, or rahbar. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say in deciding the fundamentals of Iran's national strategies, including those for negotiations with the West over the lifting of economic sanctions and Iran's approach to the armed conflict between Israel and the Islamist group Hamas in Gaza and the civil war in Syria.\n\nThat is why, when Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Tehran, Khamenei is the one he holds lengthy talks with. He meets with the president only briefly.\n\nPezeshkian ran in the election as one of the candidates approved by the Guardian Council, a panel that supervises presidential elections and is ultimately overseen by the supreme leader. In other words, the president-elect is a Khamenei-approved reformist. This means Pezeshkian will face many obstacles if he seeks to restore the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement with the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China -- from which then U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018 -- as a way of bringing an end to economic sanctions to improve the Iranian people's lives.\n\nAs of early July, the Iranian rial's foreign exchange rate was about one-nineteenth of what it was when the nuclear deal was signed. One of the president-elect's urgent tasks is to stabilize the currency rate and lower Iran's annual average inflation rate, which has risen to about 40%.\n\nTo that end, it is indispensable for Iran to resume oil exports and normalize trade to earn foreign currency.\n\nTo pursue such goals, Pezeshkian will have to win support for his policy initiatives from conservative hardline lawmakers, who hold a majority in the Iranian parliament, and from their master, Khamenei.\n\nBut it would be difficult for Khamenei to make concessions to the major Western countries to bring an end to sanctions if that agreement were to sacrifice the Tehran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- who both support Iran's Islamic Revolution -- as well as the Palestinian extremist group Hamas in Gaza and militias in Syria.\n\nIs it therefore a foregone conclusion that Khamenei does not prioritize the lifting of sanctions? His thinking can hardly be that simple.\n\nAncient Roman historian Pompeius Trogus (active in the first century B.C.) is quoted as writing: \"The king himself was always seen first to take to flight and last in battle. He was timid in danger and became haughty once the threat went away.\"\n\nThe king Trogus ridiculed was King Xerxes of the Achaemenid Empire, who was defeated in the Persian Wars.\n\nIt is interesting to know that Xerxes and Khamenei have something in common. The Iranian supreme leader often scrutinizes the prevailing political circumstances so carefully that he tends to be ridiculed as timid. On the other hand, he sometimes takes bold political action while remaining silent.\n\nTo tell the truth, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a politician who, too, has two sides -- timidity and haughtiness. Though he tends to be considered rather talkative, he may be a strategist comparable to Xerxes and Khamenei in terms of always skillfully figuring out the timing of his escape even while waging a fierce attack.\n\nThe reality of history is that the more spectacular a leader's words and actions are, the more likely unexpected crises and destruction are to ensue. Especially in the Middle East, there are scenes of silence that may put to shame even kabuki actors performing in the \"danmari\" (\"in the dark\" pantomime) scene of \"Kagatobi\" (firefighter of the Kaga clan). In that scene, all the actors must pretend not to be able to see each other or anything on the stage while searching for each other in silence in the dark.\n\nAs recently as April, the Middle East witnessed an example of \"danmari,\" which helped to avoid an escalation of the Israel-Iran crisis.\n\nOn April 1, an Israeli airstrike demolished Iran's consulate in Damascus, killing three senior Iranian commanders, including Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Iran was enraged over the illegality of the attack on its embassy premises, which are protected under diplomatic privileges.\n\nNetanyahu chose to stay silent and made no excuse for the attack on the Syria-based command post of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard that supports Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIsrael's war in Gaza has developed into a huge tragedy, killing more than 38,000 people in nine months, and has come under intense criticism from the international public.\n\nBy attacking the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, Netanyahu apparently wanted to soften international criticism by emphasizing the fact that the presence of Hezbollah, Iran's proxy force in Lebanon, had forced about 60,000 Israelis to become internally displaced.\n\nTo attack targets in Israel, Iran unleashed a barrage of missiles and drones from its home territory on April 13 without relying on its proxy network, including Hezbollah. This was Iran's first bold direct offensive against Israel, a development that would never have been possible without Khamenei's supreme command of Iran's armed forces and his strategic decision.\n\nNetanyahu ordered a retaliatory strike on targets near the Natanz nuclear research facility in central Iran. But the attack was only meant to show off Israel's ability to penetrate Iran's missile-defense system, taking a \"danmari\" attitude to avoid the risk of having tensions escalate into a full-blown war.\n\nWhat has happened to the Iranian and Israel leaders may be called a restrained \"warfare of silence.\" Khamenei must know the words of the 13th-century Persian poet Saadi, who wrote about the advantages of silence. \"The possessor of deliberation, intelligence and shrewdness / Does not say a word till he sees silence,\" Saadi wrote in \"The Golestan\" as translated by Richard Francis Burton.\n\nPresident-elect Pezeshkian's top priority will be to resurrect the 2015 nuclear deal without spoiling the significance of the supreme leader's \"warfare of silence\" strategy on the one hand or giving up Iran's ambition to possess nuclear weapons.\n\nAccording to the May report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran's stockpile of 60% highly enriched uranium -- near weapons-grade -- had already reached 142.1 kilograms, up 20.6 kilograms from February this year. The amount is theoretically enough to produce three nuclear warheads if the material is enriched from 60% to 90%, a process that is technically not difficult.\n\nNonetheless, it cannot definitely be said that Iran is inclined to join the world's nuclear club as soon as possible. To date, Iran has instead used shrewd political means to carefully keep its distance from the dividing line of possessing nuclear weapons while forcing the United States and other major Western countries, as well as Japan, to make concessions to Iran and bluffing against the United States and Israel with the threat that it will arm itself with nuclear weapons.\n\nThe IAEA reported that this year, Iran has diluted its enriched uranium stockpile by mixing certain amounts of 60% enriched uranium with 2% enriched uranium on two occasions -- in February and May -- to reduce its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium at least for now. This shows how attentive Khamenei is to detail. The next U.S. president, to be chosen in November, will have to deal squarely with such a leader.\n\nKhamenei, hidden in silence and shadows, should be the counterpart of the next U.S. leader, be it Donald Trump or Joe Biden, in pursuing a nuclear agreement and resolving the war in Gaza. President-elect Pezeshkian can never be in that position. This can be said to represent the inscrutable nature of Iran.\n\nMasayuki Yamauchi\n\nYamauchi is a special adviser to Fujitsu Future Studies Center Ltd., where he specializes in Middle Eastern and Islamic area studies and the history of international relations.

Hundreds were killed and thousands arrested as the authorities sought to crush the protests. Reformist Pezeshkian won with 53.7% of the vote, defeating hardliner Saeed Jalili in the run-off polls.\n\nAccording to Iran's interior ministry, over 30 million Iranians voted in the run-off presidential election, higher than the 40% participation in the first round on June 28. The voting time was extended by two hours. However, many videos and photos posted on Iranian social media showed empty polling stations around Iran. Also, various political groups outside Iran gathered in front of the Iranian embassies and consulates and urged the electorate to boycott the election. This presidential election recorded the lowest voter turnout in the Islamic Republic of Iran since 1979. In a speech on June 25, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for a large turnout in the election in an effort to stop the enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Even the prisoners in Saqqez, in western Iran, were compelled to participate in the presidential election. However, many Iranians seem to believe that this election, like many others, was staged and prepared by the entourage of the Supreme Leader and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.\n\nThe new President is a reformist who has never been a serious critic of velayat-e faqih, the theocratic system under which the Supreme Leader has absolute authority. Pezeshkian, born in 1954, in Mahabad in northwestern Iran to an Azeri father and a Kurdish mother, was the health minister during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, but he gained prominence for his stance against the crackdown of the 2022 urban protests. During these protests, he said in an interview with Iran's TV: \"I bear part of the blame, the distinguished religious scholars and the mosques bear part of the blame, and the (Iranian) broadcasting authority bears part of the blame. Everybody should step forward and be held accountable, rather than capture that girl, beat her up, and eventually deliver her body to her family.\" Pezeshkian also aligned himself with the former Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with the US and the European Union. He later served as a deputy parliament speaker and backed the cause of the Iranian moderates.\n\nPezeshkian's win is a way for the Supreme Leader and Iran's Revolutionary Guards to find a solution to Iran's growing legitimacy crisis and the succession battle that will follow 85-year-old Khamenei's eventual passing. Despite the appearances, Khamenei and his hardline allies played in a manner to ensure that the polls produced no surprise and gave the impression that Pezeshkian's victory was difficult to obtain. However, the truth is quite the opposite, since both reformists and the conservatives, who are loyal to the Iranian establishment, feared that a visibly rigged and undemocratic election would leave Iran's rulers totally isolated from a population already tired of the theocratic regime with its tough oppressive laws and economic mismanagement. Versed in the art of regime survival, Iran's leaders smoothly opened the doors of the political system through the election of a moderate President who is also acceptable to the military and paramilitary apparatus. Whatever the future of President Pezeshkian, one thing is clear. The war in Gaza showed the Iranian establishment that Iran's ongoing move to hegemony in West Asia is in urgent need for a back stage United States (US)-Iran diplomacy, especially if the American election in November produces a strong anti-Iran president like Donald Trump.\n\nThis said, the suspicious death of former President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in a helicopter crash leaves the interpretation open to those commentators who rightly believe that the so-called Iranian reformists function only as safety valves for a violent face-to-face encounter between the ultra-conservatives themselves, who represent different camps and try to reshape the Iranian political system in their own way by searching alliances between clerical autocrats and security and military officials. As for the reformists, they hope to have a piece of the cake, in spite of not having been invited to the party. That is why, if Pezeshkian and his \"reformist\" supporters refuse to play it smoothly, the friction between him as an elected President and the entourage of the unelected Supreme Leader will be stronger at every challenge. This balancing act will require from Pezeshkian the unproven skill of moderating the ultra-hardliner's drive for hegemonic power without shutting the door on the face of the absolutist clerics or the warmonger Revolutionary Guards. Is President Pezeshkian witty enough to stop the Revolutionary Guards from intensifying repression at home and confrontation with the US? At a time when Iran and the region are in a potentially disastrous situation, the new president will need the art of complexity management to be able to solve the endless economic problems and an escalating legitimacy crisis of the Islamic Republic of Iran.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Republican nominee and former president vowed to resolve these global crises upon his return to the Oval Office.\n\nTrump also promised to \"end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine -- which would have never happened if I was president -- and the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would have never happened if I was president.\"\n\n\"Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years,\" Trump said.\n\nWhen Trump was president, he withdrew the US from a nuclear deal with Iran that was brokered by the former Obama administration, reimposing harsh economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. Current US President Joe Biden has attempted to restart negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, allowing sanctions waivers which, critics argue, benefit Tehran and allow it to spend more money on supporting terrorism.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2023, for example, the US State Department allowed Iraq to import energy from Iran under the condition that all payments were kept in an escrow account out of the Iranian government's reach. In the summer of 2023, however, the Biden administration changed the sanctions waiver to allow Iraq to transfer $10 billion to Iran.\n\nThe US intelligence community has consistently labeled Iran -- which provides funding, weapons, and training to Hamas -- as the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. Republicans have argued that the Biden administration's decision to ease certain sanctions on Iran will allow the regime to give more support to its terrorist proxies, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran has been ramping up its nuclear program without a nuclear accord in place.\n\n\"Now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also promised to build an Iron Dome air defense system on US soil similar to the one that Israel has.\n\n\"Why should other countries have this and we don't? No, we're going to build an Iron Dome over our country, and we're going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was unclear what threats Trump had in mind to thwart with Iron Dome, which was designed to stop short-range rockets and missiles -- not a danger the US has ever faced along its borders.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

We can say that the big mistake of the 12th administration was that they underestimated the effects of Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA. They should have prevented Trump from withdrawing from the JCPOA so that Iran would not suffer much damage. Now there is no doubt that with the current trend, especially the failed assassination of Trump, he will win the next election. In case of Trump's return, the few hopes for the revival of the JCPOA will disappear. This website believes that now that Trump has not entered the White House and is in a weak position for the future, informal negotiations should be started with him. This is a stupid proposal because negotiating with an irresponsible person, an insane like Trump, lacks the least intellectual and legal validity.\n\nIran: Condemning the criminal \"Trump\" through legal ways\n\nIn an analysis, the Iran newspaper dealt with the denial of the plot to assassinate Trump by Iran. The paper said: Following the assassination attempt against Trump, the American network \"CNN\" claimed that the country's intelligence officials have discovered a possible plan by Iran to kill Trump in recent weeks. But White House security sources have emphasized that no connection has been found between Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old assailant, and Iran's attempt to assassinate Trump. In an expected scenario, a number of American circles tried to link the false claim of the recent attack on Trump to Iran. However, the Iranian authorities denied the false claim of any connection with the assassination of Trump, and they have emphasized that they are pursuing the punishment of this American official for issuing the order to assassinate the Iranian military commander through international legal channels. From the prospect of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who should be tried and punished in court for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani, but Iran has chosen the legal path to condemn him.\n\nJam-e-Jam: Wise communication and far from begging\n\nIn a commentary, Jam-e-Jam discussed the prospect of global interactions with Iranian principles. It wrote: Constructive and effective interaction with the world based on the principles of dignity, wisdom, and expediency is even stated in the vision statement of the Islamic Republic of Iran. On this basis, the Leader of the Revolution has emphasized by notifying this statement that Iran's foreign relations with other countries can only be understood within the framework of these three principles. The Islamic Republic should not act with other countries in a way that ultimately leads to the humiliation of Islamic society. Although the Islamic Republic is based on honesty in its relationship with the West, this honesty is combined with wisdom and rationality and not naivety. Another fundamental basis of Iran's relationship with the world is expediency. It means behind every decision, the expediency of the Islamic world and Muslims should be considered, and begging diplomacy should be avoided, both in words and in content. The Leader explained that \"expediency\" means having flexibility in cases necessary to evade hard obstacles and continue the path.\n\nShargh: The Iranophobia project will subside soon\n\nIn a conversation with Abdolreza Farjirad, a senior analyst of geopolitical issues, Shargh discussed the Iranophobia project. The paper said: The foreign enemies and saboteurs always try to take the most advantage of the smallest incident and anti-Iranian speculation, and therefore, CNN's not-so-credible claim has become an opportunity to accuse Iran of assassinating Trump through political and media abuse. The purpose of such anti-Iranian waves is to influence the policy of Donald Trump vis-a-vis Tehran, because the possible government of the United States, which can be associated with the victory of Donald Trump, will implement a policy and a radical view towards Tehran. The most important issue is that the possible Trump administration and the entire political structure of the United States of America would no longer be deceived by political and media trends against the Islamic Republic of Iran and would not fall into the trap of Iranophobia.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayhan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kayhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Iranian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Iranian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shargh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shargh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Periods_and_Movements/Islamic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Periods and Movements/Islamic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2024/07/19/4/5088376.jpg?ts=1721402841985", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741608", "eventUri": "eng-9741608", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

He emphasized the need for \"peace through strength,\" and contrasted what he says are Trump's realistic policies as opposed to Biden's weaknesses and appeasement.\n\nGingrich specifically warned about Iran, describing it as a religious dictatorship chanting \"death to America\" and nearing nuclear capability. He argued that Biden's policies have failed to address this and other threats, whereas he deemed Trump's firm approach necessary to ensure strength and peace in a \"dangerous world.\"\n\nFormer White House official and 2016 Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway also spoke in Milwaukee touting Trump's achievements such as taking out ISIS leaders al-Baghdadi and the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards' notorious military commander Qassem Soleimani and ending the ISIS caliphate.\n\nConway argued that \"weakness emboldens adversaries,\" underscoring the importance of Trump's strong stance on national security and foreign policy. Addressing those who claim they want Trump's policies without his personality, Conway remarked, \"Good luck with that. We don't get those policies without that personality.\"\n\nOn the point of appeasing Iran, the Biden administration has often countered the accusations by listing what it calls robust sanctions against hundreds of Iranian entities and individuals aimed at curbing Iran's military capabilities and support for terrorism.\n\nJ.D. Vance took to the stage, and officially accepted the nomination as Trump's VP, with his speech primarily focused on his challenging upbringing in Ohio, his military service, and the economy. Vance criticized Biden's policies, arguing they lead to the US being flooded with \"cheap Chinese goods.\"\n\nVance also highlighted what he saw as a failure of President Biden, from open borders to stagnating wages, and insisted allies must share the burden of securing world peace. Trump's running-mate concluded, \"Together, we will send our kids to war only when we must. But as President Trump showed with the elimination of ISIS and so much more, when we punch, we're going to punch hard.\"\n\nFormer Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell's speech criticized what he called \"years of neglecting US priorities\".\n\n\"We spent too many years ignoring US priorities, when Washington stopped being the capital of the US and started being the capital of the world.\" He highlighted that under Trump, historic peace deals were signed in the Middle East, namely the Abraham Accords, and that Iran was economically weakened, and China was challenged.\n\nGrenell also noted there were no new wars and old wars ended. In contrast, under Biden, Russia invaded Ukraine, the Taliban regained power, ISIS members slipped through the southern border, China bullied its neighbors, and Iran waged war in Israel and Gaza with Biden's help.\n\nDemocrats however, have often argued that Trump's \"maximum pressure\" policy on Tehran during his time as President backfired by pushing Iran to ramp up its nuclear program and increasing regional instability. Rather than bringing Iran back to the negotiating table, after Trump exited the Iran nuclear deal, they claim the approach led to heightened tensions and more frequent attacks on US troops by Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.\n\nAdditionally, $16 billion in frozen funds were released to Iran under the Biden administration for reported humanitarian purposes like food and medicine, as critics argue that this indirectly supports Iran's military and proxy activities by freeing up other resources.\n\nYet, Republicans say that the Biden administration's inadequate enforcement of sanctions has pushed Iran's oil sales to soar significantly. Since Biden took office, Iran's oil exports have risen from around 300,000 barrels per day to 1.5 million barrels per day, primarily due to increased sales to China. This increase in oil sales has generated approximately $80 billion for Iran, providing substantial financial resources to support its military and proxy groups across the Middle East, including Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nAnother member of Congress, Nancy Mace, from South Carolina warned that China, which is watching America closely, supports enemy states like Iran which oppresses its own people -- in particular its women.\n\nMichael Waltz, the Congressman from Florida, praised Trump's tenure, stating, \"Under Trump, we had a president who defeated ISIS, broke Iran, stood with Israel, always stood with our allies, made China pay... you didn't see any spy balloons under President Trump, did you? He deterred Russia.\"\n\nWaltz further criticized the current administration's focus on other issues, saying, \"What do we have today... he's focused on pronouns and renaming bases.\"\n\nDr. Ronny Jackson, a congressman from Texas, Navy veteran, and former combat physician in Iraq, also spoke. As Donald Trump's physician, Jackson criticized President Biden's leadership, stating, \"China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran do not respect Joe Biden's 10am - 4pm schedule.\"\n\nHe argued, \"There is simply too much at stake for someone who can barely shuffle to the podium. For the security of the country, every second Biden stays in the White House, the country becomes less safe.\" Jackson asserted that under Trump, America will restore its standing on the world stage.\n\nSeveral military veterans also sharply criticized Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan, with one veteran calling it a \"moral injury\" and describing it as a \"dark chapter\" in American history. They emphasized the chaos and harm caused by the withdrawal, highlighting its negative impact on both the military and the nation's global standing.", "source": {"uri": "iranintl.com", "dataType":

The Iranian mission to the United Nations says these allegations are \"unsubstantiated and malicious,\" but this is what Washington is claiming nonetheless.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nIran's government said in a statement that while the former president is still \"a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law\" for ordering the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in 2020, there are no plans by Iran to assassinate Trump in retaliation.\n\n(Related: Check out this call post-assassination attempt in which Trump discusses vaccine injuries with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.)\n\nThose of us who know the deep state's M.O. will immediately recognize that the likely plan is for the deep state itself to try to assassinate Trump a second time while blaming Iran as the scapegoat.\n\nFor years, Washington has told the world that every bad thing that happens to America is somehow the fault of Russia. Now, the blame game is shifting to Iran as the latest bogeyman.\n\nThe two senior U.S. officials who are claiming all this said the Biden regime has collected information from a number of sources, several of whom are people, on alleged threats from Tehran that point to potentially more physical acts of violence against the U.S. in general, and Trump specifically.\n\nAs usual, neither official agreed to share his or her name publicly. They both did emphatically state that there is no evidence Saturday's shooting at Trump's rally had any connection to Iran.\n\nCNN reported prior to the attempted assassination of Trump by Thomas Matthew Crooks in Butler, Penn., that Iran was planning to kill Trump first.\n\n\"We have repeatedly and consistently briefed the public and Congress on the existence of these threats,\" said NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson. \"We have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response to these threats.\"\n\n\"We have invested extraordinary resources in developing additional information about these threats, disrupting individuals involved in these threats ... and directly warning Iran.\"\n\nThe corporate media is claiming that Iran routinely tries to interfere with U.S. elections by spreading \"misinformation\" via influence campaigns. We have heard again and again from the deep state as well that Iran is supposedly an enemy of U.S. elections.\n\nAvril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, made a rare public statement on July 9 about Iran's alleged involvement in the U.S. protests related to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\n\"Iranian government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza, using a playbook we've seen other actors use over the years,\" Haines said.\n\n\"We have observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters.\"", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_within_a_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State within a state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Masoud Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old cardiac surgeon, former health minister, and current Member of Parliament, won 53% of the vote in a runoff election in Iran.\n\nPezeshkian is open to a new relationship with the US, but any policy change will have to wait until the outcome of the US election in November. Similarly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is waiting for the outcome of the US election.\n\n\"I have come \" to seek lasting peace and tranquility and cooperation in the region, as well as dialogue and constructive interaction with the world,\" Pezeshkian said in a speech.\n\nRegardless of which candidate will be elected, they will be a supporter of Israel. President Donald Trump will remember in his 2020 election race Netanyahu stabbed him in the back, and came out publically in support of Joe Biden, even though Trump had done more for Israel than any previous US president.\n\n\"I haven't spoken to him since,\" Trump said in an interview with Axios' Barak Ravid in December 2021, in reference to Netanyahu. \"F**k him,\" he said.\n\nIsrael keeps Iran as their designated 'Enemy Number One'. Regardless of leadership change, or international diplomacy, Iran is destined to remain the bad guy in the Israeli drama.\n\nThe US has a similar policy, which is designed to keep the American public in fear of something foreign. At one time, Americans were afraid of Al Qaeda, and then it morphed into ISIS. Putin has taken the place of the enemy as portrayed in the Biden-controlled US media.\n\nPezeshkian has been a member of parliament since 2008, representing Tabriz in northwestern Iran. His father is of Turkic descent, while his mother is Kurdish. Pezeshkian grew up speaking Turkic, Kurdish, and Farsi. Some analysts see Pezeshkian as a moderating force who may sympathize with minorities.\n\nAccording to Netanyahu, Iran seeks to develop a nuclear bomb with which to 'nuke' Israel into non-existence. According to the Iranian supreme leadership, Iran wants nuclear ability to have a source of electricity, rather than polluting the environment by burning fossil fuels.\n\nSaudi Arabia, a close US ally and US-made weapons customer, also has told the US administration they will pursue building a nuclear power plant, which is common in many Western countries. The US will allow the Saudis their nuclear project, but in exchange for signing the Abraham Accords, which will normalize diplomatic relations with Israel. Experts view Saudi Arabia as the powerhouse in the Middle East, and signing a deal with Israel has been one of the two main goals of Netanyahu since taking office. His second goal is to expand the illegal settlements in the West Bank, effectively annexing the land. The Gaza War has put normalization plans on hold as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has reiterated the official Saudi position rejecting the occupation of Palestine and demanding a two-state solution.\n\nIran and Hezbollah, and others in the resistance movement are demanding the end of the occupation of Palestine. If Israel would negotiate a final peace deal with the Palestinian people, there would be no armed resistance. In theory, the UN, the US, the UK, and almost every country have agreed that the UN resolution for a two-state solution should be implemented as soon as possible. That peace deal would mark the end of violence against Israel, and both Israelis and Palestinians could live in peace, and with human rights.\n\nPezeshkian signaled there would be no change in Iran's backing of Hezbollah, whose attacks since Oct. 7 have raised the specter of a wider war in the region. He wrote to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah that \"support for resistance groups will continue vigorously.\"\n\nBut, Netanyahu's extremist government has said they will never give one inch of land to the Palestinians, and instead want to keep Gaza under military occupation forever and continue to hold the 3 million Palestinians in the Occupied West Bank under an iron-fist rule which is designed never to end.\n\nThe US has a two-faced policy on Israel. On the one hand, the US President says they are committed to a two-state solution, and on the other hand, he is sending Israel all the weapons they request to keep the genocide going in Gaza. On April 20, the House passed a bill to provide $26.3 billion in assistance to Israel. This split personality is due to AIPAC. From the White House to Capitol Hill, every politician knows their political career depends on bowing down to AIPAC.\n\nThe White House, regardless of its occupant, will have the opportunity to see whether a serious diplomatic process containing the nuclear issue and de-escalation is possible with the Pezeshkian leadership.", "source": {"uri": "opednews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, Trump, Pompeo, and McKenzie need to be killed,\" he added, as reported by Asre Iran and Tasnim.\n\nAhmad Hamzeh, a member of the Iranian parliament, announced during a session that \"on behalf of the people of Kerman, we offer a three-million-dollar cash reward to anyone who kills Trump,\" (semi-official ISNA news agency, January 21, 2020). Following a 2022 assassination attempt on novelist Salman Rushdie, the Kayhan newspaper, echoing Khamenei's rhetoric, stated, \"Taking revenge on the perpetrators and criminals on American soil is not difficult and, after this, Trump and Pompeo will feel increasingly threatened\" (Kayhan newspaper, August 12, 2023).\n\nNumerous other threats were issued by high-ranking officials of the Iranian regime, vowing severe retribution for the killing of Qasem Soleimani, described as the architect of terrorism in the Middle East.\n\nWhile there is no direct evidence linking Khamenei's threats to the July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, it is evident that terrorism has long been a tactic used to further the coercive policies of this religious dictatorship.\n\nConsider, a few months prior to Hamas's assault on Israel, Khamenei proclaimed during his Iranian New Year speech that \"we will stay on the line of resistance,\" which was followed by Hamas's attacks on Israel and the subsequent bombing of Gaza, resulting in the deaths of approximately forty thousand Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nMoreover, before the failed assassination attempt on Alejo Vidal-Quadras, former vice president of the European Parliament and president of the International Committee in Search of Justice on November 9, 2023, the theocratic regime of Iran had already placed him on their foreign ministry's sanctions list. Immediately after surviving the attempt, and before being transferred to the hospital, unable to speak due to a bullet wound to his lower jaw, he managed to communicate to the police via his phone that the Iranian regime was his only adversary.\n\nFurther investigations revealed that the orchestrator of this crime had connections back to Iran. The fugitive assailant, a French national, had been hired for the assassination. Recently, an Iranian woman was arrested in the Netherlands, accused of financing this assassination attempt. According to a report from the Frankfurter Allgemeine two days ago, the Iranian regime employs criminal organizations to carry out its assassinations.\n\nThe Religious Dictator at a Complete Deadlock\n\nAmidst a series of failures both within Iran and on the international stage, Khamenei finds himself in dire need of demonstrating power more than ever before to sustain his domestic forces and regional proxies. In the recent presidential elections, despite Khamenei's desperate pleas and various coercive tactics, voter turnout was meager, with perhaps only about 10 percent participation. This low turnout reflects a widespread boycott of the elections in Iran, the regime's failure in its repression efforts, and the increasing strength -- both in numbers and impact -- of resistance units. Thousands of these units, affiliated with the People's Mujahedin of Iran (the central force of the democratic alternative NCRI), managed to disrupt the regime's electoral process with twenty thousand promotional operations within just one month. Khamenei is acutely aware that this organized force could ignite a significant uprising that would threaten his rule.\n\nNikki Haley, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and presidential candidate pinpointed the Iranian regime as the root cause of myriad issues in the Middle East during her speech on July 17 at the Republican National Convention, stating, \"Look at the Middle East, every issue in this region traces back to the Islamic Republic. The Iranian dictatorship is bankrolling and arming groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.\"\n\nOn June 29, at the Free Iran 2024 World Summit held in Paris, France, former Vice President Mike Pence delivered an impassioned speech, highlighting the resilience and strength of the Iranian resistance movement.\n\n\"One of the biggest lies the ruling regime sold to the wider world is that there is no alternative to the status quo. But you all know there is an alternative, well-organized, fully prepared, perfectly qualified, and popularly supported alternative called the National Council of Resistance of Iran, whose main component is called the MEK,\" Pence said. \"Please join me in thanking Maryam Rajavi for your outstanding leadership. Mrs. Rajavi's Ten-Point Plan for the future of Iran will extend political, social, and economic equality to women. It will allow all citizens to prosper and thrive in a free market economy. The Ten-Point Plan will ensure the freedom of expression, the freedom of assembly, and guarantee the right of every Iranian to live, to work, to worship, according to the dictates of their conscience in freedom\".\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years,\" he added, saying the Biden administration has provided Tehran sanctions relief.\n\n\"I told China and other countries, if you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business in this country.\"\n\nHe repeated his claim that Iran was on the verge of agreeing to negotiate a new deal to more strictly curb its nuclear program before Trump lost the 2020 election.\n\n\"Iran was going to make a deal with us, and then we had that horrible, horrible result that we will never let happen again,\" the former president said.\n\n\"Now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened.\"\n\nSince the collapse of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers following Trump's unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, Tehran has pursued nuclear enrichment to just below weapons-grade levels.\n\nWestern powers say there is no credible civilian reason for that. Iran says its aims are entirely peaceful but officials have recently said it could change its \"nuclear doctrine\" if it is attacked or its existence is seen as threatened by Israel. That has prompted alarm at the International Atomic Energy Agency and in Western capitals.\n\nTrump again pledged to build an Iron Dome missile defense system for the United States akin to the one Israel has.\n\n\"Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system. Three-hundred and forty-two missiles were shot into Israel, and only one got through a little bit,\" Trump said in an apparent reference to Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel in April.\n\n\"Why should other countries have this and we don't? No, we're going to build an Iron Dome over our country and we're going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people,\" he added.\n\nIt was not clear what threat Trump is trying to thwart, as Iron Dome is only capable of intercepting short-range rockets -- not a danger the US has ever faced along its borders.\n\nSurviving assassination\n\nTrump also described how he narrowly survived the attempt on his life, telling a rapt audience in his first speech since the attack that he was only there \"by the grace of Almighty God.\"\n\n\"I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear,\" he said in Milwaukee, a thick bandage still covering his ear. \"I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.\"\n\nThe former president struck an unusually conciliatory tone during the speech's opening moments when he formally accepted the party's presidential nomination.\n\n\"I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America because there is no victory in winning for half of America,\" he said, in a marked shift in tenor for the typically bellicose former president.\n\nHe paid tribute to Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who was fatally shot during the assassination attempt, kissing the helmet of his uniform that was placed on stage.\n\nAs he has done throughout his political career, Trump argued that only he can save a dwindling nation from certain doom.\n\nThe address marked the climax and conclusion of a massive four-day Republican pep rally that drew thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to swing-state Wisconsin as voters weigh an election that currently features two deeply unpopular candidates.\n\nBiden campaign denounces his role in Jan. 6 riot\n\n\"Tonight, Donald Trump rambled on for well over an hour and failed to mention Project 2025 even once,\" the Biden-Harris campaign said in a statement, referencing a collection of policy proposals by conservative activists to consolidate power in Trump's hands if he wins office.\n\nThe campaign slammed Trump for failing to mention his role in the US Supreme Court's overturning of the constitutionally protected right to abortion, the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, and for policies that \"destroyed our economy.\"\n\n\"President [Joe] Biden is running on a different vision. He's running for an America where we defend democracy, not diminish it,\" the campaign said.\n\nThe GOP convention's program of speakers reflected the nominee's background as a reality television star -- the primetime list featured mixed martial arts executive Dana White, the rapper and singer Kid Rock, and the pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, who fired up the crowd by tearing his top off to reveal a sleeveless red Trump campaign shirt.\n\nHis entrance was befitting of a TV star or a pro wrestler -- a screen lifted slowly to reveal Trump standing in front of massive lights arranged to spell out his last name before an image of the White House was projected behind him.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden, Trump's opponent in the November 5 election, was \"soul searching\" about whether to drop out of the race entirely, one source said, after senior party figures, congressional allies and major donors warned him he could not win following a halting debate performance on June 27.\n\nBiden, 81, was isolating at his Delaware home after contracting COVID-19. His doctor said he was experiencing mild symptoms.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "donald_trump@timesofisrael.com",

Hossein Hajizadeh, commander of the Aerospace Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, listed on the U.S. terror blacklist, stated: \"God willing, we will be able to kill Trump and Pompeo. That night (during the missile attack on the Ain al-Assad base in Iraq), we could have killed a thousand Americans if we had wanted to, but they were just soldiers, and it would not have mattered. However, Trump, Pompeo, and McKenzie need to be killed,\" as reported by the Tasnim News Agency, Iran's semi-official news agency associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nAhmad Hamzeh, a member of parliament, announced during a public session of the parliament that \"on behalf of the people of Kerman, we offer a three-million-dollar cash reward to anyone who kills Trump,\" reported the semi-official ISNA news agency on Jan. 21, 2020.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nAfter a 2022 assassination attempt in New York on novelist Salman Rushdie - the longtime object of Iranian assassination threats and fatwas going back to the 1988 publication of his book \"The Satanic Verses\" - the Kayhan newspaper, which publishes Ali Khamenei's positions, noted that \"taking revenge on the perpetrators and criminals on American soil is not difficult and after this [attempted assassination of Rushdie], Trump and Pompeo will feel more threatened.\" Many other threats have been made against Trump by the highest officials of the Iranian regime, speaking of severe revenge for Trump's killing of Qasem Soleimani, a key architect of terrorism in the Middle East.\n\nBefore the failed assassination attempt on Alejo Vidal-Quadras, former vice president of the European Parliament and president of the International Committee in Search of Justice on Nov. 9, 2023, the theocratic regime of Iran had placed him on the foreign ministry's sanctions list. Immediately after the attempt on his life, and before being transferred to the hospital while unable to speak due to a bullet hitting his lower jaw, he communicated with the police by writing on his cellphone that his only enemy was the Iranian regime. Subsequent investigations showed that the mastermind of this crime was indeed traceable back to Iran. The fugitive criminal had been hired to assassinate Vidal-Quadras.\n\nRecently, an Iranian woman was arrested in the Netherlands for financing this assassination attempt. The German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine reported this week that the Iranian regime uses \"criminal organizations for its assassinations.\"\n\nIn the midst of successive failures both within Iran and on the international stage, Khamenei is more in need of showcasing power than ever before to maintain his forces domestically and his proxy forces in the wider region. In the recent presidential elections, despite Khamenei's pleas and various coercions, only about 10% participated in the voting, a turnout that reflects essentially a boycott within Iran, the regime's unparalleled failure at suppression of opposition, and the growing quantitative and qualitative strength of the resistance units. Indeed, thousands of resistance units belonging to the People's Mujahedin of Iran - the core force of the democratic alternative, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, or NCRI - managed to bring the regime's elections to a boycott with 20,000 promotional operations within just one month. Khamenei is well aware that this organized force could spark a major uprising that would make his downfall a real possibility.\n\nOn June 29, at the Free Iran 2024 World Summit held in Paris, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered an inspiring speech, emphasizing the need for international support for the Iranian resistance movement.\n\n\"You all continue to be persecuted and prosecuted, and frankly, Western nations aren't doing enough to support your efforts. But I'm counting on the courageous men and women, some of whom I've had the chance to meet, who have become a nightmare for the regime. They will force change. They will obtain change. They force an offering to a brighter future for the people of Iran ... Madam Rajavi, the Ten-Point Plan you have put forward is the solution. That day will come when it shatters the theocracy. It will break them to the very core. And the very leaders who are inflicting so much pain on the Iranian people today will be held accountable for all that they have done.\"\n\nAnd Nikki Haley, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and one-time presidential candidate, in her July 17 speech at the Republican National Convention, identified the Iranian regime as the primary cause of all the problems in the Middle East, saying: \"Look at the Middle East. Every problem in that part of the world can be laid at the feet of Iran. The dictator to chant death to America are the bankrollers and weapons suppliers for Hamas and Hezbollah. They're behind the barbaric massacres and the hostage taking. Once again, compare Trump and Biden. Trump got us out of the insane Iran nuclear deal.\"\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

On that night (during the missile strike on the Ain al-Assad base in Iraq), we could have killed a thousand Americans if we had wanted to, but they were just soldiers, and it wouldn't have made a difference.

Following an assassination attempt on Rushdie, the Kayhan newspaper, echoing Khamenei's rhetoric, stated, \"Taking revenge on the perpetrators and criminals on American soil is not difficult and, after this, Trump and Pompeo will feel increasingly threatened\" (Kayhan newspaper, August 12, 2023). Numerous other threats were issued by high-ranking officials of the Iranian regime, vowing severe retribution for the killing of Qasem Soleimani, described as the architect of terrorism in the Middle East.\n\nWhile there is no direct evidence linking Khamenei's threats to the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump, it is evident that terrorism has long been a tactic used to further the coercive policies of this religious dictatorship.\n\nConsider, a few months prior to Hamas's assault on Israel, Khamenei proclaimed during his Iranian New Year speech that \"we will stay on the line of resistance,\" which was followed by Hamas's attacks on Israel and the subsequent bombing of Gaza, resulting in the deaths of approximately forty thousand Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nMoreover, before the failed assassination attempt on Alejo Vidal-Quadras, former Vice-President of the European Parliament and President of the International Committee in Search of Justice on November 9, 2023, the theocratic regime of Iran had already placed him on their foreign ministry's sanctions list. Immediately after surviving the attempt, and before being transferred to the hospital, unable to speak due to a bullet wound to his lower jaw, he managed to communicate to the police via his phone that the Iranian regime was his only adversary. Further investigations revealed that the orchestrator of this crime had connections back to Iran. The fugitive assailant, a French national, had been hired for the assassination. Recently, an Iranian woman was arrested in the Netherlands, accused of financing this assassination attempt. According to a report from the Frankfurter Allgemeine two days ago, the Iranian regime employs criminal organizations to carry out its assassinations.\n\nThe Religious Dictator at a Complete Deadlock\n\nAmidst a series of failures both within Iran and on the international stage, Khamenei finds himself in dire need of demonstrating power more than ever before, to sustain his domestic forces and regional proxies. In the recent presidential elections, despite Khamenei's desperate pleas and various coercive tactics, voter turnout was meager, with perhaps only about 10 percent participation. This low turnout reflects a widespread boycott of the elections in Iran, the regime's failure in its repression efforts, and the increasing strength -- both in numbers and impact -- of resistance units. Thousands of these units, affiliated with the People's Mujahedin of Iran (the central force of the democratic alternative NCRI), managed to disrupt the regime's electoral process with twenty thousand promotional operations within just one month. Khamenei is acutely aware that this organized force could ignite a significant uprising that would threaten his rule.\n\nNikki Haley, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and a presidential candidate, pinpointed the Iranian regime as the root cause of myriad issues in the Middle East during her speech on July 17 at the Republican Party convention, stating, \"Look at the Middle East, every issue in this region traces back to the Islamic Republic. The Iranian dictatorship is bankrolling and arming groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.\"\n\nOn June 29, at the Free Iran 2024 World Summit held in Paris, France, former Vice President Mike Pence delivered an impassioned speech, highlighting the resilience and strength of the Iranian resistance movement: \"One of the biggest lies the ruling regime sold to the wider world is that there is no alternative to the status quo. But you all know there is an alternative, well-organized, fully prepared, perfectly qualified, and popularly supported alternative called the National Council of Resistance of Iran, whose main component is called the MEK. Please join me in thanking Maryam Rajavi for your outstanding leadership. Mrs. Rajavi's Ten-Point Plan for the future of Iran will extend political, social, and economic equality to women. It will allow all citizens to prosper and thrive in a free market economy. The Ten-Point Plan will ensure the freedom of expression, the freedom of assembly, and guarantee the right of every Iranian to live, to work, to worship, according to the dictates of their conscience

It's a hard fact. Even his most fervent supporters have concluded, after his dismal debate performance, that he is unfit to run his campaign and are pleading with him to get out of the race.\n\nBut if he's mentally unfit to run a campaign, why is he not mentally unfit to run a country?\n\nI get that the top priority of Democrats is to find a candidate who can beat Trump in November, but what about the interest of the country until then?\n\nFor that matter, why are we not asking what price the country has paid and is paying for Biden's obvious decline?\n\nOne hot issue that comes to mind is how Biden has dealt with Iran, the world's #1 sponsor of terror.\n\nWe know that in September of last year, Biden unfroze $6 billion in Iranian oil revenues as part of a prisoner swap deal. We also know that since then, Iran has been accelerating its attacks on Israel through its proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen and Iraq.\n\nAnd now we learn that the mullahs have brought their horror show to the Great Satan, America.\n\nAccording to a July 9 statement from Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines:\n\n\"Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions, as we have seen them do in the past, including in prior election cycles. They continue to adapt their cyber and influence activities, using social media platforms and issuing threats. It is likely they will continue to rely on their intelligence services in these efforts, as well as Iran-based online influencers, to promote their narratives.\"\n\nAnd just as Iran loves to target the Jews in the Jewish state, it is just as eager to target the Jews in America:\n\n\"In recent weeks, Iranian government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza, using a playbook we've seen other actors use over the years,\" according to the July 9 statement. \"We have observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters.\"\n\nIt's impossible not to connect the dots: Biden unfreezes $9 billion to a terror regime and that regime accelerates what it does best -- wreak havoc.\n\nWould a fully present president Biden have shown such deference and generosity to such an evil actor? It's hard to say. But Biden's reaction to the assassination attempt against Donald Trump gives us a clue.\n\n\"The idea, the idea that there's political violence or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's not appropriate,\" the president said.\n\nBut Mr. President, do you not realize the kind of political violence Iran is sowing right here in America, under your very nose, as reported by your own Director of National Intelligence?\n\nMaybe a sharper Biden would have realized that political violence in America is hardly \"unheard of,\" and would have been much tougher with Iran. Beyond Iran, are there other examples of the possible impact of his mental decline? This is a democracy -- our leaders report to us. We have the right to ask these questions and demand accountability, because we are the ones who ultimately pay the price.\n\nI feel for Biden. The man's got the toughest job in the world. But his own people are telling us he's not fit to run for office.", "source": {"uri": "jewishjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_suissa@jewishjournal.com", "name": "David Suissa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Haines", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avril Haines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_National_Intelligence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of National Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/suissa-biden-run-country.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741608", "eventUri": "eng-9741608", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 1107, "textEnd": 1113, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

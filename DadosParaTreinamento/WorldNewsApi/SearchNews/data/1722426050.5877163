Schalk, 39, said he has always wanted to build the world\u2019s longest bike. \u201cI have been thinking about this idea for years. I once received a Guinness World Records book and discovered this record,\u201d he ex-plained. Schalk, who has built carnival floats before, finally set out to make his dream a reality, enlisting the help of fellow Prinsenbeek residents Joost Sweep, Jimmy Vermeeren, Sander Vissers, Bas Zuidema, Stef-fie van de Riet, Daan Husson, Toine Kleemans, Jasper Korving, and Op De Beek Hebben We De Langste. \u201cPrinsenbeek is known for its vol-unteers and high technical employ-ability,\u201d Schalk explained. \u201cYou can sit in front of the television, but we do not do that here in Prinsenbeek. We have the technical knowledge and want to use it to the fullest.\u201d Schalk stated that designing and building the bike was a lengthy process that was postponed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team finally broke the record by riding their 180-foot, 11-inch bicy-cle for 100 metres (328 feet), with one member operating the handlebars in the front and another pedalling in the back. The team then broke the world re-cord for the longest tandem bicycle by incorporating additional pedals and team members. \u201cWe left nothing to chance in terms of safety,\u201d Schalk explained. \u201cYou can see this, for example, in the fact that the cyclists are inside rather than outside the structure.\u201d The bicycle is currently on dis-play at Prinsenbeek\u2019s local history museum.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"279\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/8-8.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div>Netherlands man, Ivan Schalk, assembled his team of engineering ex\u00adperts to achieve a lifelong dream of building the world&#8217;s lon\u00adgest bicycle, which measures 180 feet and 11 inches long.

Since cases were confirmed in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas in late March, 33 farms in eight states have identified cases.\n\nThe new order is part of a slate of measures the government is taking to address H5N1 flu, which has been devastating to bird populations and recently begun to infect an increasing number of mammals, potentially bringing it a step closer to being able to spread efficiently between people.\n\nThe USDA said at a multiagency news conference Wednesday that the new order would help it get more information on the growing outbreak.\n\n\"There has been a little bit of reluctance for some of the producers to allow us to gather information from their farms,\" said Dr. Michael Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or APHIS.\n\n\"With the federal order going into place, this is going to really help us address any gaps that might exist.\"\n\nThe order will require that dairy cattle moving between states be tested for avian flu or any type of influenza A before they can travel. No dairy cattle positive for avian flu may move between states without conditions specified by APHIS, Watson said.\n\nRight now, the order doesn't apply to cattle raised as beef, but the USDA said that could change as it learns more about how the virus is spreading. Experts currently believe the virus is being spread through infected milk.\n\nWatson said the order also gives the government the authority to go to a facility where cattle have tested positive and follow up with additional testing and investigation if needed.\n\n\"Requiring a positive test reporting will help USDA better understand the disease, and testing before interstate movement will limit the spread of the virus,\" he said.\n\nThe tests have to be sent to a lab, and it could take several days to get results, Watson said, but the government is working on developing rapid tests that could give results more quickly on the farm.\n\nThe order says the US government will pay for the cost of testing for H5N1 for farms, even if animals don't have symptoms.\n\nThe H5N1 virus spreading in cows has not been shown to spread from person to person, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the public health risk is low. Only one person, a farmworker in Texas, has tested positive in connection to the outbreak. The CDC says 22 other people have been tested for the virus, and states are monitoring 44 others who were considered exposed and at risk of infection.\n\nThe CDC said it is looking into the possibility of monitoring wastewater for the virus, but many farms are not on municipal systems, and there are questions about whether contamination from birds or other infected wildlife might make the results unusable.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it had picked up traces of genetic material from the virus in milk from grocery store shelves.\n\nThe FDA and the CDC have long warned against the dangers of drinking raw or unpasteurized milk because of the possibility that it may carry dangerous germs.\n\nThe FDA doesn't believe that pasteurized dairy products can lead to infections, but it's running confirmatory tests to make sure.\n\n\"We anticipate results from those studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,\" Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said during Wednesday's news conference.\n\nPrater declined to say where the milk that showed traces of the virus had been purchased or how widespread the outbreak might be.\n\n\"We don't have information yet to share, but it will be coming out very shortly,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brenda_goodman@cnn.com",

Here's Why", "body": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand -- and stop -- the growing outbreak.\n\nSo far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people.\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnantshave been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested -- with negative results -- before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nWhy is this outbreak so unusual?\n\nThis strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska.\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants -- goats and then dairy cows -- in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.\n\n\"When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nFlu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.\n\nHow long has bird flu been spreading in cows?\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.\n\nFinding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \"suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\" said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.\n\nThe data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.\n\nSince then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nAnd then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\" Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\"\n\nWhat do scientists say about efforts to track the outbreak?\n\nSeveral experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.\n\n\"We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.\n\n\"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nMore testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\"\n\nHow big a risk does bird flu pose for people?\n\nScientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nAlso, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.\n\nSo far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nWhat are scientists concerns for the future?\n\nDavid O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.\n\n\"There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we're not there,\" he said. As with a tornado watch, \"you wouldn't change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.\"\n\nWorobey said this is the kind of outbreak \"that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.\"\n\nHe said ambitious screening is needed \"to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@time.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquatic mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor_seal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harbor seal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porpoise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polar bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Arizona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bird-flu.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday, the FDA said that, in order to identify where the contaminated milk was found, it was conducting a nationwide survey of commercially sold milk and would release its results in the coming days.\n\nWhen the outbreak was first detected at the end of March, in an effort to keep the milk supply safe, farmers were instructed to discard the milk of sick cows, Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said during a joint media briefing Wednesday.\n\nFarmers were also told by the USDA to test symptomatic cows.\n\nThe discovery of the virus in the commercial milk supply, however, indicates those approaches weren't enough.\n\nIt's unclear how the new mandate might curb the spread of the virus -- a strain of the bird flu called H5N1 -- among the nation's cattle. The virus has already been detected in dairy cows in eight states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas.\n\nA big question for scientists now is, how long has it been going on and where else has it spread?\n\n\"I think it's safe to say that it's longer and much more extensive that has been realized,\" said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and former professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe outbreak concerns scientists and public health officials because H5N1 can be especially deadly in people. However, once in people, the virus doesn't spread easily.\n\nDr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during the media briefing that there's no indication that the H5N1 flu strain is causing any uptick in illness among people or poses an immediate danger to the public.\n\n\"CDC has not identified any out-of-the-ordinary influenza-related emergency department visits, even when we compare areas where H5N1 has spread among cattle against areas where it has not,\" Shah said.\n\nOne person, a dairy worker in Texas, was infected earlier this month. The CDC said that the case was mild and the worker developed conjunctivitis, or pink eye.\n\nShah noted that another 44 people are being \"actively monitored,\" for illness.\n\nIn addition to testing dairy cows before transporting them, Wednesday's order also requires that state veterinary labs report any positive tests to federal health authorities.\n\n\"If [the cows] end up testing positive, they will have a 30-day waiting period before they could move and have to be tested again,\" Mike Watson, administrator for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said during the media briefing.\n\nThe worry is not whether people can catch the flu by drinking milk. The U.S. milk supply undergoes a mandatory pasteurization process, heating milk to a point where any bacteria or virus should be killed.\n\nThough the FDA has not completed studies specifically looking at whether pasteurization kills the virus that causes bird flu, the agency said on Tuesday that, \"to date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\nThe FDA plans to release results of studies looking at pasteurization's effects on the bird flu virus in the coming days or weeks.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erika_edwards@aol.com", "name": "Erika Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_T.H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard T.H.

Also, the identification of virus fragments in finished milk suggests that the virus may be more widespread in dairy cows than currently known.\n\nAt a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) media briefing today, Michael Watson, PhD, administrator of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the new testing order -- which will increase information available to the USDA -- also requires labs to report the H5N1 test findings to federal officials. Positive cows must be held for 30 days before they are moved.\n\nWatson said he expects the testing will help shed light on the extent of virus circulation in asymptomatic cows and fill other information gaps.\n\nFor now, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which has 50 labs, has enough capacity and materials for testing and can conduct tens of thousands of tests per day, he added, noting that testing takes about 1 to 3 days. Scientists are developing a field test that producers can use on farms.\n\nWe continue to ask for producer cooperation to ensure the confidence of Americans and to keep Americans safe.\n\nWatson said so far there are no changes to the virus circulating in cows that would make it more transmissible to humans and that the risk to the public remains low.\n\nWatson shared a few new details about the situation in cows, including that one sample from a cow in Kansas showed a genetic shift that suggests adaptation. And though cows sickened by H5N1 have shown little to no mortality, lung samples from a culled dairy cow yielded H5N1.\n\n\"We continue to ask for producer cooperation to ensure the confidence of Americans and to keep Americans safe,\" he said.\n\nDonald Prater, DVM, acting director of the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), emphasized that despite test findings released yesterday, the nation's milk supply remains safe.\n\nThough health officials feel confident that current pasteurization processes inactivate H5N1, based on what's known in the scientific literature about flu viruses and other pathogens, testing is under way to gauge the specific impacts of H5N1 in milk and other dairy products such as cream.\n\nHe also noted that heat inactivation processes for eggs, which involve lower temperatures than pasteurization, has been successful in preventing the spread of H5N1 from food to people.\n\nPrater said the FDA is conducting tests on milk samples that yielded H5N1 fragments to assess if the products contain live virus, which would pose a larger threat. Those test methods take more time and involve egg inoculation and cell culture.\n\nFederal health officials today noted that the virus remnants were found in tests by the FDA and in a smaller number of milk samples tested by scientists with the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) Network.\n\nWhen pressed to share details on the geographic location of the positive milk samples, Prater said the FDA is conducting a nationwide survey and will release the results in the days ahead.\n\nA senior official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told reporters that 44 people exposed to infected cattle have been tested, and so far, just one person has tested positive, the previously mentioned patient from Texas.\n\nHe added that the CDC's foodborne illness division hasn't detected any concerning activity linked to milk and that surveillance activity, including in areas near affected farms, has shown no unusual trends.\n\nRegarding preparedness, Dawn O'Connell, JD, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, said states can request personal protective equipment (PPE) from the federal government to supplement their own stockpiles. She added that the federal government has millions of doses of antivirals in the Strategic National Stockpile. The CDC recently said its testing found that the virus is susceptible to currently approved neuraminidase inhibitors.\n\nThere's not currently a need to ramp up [vaccine production].\n\nTwo candidate virus vaccine strains against H5N1 developed earlier by the CDC appear to be well matched to the circulating strain, and she said hundreds of thousands of doses could be made in a matter of a week.",

Milk from infected cows is thrown out.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSo far there is no indication that the virus is circulating in dairy cattle in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency has said that it is monitoring the situation closely. Dairy farmers are being asked to watch their cows for signs of the virus and to contact their vet if they suspect a case.\n\nThere has also been no suggestion that the presence of virus fragments in pasteurized milk presents a danger. Scientists have said that pasteurization will kill the virus in milk.\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" said the FDA in a release on Tuesday. \"Results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks.\"\n\nHowever, the presence of virus fragments could mean that transmission of bird flu in dairy cattle began months before it was discovered in late March.\n\nThe \"logical conclusion is that this has -- at least in dairy cattle in the United States -- been going on for quite some time,\" said Dr. Allison McGeer, a clinician scientist at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Sinai Health. \"And is more widespread than we think.\"\n\nBut McGeer noted that it's difficult to judge the extent of transmission because the FDA didn't divulge in its press release how much of the virus was found in pasteurized milk, in how many samples, or where the samples were from.\n\n\"It could be that they tested pasteurized milk from a known batch at one of the farms that has had a lot of infections,\" said McGeer, who is a member of the infection control subcommittee of the Ontario Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee. \"That's very different from, they went out and bought commercial milk in some state that had no recognized infections.\"\n\nAvian flu was first detected in dairy cattle in the U.S. on March 25, after an outbreak in numerous states was discovered.\n\nThe virus, which is carried by wild birds, has been responsible for the culling in recent years of millions of domestic poultry, both in Canada and the U.S., because the virus is highly pathogenic in chickens and turkeys.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt has also killed a number of wild animals, including seals, bears, foxes and skunks, animals that may have contracted the virus by eating infected birds.\n\nThis is the first time that the virus has spread to cows.\n\n\"The reason that we didn't find H5N1 in cows in the United States until it has been around for months, is because when cows get sick, there's a whole lot of viruses that cause illness in cows. But influenza generally doesn't,\" said McGeer. \"So it took a while,\" she said, until \"a smart person decided to look.\"\n\nHPAI has also been found in an asymptomatic dairy cow that was culled, due to illness or reduced milk production, from an affected herd and which did not enter the food supply, according to the USDA.\n\nA farm worker in Texas has also been infected, but the case was mild.\n\nScott Weese, a veterinarian and professor at the University of Guelph, has said that so far, samples from respiratory secretions of cows have rarely tested positive for the virus, whereas the milk seems to have a lot of virus in it, which could point to the virus being passed through milking equipment that is being used on multiple animals on dairy farms.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com",

Health officials said that these fragments of virus do not indicate that the milk contains live virus and that they have \"seen nothing that would change our assessment\" that the supply is safe.\n\nDonald Prater, acting director of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said: \"We take the current situation very seriously. Based on information currently available, we believe our commercial milk is safe.\"\n\nThe new federal order requires every lactating cow to be tested and post a negative result before moving to a new state.\n\nMichael Watson, an administrator with the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said that laboratories have the capacity for performing \"tens of thousands of tests a day\".\n\nUntil now, testing was done voluntarily and only in cows with symptoms, but FDA officials suggested that some producers had not been fully cooperative with allowing testing in their herds. Under the new rules, positive tests will trigger additional requirements for officials to investigate, milk from affected cows would be dumped and cows that test positive would be kept in situ for 30 days before being retested.\n\nOfficials also gave more detailed information about investigations into the potential for milk to contain infectious virus. Genetic traces of H5N1 were found in commercially bought milk in PCR tests. But these tests detect both live and dead virus fragments.\n\nPasteurisation is designed to kill off the most robust bacteria and viruses, so would be expected to do the same for avian flu, but further tests are needed to confirm this is the case. The FDA said it has been trying to see if it could grow virus from milk found to contain evidence of H5N1, which is the gold standard test to see if there is viable virus in a product.\n\n\"Pasteurisation is very likely to inactivate viruses like H5N1,\" said Prater, adding that it is a \"new and evolving\" situation.\n\nThe outbreak, which has spread to herds across eight states, has prompted concern because it is the first time bird flu has spread between cows, and transmission between mammals raises the risk of the virus adapting in a way that could make it spread more easily in humans. So far, one human case has been reported in a Texas farmworker, who has since recovered, and a further 44 people have been monitored after possible exposure.\n\nIt is not clear how the virus is spreading between cows, but milk is believed to be the primary vector rather than the virus spreading through respiratory infection.\n\n\"We believe that the primary transfer is through milk ... some kind of mechanical transmission,\" said Watson. This could be via milking equipment, people moving between facilities or rodents, he added. \"At this stage we'er just speculating,\" he said. \"[It could be] spilt milk on floors, if a rat was to come into contact with that milk and then move to a different facility or come into contact with a cow or a piece of equipment.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_devlin@theguardian.com", "name": "Hannah Devlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In situ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31e531876ac8a51297a249baff62228676498a37/0_166_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7122c8506491ed1913c0018b0f1a5e68", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Farms with cows that are sick will need to undergo investigations before moving cattle across state lines.\n\n\"The primary focus of the order, initially, will be lactating cattle. But we will certainly have the opportunity to expand beyond that as necessary,\" Mike Watson, head of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nOfficials previously said that the unprecedented spread of the virus among dairy cattle likely traces to a single spillover event from wild birds, based on an analysis of genetic sequences collected from sick cattle.\n\nSince then, genetic data and investigations suggest the virus has spread to infect cows across at least eight states and a human dairy worker in Texas. Egg farms from Texas and Michigan are also suspected to have been infected by virus that spread from cows, adding to millions of poultry culled because of infections from wild birds.\n\n\"Those farms have been in close proximity to affected dairy farms. And so there could be lateral flow from the dairy farms to these poultry operations, to these egg laying operations. This could be such things as transfer of the virus through fomites, such as on clothing or on vehicles,\" National Milk Producers Federation chief science officer Jamie Jonker said at recent Swine Health Information Center webinar.\n\nThe virus was not initially found in the respiratory tract of most infected cows, officials said, suggesting it is not spreading through the air between cows like other kinds of influenza. Instead, H5N1 HPAI in the current outbreak has been found almost exclusively in raw milk and the cow organs that produce it. Officials think the virus may have spread between cows during the milking process on farms, through surfaces contaminated with infected raw milk.\n\nHowever, Watson said that at least one cow headed to slaughter has now been found with signs of the virus in its lung tissue. The cow was condemned by USDA inspectors and did not enter the food supply, Watson said.\n\nFederal scientists have also found a mutation in another sick cow from Kansas that had a genetic change that adapted the flu to spread better in mammals.\n\n\"The one sequence shift and the one dairy cow with H5N1 in the lung tissue so far appear to be isolated events. However, the novel movement of H5N1 between wild birds and dairy cows requires further testing,\" Watson said.\n\nCows mostly have been recovering from the virus without dying, Watson said. That's in stark contrast to the kind of mass die-offs seen in birds and some other species. However, dairy industry officials have previously said some cows have yet to recover their ability to produce milk, raising concerns of long-term issues for some cattle.\n\n\"We need time to develop an understanding to support any future courses of action. So this federal order is critical to increasing the information available for USDA,\" said Watson.\n\nWhile health authorities say they think previous work pasteurizing eggs for HPAI H5N1 and milk for other germs suggests the process will be enough to eradicate the danger from any lingering traces of the virus found in milk, they say studies are also ongoing now to verify that pasteurized milk remains safe.\n\n\"A positive PCR test does not necessarily mean that the sample contains an intact infectious pathogen and that additional testing is required to determine whether intact pathogen is still present and if it remains infectious,\" Don Prater, head of the FDA's food safety center, said at the news briefing.\n\nThis involves what FDA says is the \"gold standard\" for checking if the virus that they found is potentially infectious, taking the H5N1 HPAI particles they found and seeing if it will grow in chicken eggs.\n\nResearch backed by the National Institutes of Health has also found H5N1 HPAI fragments in milk. Early testing of those samples suggests the virus in the pasteurized milk was not infectious, trying to grow the virus in cells and chicken eggs.\n\n\"While this is welcome news, the effort studied a small number of samples that is not necessarily representative of all retail milk. So to really understand the scope here, we need to wait for the FDA,\" said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo.\n\nPrater said that the samples had come from a national survey of the U.S. milk supply, but declined to share details of where they had been found and what kinds of milk have tested positive.\n\n\"We don't have information yet to share but it will be coming out very shortly and that's what I can share at this point,\" said Prater.\n\nMilk from cows known to be sick with symptoms of the virus is not entering the supply chain, Prater said. But it is possible that the virus could be making it into the supply chain from other sources, Prater said, possibly from cows that are not yet symptomatic or have previously recovered.\n\nFDA has some data that could help investigators trace where the milk with the virus made it into the food supply, Prater said.\n\n\"Right now we will be able to look at information that we are collecting as part of this. Our traceability information is good, but it's not perfect,\" said Prater.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Watson,_Baron_Watson_of_Invergowrie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/03/20/d9ac6e6b-891f-4461-9fea-7e3a0c487d13/thumbnail/1200x630/8a22eb15153337830ed22789447e6b91/milk.jpg?v=1da0267dcfd5e1d387d4678a648e733c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday, the FDA said that, in order to identify where the contaminated milk was found, it was conducting a nationwide survey of commercially sold milk and would release its results in the coming days.\n\nWhen the outbreak was first detected at the end of March, in an effort to keep the milk supply safe, farmers were instructed to discard the milk of sick cows, Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said during a joint media briefing Wednesday.\n\nFarmers were also told by the USDA to test symptomatic cows.\n\nThe discovery of the virus in the commercial milk supply, however, indicates those approaches weren't enough.\n\nIt's unclear how the new mandate might curb the spread of the virus -- a strain of the bird flu called H5N1 -- among the nation's cattle. The virus has already been detected in dairy cows in eight states: Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas.\n\nA big question for scientists now is, how long has it been going on and where else has it spread?\n\n\"I think it's safe to say that it's longer and much more extensive that has been realized,\" said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and former professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe outbreak concerns scientists and public health officials because H5N1 can be especially deadly in people. However, once in people, the virus doesn't spread easily.\n\nDr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during the media briefing that there's no indication that the H5N1 flu strain is causing any uptick in illness among people or poses an immediate danger to the public.\n\n\"CDC has not identified any out-of-the-ordinary influenza-related emergency department visits, even when we compare areas where H5N1 has spread among cattle against areas where it has not,\" Shah said.\n\nOne person, a dairy worker in Texas, was infected earlier this month. The CDC said that the case was mild and the worker developed conjunctivitis, or pink eye.\n\nShah noted that another 44 people are being \"actively monitored,\" for illness.\n\nIn addition to testing dairy cows before transporting them, Wednesday's order also requires that state veterinary labs report any positive tests to federal health authorities.\n\n\"If [the cows] end up testing positive, they will have a 30-day waiting period before they could move and have to be tested again,\" Mike Watson, administrator for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said during the media briefing.\n\nThe worry is not whether people can catch the flu by drinking milk. The U.S. milk supply undergoes a mandatory pasteurization process, heating milk to a point where any bacteria or virus should be killed.\n\nThough the FDA has not completed studies specifically looking at whether pasteurization kills the virus that causes bird flu, the agency said on Tuesday that, \"to date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\nThe FDA plans to release results of studies looking at pasteurization's effects on the bird flu virus in the coming days or weeks.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_T.H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard T.H.

In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds.

Blair/Statesman-Journal via AP, File)\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants - goats and then dairy cows - in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.\n\n\"When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u00b4s Research Hospital.\n\nFlu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.\n\nFinding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \"suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\" said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.\n\nThe data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.\n\nSince then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nAnd then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\" Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\"\n\nSeveral experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.\n\n\"We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.\n\n\"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nMore testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\"\n\nScientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nAlso, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.\n\nSo far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nDavid O\u00b4Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.\n\n\"There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we\u00b4re not there,\" he said.

Here's what experts say", "body": "By Drew Kann, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution The Tribune Content Agency\n\nATLANTA -- Since 2022, a highly contagious strain of bird flu has spread across the U.S. at an unprecedented rate, resulting in the deaths of more than 90 million birds in commercial and backyard poultryflocks, plus thousands more in the wild.\n\nThen, in late March, the virus made a jump to another species that surprised many scientists: cows.\n\nDairy cattle in eight states have since tested positive for the virus, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's tracker showed on Tuesday. So far, there have been no reported cases in Georgia.\n\nBut there have been other developments that are worrying influenza experts.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration said it had found inactive fragments of the virus in commercially available pasteurized milk, but said consumers who drink it are not at risk of infection.\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the FDA said in a statement.\n\nAn employee at one of the Texas dairy farms with positive cases in its cows also contracted the virus, the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed April 1. The worker's case isonly the second-ever human case reported in the U.S.The man, who worked inclose contact with cows and likely caught the virus from cattle, developed only a mild eye infection and has recovered.\n\nThe CDC says the threat to the general population remains low and the USDA says there are no signs the virus has changed in ways that could allow it to spread more efficiently to and among people. Still, experts say any transmission from mammals to humans is an unwelcome opportunity for the virus to adapt in ways that could heighten the risk to humans.\n\nThe coming weeks could be key to determining whether the virus' emergence in cows is the start of a growing public health threat or not.\n\nAs the situation evolves, here's what you need to know:\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) - also known asbird flu - refers to the disease caused by a group of viruses that have spread among wild birds around the world for decades.\n\nIn birds, the virus spreads in fecal droppings and through respiratory secretions, causing lethargy, tremors, seizures and death. The virus' high transmissibility, combined with the fact that most commercial poultry are kept in close quarters, means cases in poultry facilities typically require culling of entire flocks of tens of thousands of birdsto stop the spread.\n\nA growing list of land and marinemammals have also contracted bird flu, including seals, sea lions, mink, otters, foxes, cats and now, cows. Tens of thousands of mammals across at least 26 countries have died.\n\nThere have also been sporadic infections in humans, too, but typically only in people who have had close, unprotected contact with infected animals, primarily poultry. Since 1997, there have been 890 reported human infections globally with the bird flu subtypeprevalent among wild birds currently, known as H5N1. Of those, roughly 50% of cases were fatal, but reported symptoms have varied widely, from none at all to severe disease. Overall, the CDC says the spectrum of illness caused by the strains circulating right now is unknown.\n\nHow did cows catch it?\n\nBird flu was likely originally transmitted to cows by wild migratingbirds, according to a USDA memo published April 16. The agency adds there is now evidence of cow-to-cow spread in some recent cases.\n\nThe virus may have also spread from dairy cattle to nearby poultry and barn cats on some farms, too, but the exact pathways are not yet known. In the latest cases, the sickened cows have survived but other animals, including cats and poultry, have died.\n\nCompared to birds, cows are experiencing mild symptoms: low energy, fever, dehydration and reduced appetite, plus thick, discolored milk and a decrease in production, the USDA says.\n\nThe raw milk of infected cows has been found to contain high concentrations of H5N1 and USDA has warned dairy workers to avoid any exposure to unpasteurized milk. To tamp down the spread, the agency has recommended \"particular attention\" to disinfecting milking equipment, as well as pens and other surfaces.\n\nIn the meantime, the USDA and the FDA both say that pasteurization has proven to kill viruses and bacteria, and there is no risk of infection from drinking commercial milk. And so far, the limited number of cases, plus cows' relatively quick recovery from infection means there's no threat to the country's milk supply, for now.\n\nRaw milk from sick cattle, however, has tested positive for the virus, and the CDC has urged people not to consume raw, unpasteurized milk. Dairy advocacy groups, like the Dairy Alliance, which represents farmers in Georgia and other Southeastern states, are echoing that sentiment.\n\n\"With raw milk, it's always a risk, regardless of this virus,\" said Geri Berdak, CEO of the Dairy Alliance, which counts roughly 75 farms in Georgia among its members. \"There are absolutely no safety concerns with pasteurized milk.\"\n\nWhy are cow cases worrisome?\n\nMost humans aren't regularly in close proximity to wild birds or many of the other mammals that have contracted bird flu during the current outbreak.\n\nBut cows are a domesticated species regularly in close contact with people on farms. That is troubling to Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University.\n\n\"I'm always concerned when bird viruses are getting into mammals ... but the cows are concerning because like pigs, they have a really extensive contact network,\" said Lakdawala.\n\nPigs, which are vulnerable to both avian and flu viruses, have long been identified as a potential \"mixing vessel,\" where bird and human influenza viruses could recombine to create a new strain that spreads more effectively from person-to-person. So far, there's no evidence this is occurring.\n\nWhile bird flu has appeared in many mammal species during the current outbreak, cows were not considered likely candidates to catch the disease, experts say. Virologists have long known cattle were vulnerable to influenza type D viruses, but not influenza A viruses like the current bird flu strain, Lakdawala said. Influenza A is one of two main subtypes that typically cause illness in humans.\n\nDavid Skallnecht, a professor emeritus at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine, said he didn't expect cattle to catch the virus, but was not terribly shocked that they had.\n\n\"I don't think anyone really saw this coming, but there's one thing that needs to be clear: As far as susceptibility goes, you can probably infect anything on the planet with flu, if you give it the right dose and the right virus,\" Skallnecht said.\n\nThe concern now, Lakdawala said, is whether the virus, as it circulates among cattle, could change in ways that make it more transmissible to humans, or from person to person.\n\n\"It's not known how the virus will evolve in cattle and whether it will gain some of the mutations that we think of in terms of sensitivity to influenza in humans,\" Lakdawala said.\n\nWhat's being done to stop the spread?\n\nGeorgia is not one of the country's top-10 milk-producing states, but with an estimated 92,000 dairy cattle, it is still home to a robust milk industry.\n\nGeorgia's response to the cases in dairy cows is being led by the Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) and its Commissioner, Tyler Harper. In a statement, Harper said his \"team is in constant communication with our federal partners as well as dairy producers, veterinarians, and public health officials ... \"\n\nSo far, the GDA is hewing closely to the USDA's latest guidance issued April 12.\n\nThe USDA has urged dairy producers to monitor animals for signs of illness, to minimize the movement of cattle and to conduct testing of animals before they are transported, along with a host of other recommendations.\n\nBut while some states have restricted the import of cattle from regions with cases of the virus, Georgia has not. In a statement, GDA spokesman Matthew Agvent said Georgia has imported cattle from states with positive cases, but no cows from affected herds have been brought to Georgia.\n\nIf a cow in Georgia does test positive, Agvent said movement of that herd \"would be restricted and it would be monitored until clinical signs are resolved.\" Agvent added that GDA is working closely with the Georgia Department of Public Health to develop an operational plan in the event that a human case does occur.\n\nTo prevent human cases, Agvent said the agency recommends dairy workers follow CDC guidance and wear personal protective equipment around cattle, and avoid contact with their eyes, nose, and mouth, among other measures.\n\nWhat else?\n\nIn the CDC's most recent update published Friday, the agency said it is possible there could be more human infections. But absent genetic changes that would make the virus more transmissible to people or evidence of sustained person-to-person spread, the agency reiterated its view that the virus poses a low risk to the general public\n\nAs of last week, the USDA said that it had not found any evidence the virus has mutated in ways that would allow it to spread more easily to and among people.\n\nIn the meantime, the CDC has begun testing FDA-approved antiviral drugs used against seasonal flu on the strain of virus that infected a worker in Texas. The agency said it found the virus was \"susceptible\" to all of those commercially-available drugs.\n\nThe CDC is also exploring whether existing candidate vaccine viruses could protect against this strain of bird flu, in case the mass production of vaccines is needed. The agency's early analysis suggests two of those candidates would likely offer protection.\n\nAmid the worry about the cow cases, other experts, like UGA's Skallnecht, say we cannot lose sight of the toll the virus has taken on wild animals. The disease has ravaged populations around the world, including in species that had bounced back after decades-long conservation efforts, like the bald eagle and the California condor.\n\nThough recent developments are concerning, Skallnecht said there are early signs that immunity is developing in certain bird species. If true, that could help pump the brakes on the virus' unfettered spread in the wild.\n\n\"It's probably not going to go away, but it may be less of a problem,\" Skallnecht said. \"That's what we're hoping for.\"", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "atlanta_journal_constitution@bradenton.com", "name": "Atlanta

The new policy is part of a growing effort to stamp out the spread of a virus that federal health officials have sought to reassure Americans poses little risk to people so far.\n\nThe new order, issued by the Department of Agriculture, says that lactating cows must test negative for influenza A viruses, a class that includes bird flu, before they are transported. The owners of herds with positive tests will need to provide data on the movements of the cattle to help investigators trace the disease.\n\nThe testing will help protect the livestock industry, limit the spread of the virus and \"better understand this disease,\" Mike Watson, a senior Department of Agriculture official, told reporters in a press briefing Wednesday morning.\n\nSince a highly contagious form of bird flu was detected in the United States in 2022, federal officials have sought to reassure Americans that the threat to the public remained low, even as the virus infected a growing number of mammals. Federal regulators on Tuesday announced that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, a suggestion that the virus was likely spreading much more widely among cattle than previously known.\n\nDr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Wednesday that there were no changes in the genetic makeup of the virus that would allow it to spread easily among people. So far, Shah said, states have been monitoring 44 people who were exposed to the virus and are being monitored for infection.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the outbreak had spread to 33 herds in eight states, according to the USDA. But just one human infection has been reported, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild.\n\nFederal officials on Wednesday also sought to downplay the severity of the findings of the Food and Drug Administration in recent days that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, including some from grocery shelves. Don Prater, an FDA official, told reporters on Wednesday that regulators were conducting more advanced tests to determine whether any milk contained live virus. The agency would publish data in the coming days on the milk tests, he said.\n\nThe USDA order will require laboratories and state veterinarians to report any positive tests from cattle to the agency. Watson said that the department would be able to process tens of thousands of tests each day, with results reported after one to three days. The agency will now reimburse dairies for testing cows without symptoms as well as those being moved.\n\nShah, the CDC official, said that the federal government was relying on local officials and health workers to communicate with dairy producers and their workers, including veterinarians who have close relationships with people who might be hesitant to open up to strangers.\n\n\"There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health, to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themselves as being from the government in some way,\" Shah said.\n\nIt is still not clear when the bird flu outbreak began, but an analysis of genetic data suggests that wild birds might have passed the pathogen to cows as early as December. Cows were not typically thought to be susceptible to bird flu, and it was not until late March that federal officials announced that the virus had been detected in sick cows in Texas and Kansas.\n\nThe USDA order came after public health experts and dairy producers had criticized the Biden administration for the scope of its investigation into the cow outbreak and the lack of widespread testing.\n\nWhile testing more cows is critical, so is reducing the risk of infection among dairy workers regularly exposed to fresh milk now thought to contain extensive virus, said Seema Lakdawala, a virus expert at Emory University.\n\nIf a worker were to get splashed in the nose or eyes and become infected, that human infection would give the virus new opportunities to adapt and start spreading among people, she said.\n\nFederal health officials said Wednesday that they had reminded states that they could request protective equipment from the national stockpile.\n\nBut Lakdawala said the risks of worker infections were already serious enough that farms should universally implement the use of face shields. She said other steps, like a two-week 'stay-at-home' order for cows, could also obviate the need for even more economically disruptive measures.\n\nTroy Sutton, a virus expert at Penn State University, said the emergence of the bird flu in cattle had intensified efforts to understand the virus.\n\n\"It's now moved into a species that humans have more contact with,\" he said.", "source":

Here's what that means", "body": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand -- and stop -- the growing outbreak.\n\nU.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand -- and stop -- the growing outbreak.\n\nSo far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people.\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested -- with negative results -- before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nThis strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska.\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants -- goats and then dairy cows -- in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.\n\n\"When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nFlu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.\n\nFinding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \"suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\" said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.\n\nThe data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.\n\nSince then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nAnd then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\" Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\"\n\nSeveral experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.\n\n\"We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.\n\n\"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nMore testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\"\n\nScientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nAlso, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.\n\nSo far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nDavid O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.\n\n\"There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we're not there,\" he said.

If those tests come back positive, herd owners will need to provide data on the movements of those cattle so investigators can trace the disease.\n\nThat should help stem the spread of the virus and help officials \"better understand this disease,\" Mike Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said during a media briefing, the New York Times reported.\n\nEver since a highly contagious form of bird flu was detected in the United States back in 2022, federal officials have reassured Americans that the threat to the public remained low. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, which suggests the virus has been spreading much more widely among cattle than thought. The results of tests to determine whether any live virus is in the milk supply are expected in the coming days, FDA officials added.\n\nSo far, no changes have been seen in the virus that would help it spread easily among people, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday, the Times reported. States have been monitoring 44 people who were exposed to the virus, Shah added.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the outbreak had spread to 33 herds in nine states, according to the USDA. But just one human infection has been reported, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild.\n\nShah said the federal government was relying on local officials and health workers to communicate with dairy producers and their workers, including veterinarians who have close relationships with people who might be hesitant to open up to strangers.\n\n\"There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health, to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themselves as being from the government in some way,\" Shah explained.\n\nWhile it isn't clear when the bird flu outbreak among cows began, an analysis of genetic data suggests wild birds may have passed the virus to cows as early as last December. Cows were not believed to be vulnerable to bird flu, and it was late March before federal officials first announced the virus had been detected in sick cows in Texas and Kansas.\n\nWhile testing more cows is critical, reducing the risk of infection among dairy workers exposed to raw cow milk is paramount, said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nIf a worker were splashed with raw, infected milk in the nose or eyes and become sick, that would give the virus new chances to start spreading among people, she explained.\n\nAlthough federal health officials said Wednesday they had reminded states that they could request protective worker equipment from the national stockpile, Lakdawala said the risks of worker infections were already serious enough that farms should mandate the use of face shields.\n\nShe said other steps, like two-week 'stay-at-home' orders for infected cows, could also lower the need for more drastic measures.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on bird flu.\n\nSOURCES: U.S. Department of Agriculture, news release, April 24, 2024; New York Times\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAs bird flu

The Agriculture Department says 33 herds have been affected to date.\n\nFDA officials didn't indicate how many samples they tested or where they were obtained. The agency has been evaluating milk during processing and from grocery stores, officials said. Results of additional tests are expected in \"the next few days to weeks.\"\n\nThe PCR lab test the FDA used would have detected viral genetic material even after live virus was killed by pasteurisation or heat treatment, said Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University\n\n\"There is no evidence to date that this is an infectious virus, and the FDA is following up on that,\" Jaykus said.\n\nOfficials with the FDA and the USDA had previously said milk from affected cattle did not enter the commercial supply. Milk from sick animals is supposed to be diverted and destroyed. Federal regulations require milk that enters interstate commerce to be pasteurised.\n\nBecause the detection of the bird flu virus known as Type A H5N1 in dairy cattle is new and the situation is evolving, no studies on the effects of pasteurization on the virus have been completed, FDA officials said. But past research shows that pasteurization is \"very likely\" to inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1, the agency added.\n\nMatt Herrick, a spokesman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said that time and temperature regulations for pasteurization ensure that the commercial US milk supply is safe. Remnants of the virus \"have zero impact on human health,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nScientists confirmed the H5N1 virus in dairy cows in March after weeks of reports that cows in Texas were suffering from a mysterious malady. The cows were lethargic and saw a dramatic reduction in milk production. Although the H5N1 virus is lethal to commercial poultry, most infected cattle seem to recover within two weeks, experts said.\n\nTo date, two people in US have been infected with bird flu. A Texas dairy worker who was in close contact with an infected cow recently developed a mild eye infection and has recovered. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program caught it while killing infected birds at a Colorado poultry farm. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.", "source": {"uri": "1news.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "1 News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@1news.co.nz", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microbiologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethargy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lethargy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Dairy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Dairy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://tvnz-1-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/milk-stock-5QMDTPBASRAWPAA4W2IFWEIUVA.jpg?auth=692040343ac3368209730d09242c394a68e6f9242be18a19697481efd039c29c&quality=70&width=600&height=315&focal=2592%2C1728", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

This is part of an ongoing effort to track and gain control of the ever-growing outbreak.\n\nThis announcement was proceeded by a revelation from health officials earlier in the week stating they had detected remnants of Type A H5N1 virus in samples taken from milk both during its processing stage and on store shelves. However, it was emphasised that these remnants pose no known risk to humans or indeed the integrity of the milk supply.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Anus-eating' virus that kills 30% of people is spreading - 'something has happened'\n\nThere's lots of quality news coming out of the US.\n\n\"The risk to humans remains low,\" confirmed Dawn O'Connell from the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, reports the Mirror US.\n\nAs of Monday, the novel order will require every lactating cow to undergo testing for the virus and receive a negative result before being permitted to travel to another state. According to Michael Watson from the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, implementing this rule will aid in understanding how the virus disseminates.\n\n\"We believe we can do tens of thousands of tests a day,\" Watson conveyed to journalists. Up until recently, testing was only conducted voluntarily and exclusively in cows exhibiting symptoms.\n\nThe presence of avian influenza was initially spotted within dairy cows in March but since then it has been identified in almost three dozen herds across eight different states, as per information provided by the USDA.\n\nThe ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, spread by wild birds, has escalated. Since the outbreak began more than 90 million birds in US commercial flocks have either succumbed to the virus or been culled to prevent further spread.\n\nTwo individuals in the US, both farmworkers, have contracted bird flu since the outbreak started. Health officials revealed 23 people have been tested for bird flu so far and 44 individuals exposed to infected animals are under observation.\n\nOfficials disclosed that samples from a cow in Kansas indicated the virus could be adapting to more animals. They detected the H5N1 virus in the lung tissue of a dairy cow that had been culled and sent for slaughter.\n\nThus far, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not observed any signs that the virus is mutating to become more transmissible to humans.\n\nThe USDA, FDA and CDC provided two reasons why the commercial milk supply remains safe for human consumption: the pasteurisation process and the diversion or destruction of milk from ill cows.\n\n\"Pasteurisation is a process that kills harmful bacteria and viruses by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time to make milk safer,\" an FDA advisory said. \"Even if a virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurisation is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health.\"\n\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType":

Avian influenzaor before HPAI H5N1 travels between states, federal officials announced Wednesday.\n\nUSDA's move to tighten testing requirements for HPAI H5N1 comes after the Food and Drug Administration disclosed On Tuesday, it was announced that a sample of pasteurized milk sold on grocery store shelves had tested positive for the virus, making it clear whether the positive test was caused by lingering dead \"viral particles\" or live infection. This prompted further research to determine whether it was caused by a sexually transmitted virus.\n\nThe announcement also comes after federal authorities said they had discovered an \"isolated\" but alarming change in the virus in cattle, which U.S. officials believe was contracted from wild birds. .\n\nState veterinarians and laboratories that test positive for the virus in cattle will be required to report the results to the Department of Agriculture. Farms with sick cattle must be inspected before moving cattle across state lines.\n\n\"The main focus is order, initially it will be a lactating cow. But there is certainly an opportunity to expand beyond that if needed,\" Mike Watson, director of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nofficial said before Based on analysis of genetic sequences collected from sick cows, researchers found that the unprecedented spread of the virus among dairy cows was likely traced back to a single spillover event from wild birds.\n\nSince then, genetic data and research suggests the virus is spreading to infect cattle around the world. at least 8 states and human dairy worker In Texas. Making matters worse, egg farms in Texas and Michigan are also suspected of having contracted the virus, which spreads from cows. millions of poultry They are culled due to infection from wild birds.\n\n\"These farms were in close proximity to the affected dairy farms, so there could be lateral flow from the dairy farms to these poultry operations and then to these egg-laying operations. It could be transmission of the virus through fomites such as \"on clothing or vehicles,'' said Jamie Jonker, chief scientific officer at the National Milk Producers Federation. This was stated in a Health Information Center webinar.\n\nOfficials said the virus was initially undetectable in the respiratory tract of most infected cows, suggesting it was not transmitted through the air between cows like other types of influenza. Instead, his H5N1 HPAI in the current epidemic has been found almost exclusively. in raw milk And the cow organs that produce it. Officials believe the virus may have spread between cows during the milking process on the farm, via surfaces contaminated with infected raw milk.\n\nHowever, Watson said signs of the virus were found in the lung tissue of at least one cow headed for slaughter. Watson said the cow was condemned by USDA inspectors and was not added to the food supply.\n\nFederal scientists also discovered a mutation in another sick cow in Kansas that carries a genetic change that makes influenza easier to spread to mammals.\n\n\"This one sequence change and one dairy cow with H5N1 in its lung tissue appear to be isolated events so far, but new transfers of H5N1 between wild birds and dairy cows are likely to lead to further Testing is required,\" Watson said.\n\nMost of the cows have recovered from the virus without dying, Watson said.That's in stark contrast to something like mass death seen in birds etc. other species. However, dairy industry officials have previously said that some cows have not yet regained their ability to produce milk, raising concerns that some may have long-term problems.\n\n\"We need time to develop a better understanding to support future courses of action, so this federal order is critical to increasing the information available to USDA,\" Watson said.\n\nHealth officials say previous studies that have pasteurized eggs for the HPAI H5N1 virus and milk for other bacteria have shown that this process is sufficient to eradicate the danger from residual traces of the virus in milk. He said he thinks this suggests that the product is pasteurized, but says research is currently underway to verify that it has been pasteurized. Milk remains safe.\n\n\"A positive PCR test does not necessarily mean that the sample contains an intact infectious agent, but rather whether the intact pathogen is still present or infectious \"Additional testing is needed to determine whether any remains.\" At a press conference.\n\nThis includes what the FDA has said is the \"gold standard\" for determining whether the virus it has discovered can be transmitted, by collecting the H5N1 HPAI particles it has discovered and making sure they are Check to see if it grows in chicken eggs.\n\nResearch supported by the National Institutes of Health also detected H5N1 HPAI fragments in milk. Initial testing of these samples suggested that the virus in the pasteurized milk was not infectious and was trying to reproduce in cells and chicken eggs.\n\n\"While this is welcome news, this effort studied a small number of samples that are not necessarily representative of all retail milk. So to really understand the scope here, we will wait for the FDA. \"There is a need for this,\" the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. Directed by Dr. Jeanne Marazzo.\n\nPrater said the samples were obtained from a national survey of the U.S. milk supply, but did not provide details about where the samples were found or what type of milk tested positive.\n\n\"We don't have any information to share yet, but it will be announced soon and that's all we can share at this time,\" Prater said.\n\nPrater said milk from cows known to have symptoms of the virus has not entered the supply chain. However, Professor Prater said the virus could enter the supply chain from other sources, perhaps from cattle that have not yet shown symptoms or have previously recovered.\n\nPrater said the FDA has some data that could help law enforcement trace where the virus-laden milk entered the food supply.\n\n\"At this point, we will be able to review the information we are collecting as part of this. Our traceability information is good, but not perfect,\" Prater said.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Watson,_Baron_Watson_of_Invergowrie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/03/20/d9ac6e6b-891f-4461-9fea-7e3a0c487d13/thumbnail/1200x630/8a22eb15153337830ed22789447e6b91/milk.jpg?v=1da0267dcfd5e1d387d4678a648e733c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Here's what that means", "body": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand - and stop - the growing outbreak.\n\nSo far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people.\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested - with negative results - before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nThis strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska.\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants - goats and then dairy cows - in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.\n\nCanadian officials monitoring avian flu on dairy farms after first-ever case detected in U.S. cows\n\n\"When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nFlu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.\n\nFinding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \"suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\" said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.\n\nThe data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.\n\nSince then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nAnd then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\" Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\"\n\nSeveral experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.\n\n\"We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.\n\n\"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nMore testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\"\n\nScientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nAlso, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.\n\nSo far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nDavid O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.\n\n\"There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we're not there,\" he said. As with a tornado watch, \"you wouldn't change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.\"\n\nWorobey said this is the kind of outbreak \"that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.\"\n\nHe said ambitious screening is needed \"to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor_seal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harbor seal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porpoise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polar bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Arizona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/3JISRRYXPNABJACKSRU6WBHDDY.jpg?auth=49fb962f571797907b03b2e64d6f0f1e86320ece96cdf17ac5995152199a75f6&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The DNA testing done so far was unable to determine conclusively whether the viral particles were active or inactive.\n\nPrater described the situation as novel and evolving but asserted that pasteurization and sterilization have \"served public health well for over 100 years.\"\n\nAnd studies done on similar virus types indicate that while pasteurization may not eliminate the virus, it will inactivate it, said Suresh Kuchipudi, professor and chair of the department of infectious disease and microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Public Health.\n\nDawn O'Connell, Health and Human Services assistant secretary for preparedness and response, stressed that the risk to human health is low but that the federal government remains \"watchful and ever ready ... to keep the American people safe.\"\n\nSteve Lyle, a spokesman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, who was not on the call, said in an email that the federal government was the lead on this, and the state had no additional response or information to share.\n\nGovernment researchers are actively testing the virus found in milk samples in the laboratory to see whether it grows in either cell cultures or embryonated chicken eggs. These tests, said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will indicate whether the virus is active, or not.\n\nEarly tests indicate the virus is not alive.\n\nThey are also expanding their surveillance and monitoring and suggested that more information will be released in the days to come.\n\nIn addition, they issued a federal order requiring that laboratories report any dairy cattle testing positive for avian flu or any type of influenza A, as well as the testing of all lactating dairy cattle moving between states. In addition, any farm where bird flu positive cows have been discovered will be required to undergo epidemiological investigation and movement tracing, said Mike Watson, administrator for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nDetails on the number of milk samples tested, where they were obtained, and how many of the samples tested positive for the virus were not shared with reporters\n\nNirav Shah, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency has tested 23 people for the virus and are actively monitoring 44 people \"who are considered exposed and at risk for infection.\"\n\nSo far, only one human case has been identified in the current outbreak, and that person was reported to have exhibited only mild symptoms.\n\nIn other places where humans have been infected, the virus has made people sicker and has even been lethal. According to the World Health Organization, which has been tracking the virus, between January 2003 and February 2024, there were 887 confirmed cases of human infection across 23 countries. Of those, 462 were fatal.\n\nWhile the current virus has not developed the ability to become more transmissible to humans, researchers have noted some worrisome mutations.\n\nThese include the observations of the virus spreading between cows within the same herd, from cows to poultry, and the movement of the virus between dairies associated with cattle movements. It's also been detected in cows that didn't have clinical signs of the disease -- suggesting it is moving unnoticed.\n\nIn addition, on April 16, a USDA microbiologist \"identified a shift\" in one sample from McAllen, Kan., that appeared to show a mutation that would make it more transmissible between mammals, said Watson, the USDA official. He said further analyses by the CDC showed \"low risk overall.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microbiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cell culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sterilization (microbiology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Watson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b4ed15/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2025+0+179/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F16%2Fe6%2F75a6722147b7b2dea3e2923d6769%2F921431-na-us-calif-biofuels-bakersfield-17-brv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 4307, "textEnd": 4315}, {"amb": false, "date": "2003-01-", "textStart": 3708, "textEnd": 3720}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Here's what experts say", "body": "Since 2022, a highly contagious strain of bird flu has spread across the U.S. at an unprecedented rate, resulting in the deaths of more than 90 million birds in commercial and backyard poultry flocks, plus thousands more in the wild.\n\nThen, in late March, the virus made a jump to another species that surprised many scientists: cows.\n\nDairy cattle in eight states have since tested positive for the virus, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's tracker showed on Tuesday. So far, there have been no reported cases in Georgia.\n\nBut there have been other developments that are worrying influenza experts.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration said it had found inactive fragments of the virus in commercially available pasteurized milk, but said consumers who drink it are not at risk of infection.\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the FDA said in a statement.\n\nAn employee at one of the Texas dairy farms with positive cases in its cows also contracted the virus, the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed April 1. The worker's case is only the second-ever human case reported in the U.S. The man, who worked in close contact with cows and likely caught the virus from cattle, developed only a mild eye infection and has recovered.\n\nThe CDC says the threat to the general population remains low and the USDA says there are no signs the virus has changed in ways that could allow it to spread more efficiently to and among people. Still, experts say any transmission from mammals to humans is an unwelcome opportunity for the virus to adapt in ways that could heighten the risk to humans.\n\nThe coming weeks could be key to determining whether the virus' emergence in cows is the start of a growing public health threat or not.\n\nAs the situation evolves, here's what you need to know:\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) -- also known as bird flu -- refers to the disease caused by a group of viruses that have spread among wild birds around the world for decades.\n\nIn birds, the virus spreads in fecal droppings and through respiratory secretions, causing lethargy, tremors, seizures and death. The virus' high transmissibility, combined with the fact that most commercial poultry are kept in close quarters, means cases in poultry facilities typically require culling of entire flocks of tens of thousands of birds to stop the spread.\n\nA growing list of land and marine mammals have also contracted bird flu, including seals, sea lions, mink, otters, foxes, cats and now, cows. Tens of thousands of mammals across at least 26 countries have died.\n\nThere have also been sporadic infections in humans, too, but typically only in people who have had close, unprotected contact with infected animals, primarily poultry. Since 1997, there have been 890 reported human infections globally with the bird flu subtype prevalent among wild birds currently, known as H5N1. Of those, roughly 50% of cases were fatal, but reported symptoms have varied widely, from none at all to severe disease. Overall, the CDC says the spectrum of illness caused by the strains circulating right now is unknown.\n\nBird flu was likely originally transmitted to cows by wild migrating birds, according to a USDA memo published April 16. The agency adds there is now evidence of cow-to-cow spread in some recent cases.\n\nThe virus may have also spread from dairy cattle to nearby poultry and barn cats on some farms, too, but the exact pathways are not yet known. In the latest cases, the sickened cows have survived but other animals, including cats and poultry, have died.\n\nCompared to birds, cows are experiencing mild symptoms: low energy, fever, dehydration and reduced appetite, plus thick, discolored milk and a decrease in production, the USDA says.\n\nThe raw milk of infected cows has been found to contain high concentrations of H5N1 and USDA has warned dairy workers to avoid any exposure to unpasteurized milk. To tamp down the spread, the agency has recommended \"particular attention\" to disinfecting milking equipment, as well as pens and other surfaces.\n\nIn the meantime, the USDA and the FDA both say that pasteurization has proven to kill viruses and bacteria, and there is no risk of infection from drinking commercial milk. And so far, the limited number of cases, plus cows' relatively quick recovery from infection means there's no threat to the country's milk supply, for now.\n\nRaw milk from sick cattle, however, has tested positive for the virus, and the CDC has urged people not to consume raw, unpasteurized milk. Dairy advocacy groups, like the Dairy Alliance, which represents farmers in Georgia and other Southeastern states, are echoing that sentiment.\n\n\"With raw milk, it's always a risk, regardless of this virus,\" said Geri Berdak, CEO of the Dairy Alliance, which counts roughly 75 farms in Georgia among its members. \"There are absolutely no safety concerns with pasteurized milk.\"\n\nMost humans aren't regularly in close proximity to wild birds or many of the other mammals that have contracted bird flu during the current outbreak.\n\nBut cows are a domesticated species regularly in close contact with people on farms. That is troubling to Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory University.\n\n\"I'm always concerned when bird viruses are getting into mammals ... but the cows are concerning because like pigs, they have a really extensive contact network,\" said Lakdawala.\n\nPigs, which are vulnerable to both avian and flu viruses, have long been identified as a potential \"mixing vessel,\" where bird and human influenza viruses could recombine to create a new strain that spreads more effectively from person-to-person. So far, there's no evidence this is occurring.\n\nWhile bird flu has appeared in many mammal species during the current outbreak, cows were not considered likely candidates to catch the disease, experts say. Virologists have long known cattle were vulnerable to influenza type D viruses, but not influenza A viruses like the current bird flu strain, Lakdawala said. Influenza A is one of two main subtypes that typically cause illness in humans.\n\nDavid Skallnecht, a professor emeritus at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine, said he didn't expect cattle to catch the virus, but was not terribly shocked that they had.\n\n\"I don't think anyone really saw this coming, but there's one thing that needs to be clear: As far as susceptibility goes, you can probably infect anything on the planet with flu, if you give it the right dose and the right virus,\" Skallnecht said.\n\nThe concern now, Lakdawala said, is whether the virus, as it circulates among cattle, could change in ways that make it more transmissible to humans, or from person to person.\n\n\"It's not known how the virus will evolve in cattle and whether it will gain some of the mutations that we think of in terms of sensitivity to influenza in humans,\" Lakdawala said.\n\nGeorgia is not one of the country's top-10 milk-producing states, but with an estimated 92,000 dairy cattle, it is still home to a robust milk industry.\n\nGeorgia's response to the cases in dairy cows is being led by the Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) and its Commissioner, Tyler Harper. In a statement, Harper said his \"team is in constant communication with our federal partners as well as dairy producers, veterinarians, and public health officials ... \"\n\nSo far, the GDA is hewing closely to the USDA's latest guidance issued April 12.\n\nThe USDA has urged dairy producers to monitor animals for signs of illness, to minimize the movement of cattle and to conduct testing of animals before they are transported, along with a host of other recommendations.\n\nBut while some states have restricted the import of cattle from regions with cases of the virus, Georgia has not. In a statement, GDA spokesman Matthew Agvent said Georgia has imported cattle from states with positive cases, but no cows from affected herds have been brought to Georgia.\n\nIf a cow in Georgia does test positive, Agvent said movement of that herd \"would be restricted and it would be monitored until clinical signs are resolved.\" Agvent added that GDA is working closely with the Georgia Department of Public Health to develop an operational plan in the event that a human case does occur.\n\nTo prevent human cases, Agvent said the agency recommends dairy workers follow CDC guidance and wear personal protective equipment around cattle, and avoid contact with their eyes, nose, and mouth, among other measures.\n\nIn the CDC's most recent update published Friday, the agency said it is possible there could be more human infections. But absent genetic changes that would make the virus more transmissible to people or evidence of sustained person-to-person spread, the agency reiterated its view that the virus poses a low risk to the general public\n\nAs of last week, the USDA said that it had not found any evidence the virus has mutated in ways that would allow it to spread more easily to and among people.\n\nIn the meantime, the CDC has begun testing FDA-approved antiviral drugs used against seasonal flu on the strain of virus that infected a worker in Texas. The agency said it found the virus was \"susceptible\" to all of those commercially-available drugs.\n\nThe CDC is also exploring whether existing candidate vaccine viruses could protect against this strain of bird flu, in case the mass production of vaccines is needed. The agency's early analysis suggests two of those candidates would likely offer protection.\n\nAmid the worry about the cow cases, other experts, like UGA's Skallnecht, say we cannot lose sight of the toll the virus has taken on wild animals. The disease has ravaged populations around the world, including in species that had bounced back after decades-long conservation efforts, like the bald eagle and the California condor.\n\nThough recent developments are concerning, Skallnecht said there are early signs that immunity is developing in certain bird species. If true, that could help pump the brakes on the virus' unfettered spread in the wild.\n\n\"It's probably not going to go away, but it may be less of a problem,\" Skallnecht said. \"That's what we're hoping for.\"\n\n2024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "source": {"uri": "phys.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phys.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethargy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lethargy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emory University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Georgia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2022/bird-flu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 1115, "textEnd": 1122}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 3312, "textEnd": 3320}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-12", "textStart": 7565, "textEnd": 7573}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Here's what that means", "body": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand -- and stop -- the growing outbreak.\n\nSo far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people.\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested -- with negative results -- before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nThis strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska.\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants -- goats and then dairy cows -- in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.\n\n\"When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nFlu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.\n\nFinding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \"suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\" said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.\n\nThe data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.\n\nSince then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nAnd then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\" Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\"\n\nSeveral experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.\n\n\"We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.\n\n\"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nMore testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\"\n\nScientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nAlso, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.\n\nSo far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nDavid O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.\n\n\"There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we're not there,\" he said. As with a tornado watch, \"you wouldn't change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.\"\n\nWorobey said this is the kind of outbreak \"that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.\"\n\nHe said ambitious screening is needed \"to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.\"\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Farms with cows that are sick will need to undergo investigations before moving cattle across state lines.\n\n\"The primary focus of the order, initially, will be lactating cattle. But we will certainly have the opportunity to expand beyond that as necessary,\" Mike Watson, head of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters Wednesday.\n\n\"We should be very clear that the tests that came back positive are for the genetic material of the virus. This could just be virus fragments, what's left over after pasteurization. And so this by itself is not a reason for alarm,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"There are additional tests being done to see is this live infectious virus or is this just the dead virus we would expect to see.\"\n\nIf this is simply the leftovers after the pasteurization process, \"you should not get sick,\" Gounder added.\n\nOfficials previously said that the unprecedented spread of the virus among dairy cattle likely traces to a single spillover event from wild birds, based on an analysis of genetic sequences collected from sick cattle.\n\nSince then, genetic data and investigations suggest the virus has spread to infect cows across at least eight states and a human dairy worker in Texas. Egg farms from Texas and Michigan are also suspected to have been infected by virus that spread from cows, adding to millions of poultry culled because of infections from wild birds.\n\n\"Those farms have been in close proximity to affected dairy farms. And so there could be lateral flow from the dairy farms to these poultry operations, to these egg laying operations. This could be such things as transfer of the virus through fomites, such as on clothing or on vehicles,\" National Milk Producers Federation chief science officer Jamie Jonker said at recent Swine Health Information Center webinar.\n\nThe virus was not initially found in the respiratory tract of most infected cows, officials said, suggesting it is not spreading through the air between cows like other kinds of influenza. Instead, H5N1 HPAI in the current outbreak has been found almost exclusively in raw milk and the cow organs that produce it. Officials think the virus may have spread between cows during the milking process on farms, through surfaces contaminated with infected raw milk.\n\nHowever, Watson said that at least one cow headed to slaughter has now been found with signs of the virus in its lung tissue. The cow was condemned by USDA inspectors and did not enter the food supply, Watson said.\n\nFederal scientists have also found a mutation in another sick cow from Kansas that had a genetic change that adapted the flu to spread better in mammals.\n\n\"The one sequence shift and the one dairy cow with H5N1 in the lung tissue so far appear to be isolated events. However, the novel movement of H5N1 between wild birds and dairy cows requires further testing,\" Watson said.\n\nCows mostly have been recovering from the virus without dying, Watson said. That's in stark contrast to the kind of mass die-offs seen in birds and some other species. However, dairy industry officials have previously said some cows have yet to recover their ability to produce milk, raising concerns of long-term issues for some cattle.\n\n\"We need time to develop an understanding to support any future courses of action. So this federal order is critical to increasing the information available for USDA,\" said Watson.\n\nWhile health authorities say they think previous work pasteurizing eggs for HPAI H5N1 and milk for other germs suggests the process will be enough to eradicate the danger from any lingering traces of the virus found in milk, they say studies are also ongoing now to verify that pasteurized milk remains safe.\n\n\"A positive PCR test does not necessarily mean that the sample contains an intact infectious pathogen and that additional testing is required to determine whether intact pathogen is still present and if it remains infectious,\" Don Prater, head of the FDA's food safety center, said at the news briefing.\n\nThis involves what FDA says is the \"gold standard\" for checking if the virus that they found is potentially infectious, taking the H5N1 HPAI particles they found and seeing if it will grow in chicken eggs.\n\nResearch backed by the National Institutes of Health has also found H5N1 HPAI fragments in milk. Early testing of those samples suggests the virus in the pasteurized milk was not infectious, trying to grow the virus in cells and chicken eggs.\n\n\"While this is welcome news, the effort studied a small number of samples that is not necessarily representative of all retail milk. So to really understand the scope here, we need to wait for the FDA,\" said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo.\n\nPrater said that the samples had come from a national survey of the U.S. milk supply, but declined to share details of where they had been found and what kinds of milk have tested positive.\n\n\"We don't have information yet to share but it will be coming out very shortly and that's what I can share at this point,\" said Prater.\n\nMilk from cows known to be sick with symptoms of the virus is not entering the supply chain, Prater said. But it is possible that the virus could be making it into the supply chain from other sources, Prater said, possibly from cows that are not yet symptomatic or have previously recovered.\n\nFDA has some data that could help investigators trace where the milk with the virus made it into the food supply, Prater said.\n\n\"Right now we will be able to look at information that we are collecting as part of this. Our traceability information is good, but it's not perfect,\" said Prater.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Family_Foundation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaiser Family Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/03/20/d9ac6e6b-891f-4461-9fea-7e3a0c487d13/thumbnail/1200x630/8a22eb15153337830ed22789447e6b91/milk.jpg?v=1da0267dcfd5e1d387d4678a648e733c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Here's what that means", "body": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand -- and stop -- the growing outbreak.\n\nSo far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people.\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested -- with negative results -- before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nWHY IS THIS OUTBREAK SO UNUSUAL?\n\nThis strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too.

If those tests come back positive, herd owners will need to provide data on the movements of those cattle so investigators can trace the disease.\n\nThat should help stem the spread of the virus and help officials \"better understand this disease,\" Mike Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said during a media briefing, the New York Times reported.\n\nEver since a highly contagious form of bird flu was detected in the United States back in 2022, federal officials have reassured Americans that the threat to the public remained low. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, which suggests the virus has been spreading much more widely among cattle than thought. The results of tests to determine whether any live virus is in the milk supply are expected in the coming days, FDA officials added.\n\nSo far, no changes have been seen in the virus that would help it spread easily among people, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday, the Times reported. States have been monitoring 44 people who were exposed to the virus, Shah added.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the outbreak had spread to 33 herds in nine states, according to the USDA. But just one human infection has been reported, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild.\n\nShah said the federal government was relying on local officials and health workers to communicate with dairy producers and their workers, including veterinarians who have close relationships with people who might be hesitant to open up to strangers.\n\n\"There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health, to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themselves as being from the government in some way,\" Shah explained.\n\nMore from this section How much did COVID-19 lockdowns delay young kids' development? Study suggests evening exercise best for obese people Majority of American moms and dads feel lonely and burned out\n\nWhile it isn't clear when the bird flu outbreak among cows began, an analysis of genetic data suggests wild birds may have passed the virus to cows as early as last December. Cows were not believed to be vulnerable to bird flu, and it was late March before federal officials first announced the virus had been detected in sick cows in Texas and Kansas.\n\nWhile testing more cows is critical, reducing the risk of infection among dairy workers exposed to raw cow milk is paramount, said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nIf a worker were splashed with raw, infected milk in the nose or eyes and become sick, that would give the virus new chances to start spreading among people, she explained.\n\nAlthough federal health officials said Wednesday they had reminded states that they could request protective worker equipment from the national stockpile, Lakdawala said the risks of worker infections were already serious enough that farms should mandate the use of face shields.\n\nShe said other steps, like two-week 'stay-at-home' orders for infected cows, could also lower the need for more drastic measures.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on bird flu.\n\nSOURCES: U.S. Department of Agriculture, news release, April 24, 2024; New York Times\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAs bird flu

It comes as officials say the risk to the public remains low.\n\nBird flu virus has been detected in raw milk, federal agencies reported this week, but added that the nation's commercial milk supply remains safe.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a joint statement assured consumers that milk from cows infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza is destroyed or diverted, and that the pasteurization process, used for the vast majority of milk, \"kills harmful bacteria and viruses.\"\n\nThe FDA also noted that while pasteurization \"is likely to inactivate the virus ... the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles.\"\n\n\"Therefore, some of the samples collected have indicated the presence\" of the virus, it said, but additional testing to determine if the virus was viable showed \"nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\n\"Pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health,\" the FDA said, reiterating longstanding recommendations that consumers avoid drinking raw milk.\n\nOn Wednesday, the USDA issued an order to prevent the spread of the virus by requiring that dairy cows test negative for bird flu before they can be moved to other states. The agency also required veterinarians, laboratories and producers to report any positive test results.\n\nMore: Two vets hundreds of miles apart, both ISU grads, solve dairy cow sickness whodunit\n\nThe USDA's directive came after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas became sick with highly pathogenic avian influenza in March, marking the first time the virus had moved from poultry to cattle.\n\nSince 2022, state and federal officials have worked with producers to destroy 90.7 million chickens, turkeys and other birds nationally to contain the disease. Though the disease is deadly to birds, infected dairy cows mostly experience reduced appetite and milk production before recovering.\n\nThe virus has been discovered in 33 dairy operations in six states in addition to Kansas and Texas, the USDA said: Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and South Dakota. Iowa has no known cases ow of avian influenza in dairy cows or birds, the Iowa Department of Agriculture said Wednesday.\n\nOver the past two years, about 18.8 million birds have been destroyed in Iowa, the nation's top egg producer and seventh-largest turkey producer, USDA data shows. The last bird flu detection in the state was Dec. 20, and so far no cases have been reported among cattle.\n\nHere's what you should know about the highly pathogen avian influenza outbreak.\n\nHow is the disease spreading?\n\nWild birds can spread highly pathogenic avian influenza to domestic birds and other animals through their droppings and saliva. The virus has been detected in more than a dozen wild mammals, including brown, black and polar bears, bobcats, grey seals and bottlenose dolphins. In Iowa, the virus has been detected in red foxes and Virginia opossums.\n\nMore: The bird flu has jumped to foxes, bears and other mammals. Are humans next?\n\nHow is the avian influenza virus spreading in cows?\n\nThe USDA says the virus has spread between cows in the same herd; from cows to poultry; and between dairies associated with cattle movements. It also says cows without symptoms have tested positive.\n\nWhat about Iowa's large livestock population?\n\nIowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig urged the state's dairy and poultry producers to bolster their biosecurity to prevent the virus from entering their operations. Poultry producers have been on high alert since an initial wave of bird flu in 2015, when they were forced to destroy 32.7 million birds.\n\nScott Hayes, the former National Pork Producer Council president, told reporters this month that avian influenza is on producers' radar. But the Missouri farmer said the industry already has adopted strict biosecurity measures to guard against deadly diseases like African swine fever. That's an important issue in Iowa, the nation's largest pork producer.\n\nIowa allows raw milk sales. Is it dangerous?\n\nIowa for Fresh Milk couldn't immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. National group A Campaign for Real Milk said the federal agencies provided \"no supporting evidence of viral transmission from raw milk to humans in the peer-reviewed literature.\"\n\nThe FDA said it continues to recommend the dairy industry not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, given limited information about the possible transmission via raw milk.\n\nIs bird flu from dairy cows a threat to people?\n\nOne person in contact with an infected herd in Texas became mildly ill, the CDC said. The USDA reported being on alert, though. Last week, a microbiologist detected \"a shift\" in a virus sample from a Kansas cow that could have indicated it had \"an adaptation to mammals.\" Further CDC analysis, however, showed it had been \"seen previously in other mammalian infections and does not impact viral transmission.\"", "source": {"uri": "desmoinesregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Des Moines Register"}, "authors":

If those tests come back positive, herd owners will need to provide data on the movements of those cattle so investigators can trace the disease.\n\nThat should help stem the spread of the virus and help officials \"better understand this disease,\" Mike Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said during a media briefing, the New York Times reported.\n\nEver since a highly contagious form of bird flu was detected in the United States back in 2022, federal officials have reassured Americans that the threat to the public remained low. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that inactive viral fragments had been found in pasteurized milk, which suggests the virus has been spreading much more widely among cattle than thought. The results of tests to determine whether any live virus is in the milk supply are expected in the coming days, FDA officials added.\n\nSo far, no changes have been seen in the virus that would help it spread easily among people, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday, the Times reported. States have been monitoring 44 people who were exposed to the virus, Shah added.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the outbreak had spread to 33 herds in nine states, according to the USDA. But just one human infection has been reported, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild.\n\nShah said the federal government was relying on local officials and health workers to communicate with dairy producers and their workers, including veterinarians who have close relationships with people who might be hesitant to open up to strangers.\n\n\"There may be owners that are reluctant to work with public health, to say nothing of individual workers who may be reluctant to sit down with somebody who identifies themselves as being from the government in some way,\" Shah explained.\n\nWhile it isn't clear when the bird flu outbreak among cows began, an analysis of genetic data suggests wild birds may have passed the virus to cows as early as last December. Cows were not believed to be vulnerable to bird flu, and it was late March before federal officials first announced the virus had been detected in sick cows in Texas and Kansas.\n\nWhile testing more cows is critical, reducing the risk of infection among dairy workers exposed to raw cow milk is paramount, said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nIf a worker were splashed with raw, infected milk in the nose or eyes and become sick, that would give the virus new chances to start spreading among people, she explained.\n\nAlthough federal health officials said Wednesday they had reminded states that they could request protective worker equipment from the national stockpile, Lakdawala said the risks of worker infections were already serious enough that farms should mandate the use of face shields.\n\nShe said other steps, like two-week 'stay-at-home' orders for infected cows, could also lower the need for more drastic measures.", "source": {"uri":

What does that mean? - ExBulletin", "body": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of avian influenza in dairy cattle in an urgent effort to understand and contain the growing outbreak.\n\nSo far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change and spread more easily between people.\n\nThe virus, known as H5N1 type A, has been detected on nearly 30 dairy farms in eight states. Inactive virus remains have been found in milk at grocery stores. Testing also shows the virus is spreading among cattle, including those that do not show symptoms, and between cattle and birds, according to the USDA.\n\nStarting Monday, under the terms of a new federal order, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the United States will have to be tested and receive a negative result before they can be moved between states.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation.\n\nThis strain, known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in numerous mammals around the world. Most of them were wild animals such as foxes and bears that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also showing up in farmed mink. It is also found in aquatic mammals such as harbor seals and porpoises. The virus has also been found in polar bears in northern Alaska.\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants (goats and then dairy cows) in the United States this spring, surprising many scientists who have been studying the virus for years.\n\n\"When you think about influenza A, cows don't usually come up in the conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nInfluenza viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new strains, so the detection in dairy cows raises concerns that it could spread to humans, Webby said.\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cattle in March, after weeks of reports from dairy farms that their cattle had become ill. Symptoms include fatigue, a sudden decrease in breast milk production, and changes in the milk, which becomes thick and yellow in color.\n\nMatthew Aliota, a veterinary researcher at the University of Minnesota, said the discovery of virus remnants in milk on the market suggests that \"this situation has been going on for longer and is more widespread than previously realized.\" This suggests that there is.\"\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials this week released new genetic data on the outbreak.\n\nMichael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, said the data omitted some information about when and where the samples were taken, but the virus likely spread from birds to cattle late last year. He said that it was shown that.\n\nSince then, the infection has spread among cows and between farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks and milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nThe cows then spread the virus to the birds.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as it can be,\" Worobey said. \"The birds sampled at these farms clearly have mammalian-adapted viruses.\"\n\nExperts said the USDA's plan to require testing of cattle is a good start.\n\n\"We need more surveillance to know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a professor of virology at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to test every herd. He said agricultural authorities not only need to check for active infections, but also whether cattle that show past infection have antibodies to the virus.\n\n\"This is a very accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nExperts said further testing of workers who have been exposed to infected animals is also important. Experts say some farm owners and some independent workers are reluctant to cooperate with public health officials during the outbreak.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps characterize the scope of the problem, but also helps avoid potential negative effects.\"\n\nScientists will now analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety. They say they are working on it. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public does not need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said raw or unpasteurized milk should be avoided.\n\nDairy farm workers should also consider special precautions such as masks, hand washing and changing work uniforms, Aliota said.\n\nCDC officials said 23 people have been tested for the virus during the dairy cow outbreak, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection. At least 44 people who had contact with infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nDavid O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, compared the recent bird flu outbreak to tornado watches and warnings.\n\n\"There are some elements that need to exist for there to be a threat, and we're not there,\" he said. As with Tornado Watch, \"it won't change anything about how you go about your daily life, but it might make you a little more aware that something is going on.\"\n\nMr Worobei said this was \"the kind of epidemic that we were hoping would not be ignored after COVID-19\". But it happened. \"\n\nHe said ambitious testing was needed \"to potentially catch something like this quickly and nip it in the bud.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Education Media Group.

Some have already been cleared and started producing milk again for commercial consumption.\n\nFor now, authorities say drinking pasteurized milk is safe.\n\nBird flu was initially confirmed in raw milk from cows with the virus and authorities had claimed no milk with the influenza would enter the food supply due to measures such as pasteurization.\n\nRegulators declined to say from which states or states the milk that tested positive came.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anorexia (symptom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Pelvic_Exams_and_Pap_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Pelvic Exams and Pap Tests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/11/id5626747-nm-cows-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 129, "textEnd": 137}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 365, "textEnd": 373}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 2350, "textEnd": 2357}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Here's what that means - Sentinel Colorado", "body": "Here's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nU.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand -- and stop -- the growing outbreak.\n\nSo far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people.\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested -- with negative results -- before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nWHY IS THIS OUTBREAK SO UNUSUAL?\n\nThis strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska.\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants -- goats and then dairy cows -- in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.\n\n\"When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nFlu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.\n\nHOW LONG HAS BIRD FLU BEEN SPREADING IN COWS?\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.\n\nFinding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \"suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\" said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.\n\nThe data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.\n\nSince then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nAnd then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\" Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\"\n\nWHAT DO SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT EFFORTS TO TRACK THE OUTBREAK?\n\nSeveral experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.\n\n\"We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.\n\n\"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nMore testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\"\n\nHOW BIG A RISK DOES BIRD FLU POSE FOR PEOPLE?\n\nScientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nAlso, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.\n\nSo far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nWHAT ARE SCIENTISTS' CONCERNS FOR THE FUTURE?\n\nDavid O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.\n\n\"There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we're not there,\" he said. As with a tornado watch, \"you wouldn't change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.\"\n\nWorobey said this is the kind of outbreak \"that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.\"\n\nHe said ambitious screening is needed \"to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Since cases were confirmed in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas in late March, 33 farms in eight states have identified cases.\n\nThe new order is part of a slate of measures the government is taking to address H5N1 flu, which has been devastating to bird populations and recently begun to infect an increasing number of mammals, potentially bringing it a step closer to being able to spread efficiently between people.\n\nThe USDA said at a multiagency news conference Wednesday that the new order would help it get more information on the growing outbreak.\n\n\"There has been a little bit of reluctance for some of the producers to allow us to gather information from their farms,\" said Dr. Michael Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or APHIS.\n\n\"With the federal order going into place, this is going to really help us address any gaps that might exist.\"\n\nThe order will require that dairy cattle moving between states be tested for avian flu or any type of influenza A before they can travel. No dairy cattle positive for avian flu may move between states without conditions specified by APHIS, Watson said.\n\nRight now, the order doesn't apply to cattle raised as beef, but the USDA said that could change as it learns more about how the virus is spreading. Experts currently believe the virus is being spread through infected milk.\n\nWatson said the order also gives the government the authority to go to a facility where cattle have tested positive and follow up with additional testing and investigation if needed.\n\n\"Requiring a positive test reporting will help USDA better understand the disease, and testing before interstate movement will limit the spread of the virus,\" he said.\n\nThe tests have to be sent to a lab, and it could take several days to get results, Watson said, but the government is working on developing rapid tests that could give results more quickly on the farm.\n\nThe order says the US government will pay for the cost of testing for H5N1 for farms, even if animals don't have symptoms.\n\nThe H5N1 virus spreading in cows has not been shown to spread from person to person, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the public health risk is low. Only one person, a farmworker in Texas, has tested positive in connection to the outbreak. The CDC says 22 other people have been tested for the virus, and states are monitoring 44 others who were considered exposed and at risk of infection.\n\nThe CDC said it is looking into the possibility of monitoring wastewater for the virus, but many farms are not on municipal systems, and there are questions about whether contamination from birds or other infected wildlife might make the results unusable.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it had picked up traces of genetic material from the virus in milk from grocery store shelves.\n\nThe FDA and the CDC have long warned against the dangers of drinking raw or unpasteurized milk because of the possibility that it may carry dangerous germs.\n\nThe FDA doesn't believe that pasteurized dairy products can lead to infections, but it's running confirmatory tests to make sure.\n\n\"We anticipate results from those studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,\" Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said during Wednesday's news conference.\n\nPrater declined to say where the milk that showed traces of the virus had been purchased or how widespread the outbreak might be.\n\n\"We don't have information yet to share, but it will be coming out very shortly,\" he said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

What's going on? Is dairy safe?", "body": "The CDC is issuing a new health alert after recent bird flu outbreaks among cattle. It comes as officials say the risk to the public remains low.\n\nFragments of the virus that causes bird flu have been found in samples of pasteurized milk, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday, but officials aren't concerned about danger to humans from drinking store-bought milk at this time.\n\nOfficials told reporters on Wednesday that the milk tested positive for presence of the virus, but the results do not indicate that the virus is currently infectious, as the pasteurization process works to inactivate viruses.\n\nThe initial positive samples came from a limited number of tests done by researchers on milk at grocery stores. Federal agencies are now doing their own, more robust tests. The FDA said it is conducting further analysis on the positive samples, and is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state partners to investigate.\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" Donald Prater, the acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, told reporters.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials announced a new federal order that will require all dairy cattle to be tested for bird flu before being transported across state lines. Any cows that test positive will have to wait 30 days and retest before being moved, said administrator for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Michael Watson.\n\nThe avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has recently infected herds of dairy cows in several states, including Texas, Kansas and Michigan. Herds in New Mexico and Idaho are presumed infected, officials said.\n\nBoth the FDA and the USDA said the current commercial milk supply is safe because of the pasteurization process and the \"diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows.\"\n\nThe agency pledged to take the situation seriously and release results from multiple studies in the coming days or weeks.\n\nCan cats get bird flu? How to protect them and what else to know amid the outbreak\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nAvian influenza, or bird flu, is a disease that's caused by an avian influenza Type A virus infection, according to the CDC.\n\nThe disease primarily spreads through contact with infected birds, which can infect their respiratory tract and intestines, according to the CDC. Infected birds can shed viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Bird flu is very contagious among birds, and some of the viruses can sicken or kill certain domesticated species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys.\n\nIs anyone at risk from drinking milk?\n\nPasteurized milk -- which makes up 99% of milk produced on dairy farms and sold in stores -- is treated to make sure any viruses in the milk are dead. Experts say drinking this kind of milk is safe, even if fragments of bird flu have been found in some samples.\n\nHowever, raw milk does not receive this treatment.\n\nIs raw milk safe to drink?\n\nThe FDA says people should not drink raw milk. The agency also says the dairy industry shouldn't manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including cheese made with raw milk, from any cows showing symptoms of illness or exposed to other cows that have bird flu.\n\nHow did virus fragments get into milk?\n\nWhile the pasteurization process is designed to make milk safe by inactivating viruses, it doesn't destroy the virus fragments.\n\n\"It's important to understand that fragments, such as genetic material, of those pathogens can still be found in pasteurized milk,\" Prater said. Still, \"pasteurization is very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1 in milk from cows and other species.\"\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that current studies on how effectively pasteurization kills off bird flu virus are underway, but the process has proven effective in similarly acting viruses for decades, and thermal inactivation has been successful at inactivating bird flu in eggs, which occurs at a lower temperature than in milk.\n\nThe FDA and its partners are testing samples of milk from store shelves and conducting further analysis on any that show they have bird flu virus to ensure that the virus fragments are inactive, Prater said. Those results will be available in the coming days, he said.\n\nWhat is pasteurization?\n\nNamed after the scientist Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is a treatment process that applies heat to liquids for short amounts of time, according to the Virginia Department of Health. The process destroys pathogenic microorganisms in some foods and beverages that can cause spoilage and prolongs storage time.\n\nPasteurization was adopted by the FDA as a public health measure to kill dangerous bacteria and viruses, and largely eliminates the risk of getting sick from milk. In 1987, the FDA prohibited the interstate sale of raw, or unpasteurized milk.\n\nCan humans get bird flu?\n\nThere have been a few cases of humans being infected with various strains of bird flu, usually through close contact with sick or dead animals. But experts say the risk to humans is currently low because the disease has not mutated to spread person-to-person.\n\nThere have been two human cases in the U.S. tied to this strain of bird flu. Among them: On April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu after close contact with infected cows. The CDC said the only symptom reported by the patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis.\n\nPublic health officials told reporters that 23 people have been tested for bird flu during the current outbreak among cattle and 44 people are being actively monitored after suspected exposure.\n\nOfficials say risk to public health remains low. The CDC says most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said \"we have not observed changes to the virus' genetic makeup that would suggest an enhanced the ability to spread to humans or among humans.\"\n\n\"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, previously told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pereira, University of California, Davis; Robert B. Moeller, University of California, Davis; Terry W. Lehenbauer, University of California, Davis, and Todd Cornish, University of California, Davis\n\nThe discovery of viral fragments of avian flu virus in milk sold in U.S. stores suggests that the H5N1 virus may be more widespread in U.S. dairy cattle than previously realized.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration was quick to stress on April 24, 2024, that it believes the commercial milk supply is safe. However, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus can make cows sick, and the flu virus's presence in herds in several states and now new federal restrictions on the movement of dairy cows between states are putting economic pressure on farmers.\n\nFive experts in infectious diseases in cattle from the University of California, Davis - Noelia Silva del Rio, Terry Lehenbauer, Richard Pereira, Robert Moeller and Todd Cornish - explain what the test results mean, how bird flu can spread to cattle and the impact on the industry.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that the presence of viral fragments of H5N1 doesn't indicate the presence of intact virus particles that could cause disease.\n\nThe commercial milk supply maintains safety through two critical measures:\n\nThe viral fragments were detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing, which is known for its exceptional sensitivity in detecting even trace amounts of viral genetic material. These fragments are only evidence that the virus was present in the milk. They aren't evidence that the virus is biologically active.\n\nTo evaluate whether the presence of the viral fragments corresponds to a virus with the capacity to replicate and cause disease, a different testing approach is necessary. Tests such as embryonated egg viability studies allow scientists to assess the virus's ability to replicate by injecting a sample into an embryonated chicken egg. That type of testing is underway.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the FDA said it had found no reason to change its assessment that the U.S. milk supply is safe. The agency does strongly advise against consuming raw milk and products derived from it because of its inherent risks of contamination with harmful pathogens, including avian flu viruses.\n\nCurrently, cows confirmed to have H5N1 have different symptoms than the typical flu-like symptoms observed in birds.\n\nAbnormal milk and mastitis, an inflammatory response to infection, are common. While there is speculation that other bodily secretions, such as saliva, respiratory fluids, urine or feces, may also harbor the virus, that has yet to be confirmed.\n\nHow waterfowl or other birds transmitted H5N1 to cattle is still under investigation. In 2015, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in commercial poultry farms reached its peak in April and May, the same time birds migrated north. Birds can shed the virus through their oral, nasal, urine and fecal secretions. So the virus could potentially be transmitted through direct contact, ingesting contaminated feed or water, or inhaling the virus.\n\nInfected dairy cows can shed the virus in milk, and they likely can transmit it to other cows, but that still needs to be proven.\n\nContagious pathogens that cause mastitis can be transmitted through milking equipment or contaminated milker's gloves. Ongoing research will help determine whether this is also a potential transmission route for H5N1, and if so, what makes the virus thrive on mammary tissue.\n\nFor the dairy industry, infection of cattle with H5N1 avian influenza virus creates challenges at two levels.\n\nThe overriding concern is always for the safety and healthfulness of milk and dairy products.\n\nExisting state and federal regulations and industry practices require sick cows or cows with abnormal milk to be segregated so that their milk does not enter the food supply. Proper pasteurization should kill the virus so that it cannot cause infection.\n\nThe American Association of Bovine Practitioners has also developed biosecurity guidelines for H5N1, focusing on key practices. These include minimizing wild birds' contact with cattle and their environment, managing the movement of cattle between farms, isolating affected animals, avoiding feeding unpasteurized (raw) colostrum or milk to calves and other mammals, and ensuring the use of protective personal equipment for animal caretakers.\n\nThe other major concern is for the health of the dairy herd and the people who take care of the dairy cattle. A farm worker who handled dairy cows contracted H5N1 in Texas in March 2024, but such cases are rare.\n\nNo vaccines or specific therapies are available for avian influenza infections in dairy cattle. But following good sanitation and biosecurity practices for both people and cows will help to reduce risk of exposure and spread of the avian influenza virus among dairy cattle.\n\nFor cows that get the virus, providing supportive care, including fluids and fever reducers as needed, can help them get through the illness, which can also cause loss of appetite and affect their milk production.\n\nDairy farms facing an outbreak will have economic losses from caring for sick animals and the temporary reduction in milk sales. Approximately 5% to 20% of the animals in the affected herds have become ill, according to early estimates. Affected animals typically recover within 10 to 20 days.\n\nAt least 21 states have restricted importing dairy cattle to prevent the virus's spread, and the federal government announced it will require that lactating dairy cattle be tested before they can be moved between states starting April 29, 2024. While the overall impact on U.S. milk production is projected to be minor on an annual basis, it could lead to short-lived supply disruptions.\n\nThe federal government's monitoring and food safety measures, along with pasteurization, provide important safeguards to protect the public from potential exposure to avian influenza virus through the food chain.\n\nDrinking raw milk, however, does represent a risk for exposure to multiple diseases, including H5N1. This is why the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly recommend drinking only pasteurized milk and dairy products.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

Since then, infected cows have been confirmed in more than 30 farms across eight states. Scientists have said the USDA is sharing too little information about the virus and too slowly.The infected cows stopped eating as much as they usually did, and their milk became thickened and discolored. Veterinarians running tests on the animals found that the milk was teeming with the virus, although samples from their lungs didn't show much evidence of infection, leading the doctors to believe that the animals' mammary glands were directly infected, perhaps through shared milking equipment.Researchers are still trying to determine how cows initially became infected and how the virus is spreading between animals.Cats that have lived on the same farms as infected cows have died, perhaps after exposure to their milk.The FDA said Tuesday that milk from sick cows is being \"diverted or destroyed,\" while milk sold in interstate commerce is being pasteurized, a process that heats it briefly to kill microbes.\"Even if virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health,\" the FDA stated.The agency said 99% of milk in the commercial supply comes from farms that follow the pasteurized milk ordinance, \"which includes controls that help ensure the safety of dairy products.\" However, it was noted that pasteurization doesn't render milk completely sterile.For that reason, it has been running tests on milk samples collected at grocery stores across the country. It is also collaborating with the food safety group at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The FDA has long recommended that consumers not drink unpasteurized or raw milk because of the possibility that it may harbor germs that can pose serious health risks.So far, efforts to track the spread of the current outbreak have relied on voluntary reporting.The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service keeps a list of diseases that are required to be reported in animals. Although avian influenza, or bird flu, is required to be reported in poultry and wild birds, reporting is not required in cattle.\"No one ever thought it was going to be in cows,\" said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's coordinating center for studies on the ecology of influenza at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.\"You wouldn't even think of an H5N1 in cows being something you'd ever have to worry about, and I think that's where it's fallen through the cracks a little bit.\"Not only does the USDA require reporting of H5N1 in poultry, it rewards producers for reporting the first sign of illness in their flock and financially compensates them for birds and eggs that are destroyed to contain an outbreak. This approach has encouraged farmers to be forthcoming with information, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.There are no such policies in place to encourage reporting in other livestock.Osterholm said his major worry is that the outbreak could spread to pigs, since farms that keep cows often keep other types of animals, too.Flu viruses enter cells through sialic acids, which serve as entry points. Right now, the H5N1 virus hasn't learned to efficiently access the human version of the sialic acid receptor.Pigs have the same sialic acid receptors as both birds and humans in their respiratory tracts. If H5N1 causes a large outbreak in pigs, Osterholm said, it would give the virus a perfect opportunity to learn to attach to human sialic acids.\"Pigs are a more efficient mixing bowl,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics, molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \"The one thing about where we are in Texas is that, in addition to those cattle, Texas is the epicenter of the feral hog population.\"\"In the United States, we have 30% of the nation's feral hogs, 2 to 3 million feral hogs, and so that to me is a potential risk, as well,\" he said.The USDA said it has encouraged farmers and ranchers to report cases of sick cattle to state animal health officials.But neither cows nor the people who work or live around them are being widely screened for the infection, which would require informed consent. Testing of wastewater in areas with outbreaks is also being discussed.Instead, the CDC is monitoring emergency department data and flu testing data in areas where H5N1 viruses have been detected in dairy cattle for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu or conjunctivitis. \"So far, these data remain in expected ranges, and to date, surveillance systems do not show any unusual trends or activity,\" according to information in a statement compiled by officials at the CDC.CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said that 23 people with exposures to H5N1 had been tested, including one person in Texas who previously tested positive.

A person exposed to cattle tested positive for the disease and suffered conjunctivitis.\n\nDr. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, said based on new information, it appears that infections with the H5N1 virus in dairy cattle occurred through a single transmission event from a bird to a cow sometime in late 2023, likely in December.\n\nWorobey and colleagues analyzed genetic sequences of the virus released by the USDA over the weekend.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration reported on Tuesday that it found bird flu virus particles in some pasteurised milk samples, but said it remains safe for human consumption as such milk has been heated to a high temperature to kill harmful bacteria and viruses.\n\nVilsack said the US milk supply is safe \"based on the information we currently have available,\" adding that no live virus has been found.\n\nMilk containing bird flu particles entered the commercial supply from asymptomatic cows that were found to be infected through testing, he said.\n\nUSDA has carried out more than 2,000 tests on cattle samples over the last several weeks, Vilsack said.\n\nDairy cows must test negative for influenza A virus, which includes bird flu, at an approved laboratory before being shipped across state lines, the USDA said. Owners of cows that test positive will be required to provide epidemiological information, including animal movement tracing, the department said.\n\nThe agency plans to initially focus testing on lactating cows.\n\nRichard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, said testing cows about to be transported will help.\n\n\"If we can control the virus moving with those cows, then absolutely we're going to be better off,\" Webby said.\n\nPositive flu tests will prohibit cows from being moved for 30 days and until they test negative, Vilsack added. Dairy cattle appear to recover from bird flu, a disease often lethal to chickens and turkeys.\n\n\"Over the last several weeks, USDA has noted spread between cows within the same herd; spread from cows to poultry; spread between dairies associated with cattle movements; and cows without clinical signs that have tested positive,\" Vilsack said.\n\nUSDA estimates it will need about $500 million to continue to address outbreaks in dairy cows, commercial poultry flocks, wild birds and potentially other species.\n\nIt is finalising a request to transfer money from the Commodity Credit Corporation, which provides funds from the US Treasury to help stabilize agricultural prices and support farm income.\n\nThe Meat Institute, which represents US meat processors, urged USDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct additional testing to ensure beef remains safe to eat and to protect meatpacking workers from infection. USDA said it is confident the meat supply is safe.\n\nThe CDC maintained its low risk assessment for the general public after USDA microbiologists on April 16 \"identified a shift in an H5N1 sample from a cow in Kansas that could indicate that the virus has an adaptation to mammals,\" the USDA said.\n\nThe finding had been seen previously in other mammals and does not impact viral transmission, according to the department.\n\nThe USDA in a statement said it \"has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans and between people.\"", "source": {"uri":

They stressed that such remnants pose no known risk to people or the milk supply.\n\n\"The risk to humans remains low,\" said Dawn O'Connell of the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.\n\nThe new order requires every lactating cow to be tested and post a negative result before moving to a new state. It will help the agency understand how the virus is spreading, said Michael Watson, an administrator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\n\"We believe we can do tens of thousands of tests a day,\" he told reporters.\n\nUntil now, testing had been done voluntarily and only in cows with symptoms.\n\nAs The Epoch Times' Zachary Steiber reported earlier, commercially available milk from grocery stores has tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on April 23.\n\nThe FDA said in a statement it has been testing milk from cattle that have been sickened with the influenza, commonly known as the bird flu or H5N1, as well as milk \"in the processing system, and on the shelves.\"\n\n\"Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however, the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles. Therefore, some of the samples collected have indicated the presence of HPAI using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing,\" the agency said.\n\nWhile samples tested positive, that does not mean they contain an intact pathogen, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Additional testing is required to determine whether intact pathogen is still present and if it remains infectious, which determines whether there is any risk of illness associated with consuming the product,\" the FDA said.\n\nThe agency is injecting samples into fertilized chicken eggs to see whether any active virus replicates, among other experiments. It is also completing testing on samples taken from pasteurized milk from across the nation.\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe. Results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks,\" the FDA said.\n\nThe agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment for more details, including how many samples tested positive and which stores the milk that tested positive came from.\n\nBird flu has been confirmed in 33 herds of cattle in eight states after spreading to ruminants for the first time in the United States earlier this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. One person, a farm worker in Texas, has also tested positive for the influenza.\n\nU.S. authorities previously said that milk from diaries with sickened animals was \"being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the food supply\" and that \"pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk,\" but critics noted the authorities produced no evidence of testing to back up their position.\n\n\"There could be viruses in the milk on grocery shelves right now,\" Gail Hansen, a veterinary expert who was formerly the state public health veterinarian for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and Andrew deCoriolis, executive director of the group Farm Forward, wrote in a recent op-ed.\n\nMs. Hansen said on the social media platform X that the FDA finding virus particles was \"a little bit better than finding whole virus\" but was \"still not good.\"\n\nRick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, noted the shifting language from the government. The FDA now says that pasteurization \"is very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses like H5N1 in milk from cows and other species.\"\n\nIt also acknowledged that \"no studies on the effects of pasteurization on HPAI viruses (such as H5N1) in bovine milk have previously been completed,\" although it pointed to previous studies on effective pasteurization.\n\nYaneer Bar-Yam, president of the New England Complex Systems Institute, said the findings mean \"milk from sick cows is being used\" in the commercial supply. While pasteurization likely makes the milk safe, that safety is \"not guaranteed,\" he added.\n\nSome experts emphasized that, at present, there were no indications that the positive tests meant the virus detected was infectious.\n\n\"There is no evidence to date that this is [an] infectious virus and the FDA is following up on that,\" Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University, told the Associated Press.\n\nBut Angela Rasmussen, a virologist, said on X that the positive samples \"suggests there are undetected herds shedding virus into the milk supply\" because they show intact virus \"was once present.\"", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The virus is far more disruptive to the poultry industry, killing chickens and forcing mass culling of flocks. It generally causes mild or no sickness in cows. But greater transmission in mammals, particularly one regularly exposed to people, increases the risk that the virus could evolve to the point that it spreads more easily in humans.\n\nAn order issued by the U.S. Agriculture Department that takes effect Monday requires every lactating dairy cow to be tested before moving across state lines. Cows carrying the virus would have to wait 30 days and test negative before being moved, officials said. Positive test results would trigger additional requirements for herd owners to disclose information, including the movement of animals, to aid epidemiologic investigations, and for laboratories and state veterinarians to report cases to the USDA.\n\n\"Requiring positive test reporting will help USDA better understand this disease and testing before interstate movement will limit the spread of the virus,\" Mike Watson, administrator of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters.\n\n\"This is an evolving situation, and we are treating it seriously and with urgency,\" he said.\n\nThe testing mandate could help overcome reluctance from some milk producers to allow testing in their herds, Watson said. The cost of mandatory testing would be reimbursed by the agency. Watson said federal officials are also working with state counterparts to potentially expand testing of cows when they are moved within a state.\n\nThe nation has roughly 8 million lactating cows, according to estimates, though it's unclear how often they are moved across state lines. Watson did not provide an estimate for how many cows would be tested under the new order, though he described it as a \"significant number.\" He said labs have enough capacity to handle the increase and turn around results within days.\n\nThe National Milk Producers Federation, an industry group, called the USDA's testing order \"appropriate.\"\n\n\"Dairy farmers stand ready to take a proactive approach to ensuring that we better understand the spread of the virus, do what we can to limit that spread, and ensure the health of our animals and workers,\" Gregg Doud, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.\n\nVoluntary testing protocols for cows, limited until now to those with symptoms, has drawn criticism from public health experts. They say the true toll of the virus is probably larger than official tallies confirming avian flu in dairy cows in eight states, as well as one human case in a Texas farmworker. That person has recovered.\n\n\"We are only really starting to understand the extent of it now,\" said Angela Rasmussen, principal research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. \"The testing requirements are very warranted because certainly there are economic incentives for producers to not test.\"\n\nTesting uncovered fragments of the virus in milk sold at grocery stores, another sign that the virus is more prevalent in cows than official tallies show, including in asymptomatic cows. Federal officials stressed that existing research suggests pasteurization of milk and other milk products such as ice cream and cheese renders the virus unable to infect humans. Additional reviews, including the virus's presence in other dairy products such as cream, are underway, with some results expected within days or weeks.\n\n\"We have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" said Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration. He also cautioned, \"We also know that assessments can change as we learn more, and we will be transparent about any changes based on emerging data.\"\n\nPublic health experts have also faulted the Biden administration for not sharing more data about the outbreak, warning that it could hinder scientific research and the global response.\n\nFederal officials shared more than 200 genetic sequences of the virus taken from different animals, which scientists criticized for lacking metadata that provides crucial context, such as the location and timing of the specimen collection. Scientists who analyzed the sequencing said the available information strongly suggests that the spread of H5N1 to cows stems from a single spillover event from birds in late 2023.\n\n\"The evolutionary tree resoundingly indicates that this outbreak had a single origin and that it had been circulating under our noses for months before it was noticed,\" said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Arizona who led the analysis. \"It shows there are massive gaps in the system, and we need to do much better on the scientific side.\"", "source": {"uri":

The virus has caused serious or fatal infections among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. It has long been on the list of viruses with pandemic potential, and any expansion to a new mammal species is concerning.\n\nThe infections in cattle are from the same subtype of bird flu that has been infecting wild birds and poultry flocks globally for more than two years, also killing several mammal species that likely contracted the virus from consuming sick or dead birds.\n\nHOW WIDESPREAD IS THE BIRD FLU OUTBREAK IN CATTLE?\n\nThe full extent remains unknown, but several recent developments suggest it may be in more herds than documented.\n\nOn April 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it has detected particles of H5N1 in the milk supply. Tests suggest they are remnants of virus killed during the pasteurization process, and that the milk is safe. Early testing has not detected any live virus in milk samples, and U.S. health officials believe people cannot get sick from drinking pasteurized milk and warn not to drink unpasteurized milk.\n\nOfficials have learned the virus can be present in cows that show no signs of infection, and milk from those cows does not show signs of infection such as being thicker and yellow.\n\nTo contain the outbreak, the U.S. government is requiring dairy cattle moving between states to be tested for bird flu.\n\nWHEN DID THIS BIRD FLU OUTBREAK START?\n\nU.S. officials had thought the outbreak was recent, but new information suggests it may have started late last year.\n\nAfter the U.S. Department of Agriculture released some raw genetic data onto a public database on April 21, a team of evolutionary biologists led by Dr. Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona pieced together the viral genetic codes.\n\nThe team mapped the outbreak by tracking changes in the virus as it spread among herds. Based on their analysis, Worobey said in an April 24 interview that the outbreak in dairy cattle occurred through a single transmission event from a bird to a cow in late 2023, likely in December.\n\nHOW IS H5N1 SPREADING?\n\nIt is still unclear how the virus is spreading, but there is evidence of wild bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow, cow-to-poultry, and one case of cow-to-human transmission. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\nBecause of the heavy viral load in milk and mammary glands, scientists suspect the virus is being spread to animals during the milking process, either through contact with infected equipment or with virus that becomes aerosolized during cleaning procedures.\n\nWhether the virus can spread through respiratory droplets that infect the airway, as flu viruses typically spread in humans, remains unclear.\n\nIS THERE A BIRD FLU VACCINE FOR HUMANS?\n\nThe U.S. has a stockpile of bird flu vaccines matched with the strain currently circulating, as well as antivirals that could be used to treat human infections. For a major epidemic or a pandemic, the U.S. would have to scale up considerably.\n\nFlu vaccine suppliers Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline and CSL Seqirus have said they are monitoring avian flu and stand ready.

The disease, which is very contagious and often fatal in avian populations, has spread to herds in at least eight states. At least one person who was in contact with presumably sick animals also caught the virus.\n\nBut government officials and scientific experts say so far there is no evidence of infectious virus in pasteurized milk.\n\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Jeanne Marrazzo said Wednesday in a call with reporters that tests conducted on retail milk showed that there was genetic material from the virus.\n\nEfforts to grow the virus from those samples indicated that the virus was not infectious or \"alive,\" Marrazzo said, adding that testing was only conducted on a small set of samples.\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the FDA said in a statement.\n\nPasteurization has been used in the U.S. for decades to kill harmful bacteria and viruses in milk, but pasteurization may not erase all traces of a virus.\n\nSome genetic material may be left behind after the pasteurization process, such as DNA or RNA, the \"instructions\" that tell the virus what to do, according to Cornell University food science professor Samuel Alcaine.\n\n\"A car gets in an accident. It's no longer functioning. You can't drive it. It doesn't do anything that a car does. But you sift through the rubble and you could still find the instruction manual that tells it how to work,\" he said.\n\nAlcaine said that's likely what's happening with bird flu in milk: Tests show the virus used to be there, but it's no longer able to cause an infection.\n\nThe FDA said there haven't been any studies specifically on whether pasteurization inactivates bird flu in cow's milk because bovine infections are so new. However, it added that previous studies have shown that pasteurization is \"very likely to effectively inactivate heat-sensitive viruses, like H5N1\" and that pasteurization has inactivated bird flu in eggs, a process that occurs at a lower temperature than for milk.\n\nThe FDA said it detected bird flu in milk using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests, which \"do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers.\"\n\nFurther evaluation of milk samples will be done using egg inoculation tests, the FDA said, which it called the \"gold-standard for determining viable virus.\" The agency said it would release the results from multiple studies within days or weeks.\n\n\"There are no safety concerns,\" Alcaine said of milk with traces of bird flu. \"I'm still buying my milk from my local grocery store.\"\n\nFederal officials emphasize that any milk from infected cows is supposed to be discarded or destroyed and not enter the human food supply.\n\nOn top of that, any milk sold via interstate commerce in the U.S. is required to be pasteurized. The FDA has encouraged consumers not to drink raw, unpasteurized milk.\n\nBut Alcaine said influenza is generally not transmitted through food, and the more pressing concern is protecting people like farm workers, who could come into close physical contact with infected animals.\n\nIn an attempt to further contain the outbreak, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced an order Wednesday that requires dairy cows to test negative for bird flu before they can be moved across state lines, among other measures.", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inoculation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/304f813/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3996x2098+0+949/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2024%2F04%2F24%2Fgettyimages-1244715362_sq-b5a2cc3debb25c948fd554bab20549a2c218fca6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Here's what that means", "body": "U.S. health and agriculture officials are ramping up testing and tracking of bird flu in dairy cows in an urgent effort to understand -- and stop -- the growing outbreak.\n\nSo far, the risk to humans remains low, officials said, but scientists are wary that the virus could change to spread more easily among people.\n\nThe virus, known as Type A H5N1, has been detected in nearly three dozen dairy herds in eight states. Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested -- with negative results -- before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nThis strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska.\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants -- goats and then dairy cows -- in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.\n\n\"When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nFlu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.\n\nFinding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \"suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\" said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.\n\nThe data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.\n\nSince then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nAnd then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\" Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\"\n\nSeveral experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.\n\n\"We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.\n\n\"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nMore testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\"\n\nScientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nAlso, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.\n\nSo far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nDavid O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.\n\n\"There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we're not there,\" he said. As with a tornado watch, \"you wouldn't change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.\"\n\nWorobey said this is the kind of outbreak \"that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.\"\n\nHe said ambitious screening is needed \"to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Several of the entities do not anticipate significant disruptions to the supply chain of milk, including factors like availability and price, but some states are still responding to the developing virus situation by imposing restrictions and requiring veterinary clearances on cows before they cross state lines.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA explained how pasteurization, a process that uses heat to kill harmful bacteria in milk and cheese, is very likely to kill the infectious qualities of the virus and is one of the biggest reasons that even milk with a virus present can be regarded as safe to consume. \"There continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the FDA wrote, \"because products are pasteurized before entering the market.\"\n\nThe FDA uses two different methods to test samples of milk, according to Donald Schaffner, a professor of food science at Rutgers University. To test for viral presence, the agency uses a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test. It uses a process called egg inoculation to test if a virus is infectious.\n\nIn the PCR test, Schaffner told Fortune, \"the FDA is looking for the nucleic acid from the virus, but just because something contains viral nucleic acid doesn't mean that it contains infectious virus.\" To figure out if it's infectious, he said, the FDA identified egg inoculation tests as the gold standard. The process involves taking a sample of milk that contains the virus and putting it into an egg. \"If the virus is infectious, it will grow in the egg,\" Schaffner said. According to the FDA's statement, these tests are currently underway and those results will be made available in the \"next few days to weeks,\" but still, the department added, \"we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\nWhile research on how pasteurization effects this particular avian virus is limited, largely because this disease has never been detected in cattle before, several federal agency staff and food science experts agree that pasteurization is very likely to neutralize any infectious quality of the virus since the process has been previously studied in chicken eggs. From those prior experiments, Schaffner confirmed, \"egg pasteurization gets rid of the virus in eggs,\" adding that dairy milk is subjected to \"a more severe pasteurization process than for eggs.\"\n\nThe FDA concurred, writing that inactivation of infectious qualities of the avian flu has been \"successful during the pasteurization process for eggs, which occurs at lower temperatures than what is used for fluid milk,\" and that the process has \"proven effective for decades against a wide range of pathogens.\"\n\nAs of today, strains of the virus have been detected in 33 herds of cows from eight states including Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas, according to the Agriculture Department.\n\nIn Texas, the virus has been widespread, affecting around 40% of cattle herds in the state's panhandle in March. Since then, according to Sid Miller, the commissioner of Texas's department of agriculture, about 10% of the state's cows were at one point infected with the virus, and most recovered within a week. Disinfecting milking machines after each use, he said, has now helped his state's farmers report zero cases of infections in the last four weeks.\n\n\"That's just cowboy logic,\" Miller said, but stated the extra cleaning has been instrumental in reducing the state's case count of infected cows.\n\nThe cause of the virus in cows is not clear yet, according to several of the agencies. The virus situation is \"very much still emerging,\" Nicole Martin, an assistant research professor in dairy foods microbiology at Cornell University, told Fortune, adding that there are many unanswered questions dairy industry experts and infectious disease scientists are trying to answer. The symptoms of infected cows are analogous to a person with a cold or flu virus and cows often recover within a week or two, Martin said.\n\nThe avian virus is a much more common, and deadly, issue for poultry flocks-and can be so dangerous that infected birds are often killed to prevent its spread. Between 2022 and 2023, almost 60 million chickens and turkeys were killed on American farms for prevention purposes, but there's no such recommendation to kill cattle since they experience much milder symptoms. The disease has also spread to other species in the past, including seals and sea lions, but infections in humans are exceedingly rare.\n\nThe most serious symptom in cows, Martin said, is decreased milk production-and in rare cases, a permanent depletion of milk.\n\nOn an individual small farm, she explained, if 20% of cows \"have clinical signs of this disease, which would mean a temporary reduction in the amount of milk they're making,\" that could make a big impact. However, she said, \"we don't anticipate a major supply chain issue.\"\n\nMore concerning, she said, is the virus spreading between cows in transport across the country. Moving animals from one herd to another is \"somewhat commonplace across the industry,\" Martin said, \"and there's a lot of states now implementing restrictions of cautionary steps prior\" to the animals' travels.\n\nOn Monday, New York State announced new temporary import requirements for dairy cattle coming in from other states. The requirements prohibit the entry of cows from areas with confirmed cases of the avian flu or areas under investigation in relation to the flu, and requires cows from affected states to have a certificate of clearance of the avian flu, issued by a veterinarian within 10 days of its entry into the state.\n\nThe certificate, Martin said, \"has to include specific language that relates to this highly pathogenic avian influenza.\" In her view, the mild nature of the illness, in combination with these protocols, suggest \"it does not appear that there will be a major impact on the milk production overall,\" across the country.\n\nNew York joins 21 other states that have implemented avian flu-related restrictions, namely Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nThe FDA asked farmers to monitor dairy cows for signs of illness \"to ensure that milk from sick cows does not enter into interstate commerce,\" and called for those who identify sick cows to work with state animal health officials to test milk samples.\n\nAcross the board, FDA officials and professors say, there is little cause for concern over nation-wide milk shortages, price hikes, or another widespread pandemic.\n\n\"For a consumer, there's no reason to be concerned about consuming milk in the marketplace,\" Martin said. \"I continue to do so, and all of my colleagues continue to do so.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki",

Experts see little risk", "body": "The discovery of traces of the bird flu virus in pasteurized cow milk in the United States sparked questions over whether the disease could spread to humans, but experts say there is little risk from food contamination.\n\nUS authorities on Tuesday said that they had discovered traces of bird flu virus in the cow milk supply during the course of a large study, but the samples likely posed no health risk to humans.\n\nAn outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has spread among dairy cattle herds throughout the United States and infected one human, who had mild symptoms, authorities said.\n\nThough the H5N1 strain of HPAI has killed millions of poultry during the current wave, affected cows have not fallen severely sick.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration said that during the course of a national survey, it had discovered viral particles in \"milk from affected animals, in the processing system, and on the shelves\".\n\nBut the samples were run through a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test, which is able to detect remnants of the pathogen's genetic material -- though the virus itself was inactivated by the heat of the pasteurization process.\n\nThe bird flu A/H5N1 strain first appeared in 1996 but since 2020 the number of contaminated bird populations has exploded, and a growing number of mammals have since been infected.\n\nIn March, both cows and goats joined the list, a surprise for experts because until now the animals had not been considered at risk of catching this type of virus.\n\n\"In the United States, a new H5N1 virus has intermingled with local viruses, and has the ability to multiply extremely rapidly in a cow's udder,\" said Jean-Claude Manuguerra, director of the environment and infection risks department at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.\n\nBut even though H5N1 has killed millions of poultry during the current wave, infected cows have not become seriously ill.\n\nBased on studies to date, most experts say that even if the bird flu virus spreads to a human, the chances of widespread contamination are slim.\n\n\"Is the fact that virus traces have been found in cow milk worrying? No, although the fact that another animal is susceptible to contamination by this virus is not good news,\" said Bruno Lina, a virologist at the Lyon hospital in southeast France.\n\n\"There's a risk of random cases, in animals or humans. But we're not seeing any major mutation of the virus that would lead to a greater pandemic risk than three or four months ago,\" he said.\n\nUS authorities said earlier in April that a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to cattle.\n\nThe symptoms were mild, with only an eye infection, after being in direct contact with a cow.\n\n\"What we know is that the virus can cause in humans an infection in two specific places: an eye infection -- which is mild -- or in the pulmonary alveoli, the deepest parts of the lung,\" Lina said.\n\nIn the latter case, the infection can prove serious -- of the roughly 900 cases of H5N1 documented in humans over the past 20 years by the World Health Organization, half have ended in death.\n\nBut when it comes to drinking pasteurized milk, the risks drop to nearly zero even if virus traces are found.\n\n\"Pasteurization destroys the virus even if it doesn't eradicate every trace of its presence,\" Lina said.\n\nSeveral countries such as France are fond of their raw chesses, but experts note that the sanitary conditions of their production are strictly controlled.\n\n\"Has anyone ever been exposed to non-pasteurized milk contaminated by H5N1, and developed an infection by the normal means of consumption, the mouth or digestive tract? It's never been demonstrated,\" Lina said.\n\nAnd for now, the latest virus strain discovered in the United States is different from those currently circulating in Europe, said Manuguerra.\n\nAnd no H5N1 infections have so far been found in French cows for example, he said.\n\n\"The warning has been sounded, there is extra vigilance -- and these viruses can mutate so rapidly that you have to keep an eye on them,\" he added.\n\n\"But I think that consumers should absolutely not be worried.\"", "source": {"uri": "medicalxpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pasteur Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonary alveolus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2014/1-h5n1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles.\" The agency said it is continuing to investigate the outbreak, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state partners.\n\nThe FDA's statement continued: \"Nearly all (99%) of the commercial milk supply that is produced on dairy farms in the U.S. comes from farms that participate in the Grade 'A' milk program and follow the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO), which includes controls that help ensure the safety of dairy products.\n\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) virus, or bird flu, is a disease that's caused by an avian influenza Type A virus infection, according to the CDC. The virus has recently infected herds of dairy cows in several states, including Texas, Kansas and Michigan. Herds in New Mexico and Idaho are presumed infected. Both the FDA and the USDA said the current commercial milk supply is safe because of the pasteurization process and the \"diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows.\"\n\nBird flu is very contagious among birds, and some of the viruses can sick or kill certain domesticated species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys. According to the CDC, the disease primarily spreads through contact with infected birds, which can infect their respiratory track and intestines. Infected birds can shed viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces.\n\nEditorial credit: grandbrothers / Shutterstock.com", "source": {"uri": "wabcradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "77 WABC Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saliva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1494/2024/04/25100017/Shutterstock_1853126911767422.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It comes as officials say the risk to the public remains low.\n\nCHICAGO -- The U.S. government will require dairy cattle moving between states to be tested for bird flu starting on Monday as federal officials ramp up their response to an outbreak that has bled over into the U.S. milk supply.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Wednesday said all laboratories and state veterinarians in the country must report positive tests, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would pay for increased testing.\n\nThe measures aim to contain the spread of bird flu, which has been reported in eight states and 33 dairy herds since it was first detected in late March in Texas. A person exposed to cattle tested positive for the disease and suffered conjunctivitis.\n\nDr. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, said on Wednesday that based on new information, it appears that the H5N1 infections in dairy cattle occurred through a single transmission event from a bird to a cow sometime in late 2023, likely in December.\n\nWorobey and colleagues analyzed genetic sequences of the virus released by the USDA over the weekend.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported on Tuesday it found bird flu virus particles in some pasteurized milk samples, but said it remains safe for human consumption as such milk has been heated to a high temperature to kill harmful bacteria and viruses.\n\nUSDA's Vilsack said the U.S. milk supply is safe \"based on the information we currently have available,\" adding that no live virus has been found.\n\nMilk containing bird flu particles entered the commercial supply from asymptomatic cows that were found to be infectedthrough testing, he said.\n\nUSDA has carried out more than 2,000 tests on cattle samples over the last several weeks, Vilsack said.\n\nContaining spread of bird flu\n\nDairy cows must test negative for influenza A virus, which includes bird flu, at an approved laboratory before being shipped across state lines, the USDA said. Owners of cows that test positive will be required to provide epidemiological information, including animal movement tracing, the department said.\n\nThe USDA plans to initially focus testing on lactating cows.\n\nRichard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, said testing cows about to be transported will help.\n\n\"If we can control the virus moving with those cows, then absolutely we're going to be better off,\" Webby said.\n\nPositive flu tests will prohibit cows from being moved for 30 days and until they test negative, USDA's Vilsack said. Dairy cattle appear to recover from bird flu, a disease often lethal to chickens and turkeys.\n\n\"Over the last several weeks, USDA has noted spread between cows within the same herd; spread from cows to poultry; spread between dairies associated with cattle movements; and cows without clinical signs that have tested positive,\" Vilsack said.\n\nThe Meat Institute, which represents U.S. meat processors, urged USDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct additional testing to ensure beef remains safe to eat and to protect meatpacking workers from infection.\n\nThe CDC maintained its low risk assessment for the general public after USDA microbiologists on April 16 \"identified a shift in an H5N1 sample from a cow in Kansas that could indicate that the virus has an adaptation to mammals,\" the USDA said. The finding had been seen previously in other mammals and does not impact viral transmission, according to the department.\n\nThe USDA \"has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans and between people,\" according to a statement.\n\nLive cattle and feeder cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell on news of the USDA's plan to expand testing for dairy cows, even though traders were skeptical that the avian flu issue would impact beef cattle.\n\n\"The psychology is saying, 'This is bad,'\" said Rich Nelson, chief strategist for brokerage

Most recently, particles of the virus have been detected in pasteurized milk, but it's not a cause for worry, according to the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and several experts in food safety and risks.\n\nThe presence of the virus, even in pasteurized milk, doesn't necessarily signify safety concerns to people, according to a statement by the FDA, due to the pasteurization process, which very likely inactivates infectious qualities of the virus, and the agencies' work to divert and destroy milk from infected cows.\n\nThe FDA has been working closely with several other entities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state veterinary and public health officials, to investigate the virus, which now affects 33 cow herds in eight states, according to the Department of Agriculture. Several of the entities do not anticipate significant disruptions to the supply chain of milk, including factors like availability and price, but some states are still responding to the developing virus situation by imposing restrictions and requiring veterinary clearances on cows before they cross state lines.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA explained how pasteurization, a process that uses heat to kill harmful bacteria in milk and cheese, is very likely to kill the infectious qualities of the virus and is one of the biggest reasons that even milk with a virus present can be regarded as safe to consume. \"There continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply,\" the FDA wrote, \"because products are pasteurized before entering the market.\"\n\nThe FDA uses two different methods to test samples of milk, according to Donald Schaffner, a professor of food science at Rutgers University. To test for viral presence, the agency uses a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test. It uses a process called egg inoculation to test if a virus is infectious.\n\nIn the PCR test, Schaffner told Fortune, \"the FDA is looking for the nucleic acid from the virus, but just because something contains viral nucleic acid doesn't mean that it contains infectious virus.\" To figure out if it's infectious, he said, the FDA identified egg inoculation tests as the gold standard. The process involves taking a sample of milk that contains the virus and putting it into an egg. \"If the virus is infectious, it will grow in the egg,\" Schaffner said. According to the FDA's statement, these tests are currently underway and those results will be made available in the \"next few days to weeks,\" but still, the department added, \"we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\nWhile research on how pasteurization effects this particular avian virus is limited, largely because this disease has never been detected in cattle before, several federal agency staff and food science experts agree that pasteurization is very likely to neutralize any infectious quality of the virus since the process has been previously studied in chicken eggs. From those prior experiments, Schaffner confirmed, \"egg pasteurization gets rid of the virus in eggs,\" adding that dairy milk is subjected to \"a more severe pasteurization process than for eggs.\"\n\nThe FDA concurred, writing that inactivation of infectious qualities of the avian flu has been \"successful during the pasteurization process for eggs, which occurs at lower temperatures than what is used for fluid milk,\" and that the process has \"proven effective for decades against a wide range of pathogens.\"\n\nThe impact and scope of the avian virus on cattle\n\nAs of today, strains of the virus have been detected in 33 herds of cows from eight states including Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas, according to the Agriculture Department.\n\nIn Texas, the virus has been widespread, affecting around 40% of cattle herds in the state's panhandle in March. Since then, according to Sid Miller, the commissioner of Texas's department of agriculture, about 10% of the state's cows were at one point infected with the virus, and most recovered within a week. Disinfecting milking machines after each use, he said, has now helped his state's farmers report zero cases of infections in the last four weeks.\n\n\"That's just cowboy logic,\" Miller said, but stated the extra cleaning has been instrumental in reducing the state's case count of infected cows.\n\nThe cause of the virus in cows is not clear yet, according to several of the agencies. The virus situation is \"very much still emerging,\" Nicole Martin, an assistant research professor in dairy foods microbiology at Cornell University, told Fortune, adding that there are many unanswered questions dairy industry experts and infectious disease scientists are trying to answer. The symptoms of infected cows are analogous to a person with a cold or flu virus and cows often recover within a week or two, Martin said.\n\nThe avian virus is a much more common, and deadly, issue for poultry flocks -- and can be so dangerous that infected birds are often killed to prevent its spread. Between 2022 and 2023, almost 60 million chickens and turkeys were killed on American farms for prevention purposes, but there's no such recommendation to kill cattle since they experience much milder symptoms. The disease has also spread to other species in the past, including seals and sea lions, but infections in humans are exceedingly rare.\n\nThe most serious symptom in cows, Martin said, is decreased milk production -- and, in rare cases, a permanent depletion of milk.\n\nOn an individual small farm, she explained, if 20% of cows \"have clinical signs of this disease, which would mean a temporary reduction in the amount of milk they're making,\" that could make a big impact. However, she said, \"we don't anticipate a major supply-chain issue.\"\n\nMore concerning, she said, is the virus spreading between cows in transport across the country. Moving animals from one herd to another is \"somewhat commonplace across the industry,\" Martin said, \"and there's a lot of states now implementing restrictions of cautionary steps prior\" to the animals' travels.\n\nOn Monday, New York State announced new temporary import requirements for dairy cattle coming in from other states. The requirements prohibit the entry of cows from areas with confirmed cases of the avian flu or areas under investigation in relation to the flu, and require cows from affected states to have a certificate of clearance of the avian flu, issued by a veterinarian within 10 days of its entry into the state.\n\nThe certificate, Martin said, \"has to include specific language that relates to this highly pathogenic avian influenza.\" In her view, the mild nature of the illness, in combination with these protocols, suggest \"it does not appear that there will be a major impact on the milk production overall\" across the country.\n\nNew York joins 21 other states that have implemented avian-flu-related restrictions, namely Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nThe FDA asked farmers to monitor dairy cows for signs of illness \"to ensure that milk from sick cows does not enter into interstate commerce,\" and called for those who identify sick cows to work with state animal health officials to test milk samples.\n\nAcross the board, FDA officials and professors say there is little cause for concern over nationwide milk shortages, price hikes, or another widespread pandemic.\n\n\"For a consumer, there's no reason to be concerned about consuming milk in the marketplace,\" Martin said. \"I continue to do so, and all of my colleagues continue to do so.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

No, although the fact that another animal is susceptible to contamination by this virus is not good news,\" said Bruno Lina, a virologist at the Lyon hospital in southeast France.\n\n\"There's a risk of random cases, in animals or humans. But we're not seeing any major mutation of the virus that would lead to a greater pandemic risk than three or four months ago,\" he said.\n\nHuman health threat?\n\nUS authorities said earlier in April that a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to cattle.\n\nThe symptoms were mild, with only an eye infection, after being in direct contact with a cow.\n\n\"What we know is that the virus can cause in humans an infection in two specific places: an eye infection -- which is mild -- or in the pulmonary alveoli, the deepest parts of the lung,\" Lina said.\n\nIn the latter case, the infection can prove serious -- of the roughly 900 cases of H5N1 documented in humans over the past 20 years by the World Health Organization, half have ended in death.\n\nBut when it comes to drinking pasteurised milk, the risks drop to nearly zero even if virus traces are found.\n\n\"Pasteurisation destroys the virus even if it doesn't eradicate every trace of its presence,\" Lina said.\n\nWhat about raw milk?\n\nSeveral countries such as France are fond of their raw chesses, but experts note that the sanitary conditions of their production are strictly controlled.\n\n\"Has anyone ever been exposed to non-pasteurised milk contaminated by H5N1, and developed an infection by the normal means of consumption, the mouth or digestive tract? It's never been demonstrated,\" Lina said.\n\nAnd for now, the latest virus strain discovered in the United States is different from those currently circulating in Europe, said Manuguerra.\n\nAnd no H5N1 infections have so far been found in French cows for example, he said.\n\n\"The warning has been sounded, there is extra vigilance -- and these viruses can mutate so rapidly that you have to keep an eye on them,\" he added.\n\n\"But I think that consumers should absolutely not be worried.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nBird flu viral fragments found in pasteurized milk in US\n\nHuman cases of bird flu '

The virus is also known to have infected one farmworker, whose sole symptom was pink eye.\n\nThe viral fragments pose little risk to consumers who drink milk, David O'Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the New York Times.\n\n\"The risk of getting infected from milk that has viral fragments in it should be nil,\" he explained. \"The genetic material can't replicate on its own.\"\n\nFDA officials didn't elaborate on how many milk samples had tested positive or exactly where the samples came from, the Times reported.\n\nIf the fragments surfaced in samples throughout the commercial milk supply, it would suggest far more cows have been infected than believed, experts said.\n\n\"The problem in dairy cows might be much bigger than we know,\" O'Connor said. \"That would be the concern -- not that the milk itself would be a risk.\"\n\nFDA officials noted they are waiting on results from experiments that will determine whether the milk samples contain active virus.\n\nMost of the milk produced on U.S. farms is pasteurized, a process that typically kills germs with heat. Pasteurization should also inactivate flu viruses, which are known to be fragile and heat-sensitive, experts added.\n\nMore from this section Patient Gets First-Ever Pig Kidney Transplant Plus Heart Pump Study suggests evening exercise best for obese people There's an 'Epidemic' of Loneliness Among U.S. Parents, Poll Finds\n\nStill, the FDA has only recently begun testing pasteurization's effectiveness on H5N1, so the risks aren't fully known yet, the Times reported.\n\nBrian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, told the Times it would be \"very critical\" for health officials to clearly communicate the final findings and educate consumers about what they mean.\n\nBut experts still urged folks to stay calm.\n\n\"With a virus like this, I would have to believe even if you had the highest levels of virus activity you could ever imagine in the actual milk from the udder of an infected cow, it would be diluted millions of times over going into pasteurization,\" Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, told the Times.\n\nIngested milk is also broken down by the body's digestive and immune systems, so \"I wouldn't worry about [viral] remnants,\" Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, director of the Boston University Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases, told the Times. \"As long it's not a live virus, it is unlikely that there's any health risks.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on the bird flu.\n\nSOURCES: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, news release, April 23, 2024;

For that, the FDA is conducting additional testing to determine if milk samples contain viable virus that remains infectious -- the first time that scientists have studied the effect of pasteurization on highly pathogenic influenza viruses like H5N1, which is also referred to as \"H5N1 bird flu.\"\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the FDA said.\n\nStill, the finding raised questions about the tracking of pathogens in the nation's milk supply and how widespread the outbreak of H5N1 is in dairy cows. As of Monday, eight states had reported infected herds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas. One human case has also been reported, in Texas.\n\nThe CDC has advised states to prepare response plans for avian influenza, although it says the risk to human health remains low.\n\nOn Wednesday, the USDA announced several steps to limit the spread of H5N1 among cattle, including a requirement that dairy cattle receive a negative test for influenza A before crossing state lines. Owners of herds that include infected cows will have to provide information on the herd's movements, and labs and veterinarians will be required to report positive influenza A tests to the USDA.\n\nWe checked in with Andrew S. Pekosz, PhD, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology and vice chair of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, to gain a better understanding of the public health implications of the H5N1 outbreak in cows.\n\nHealio: In simple terms, what does finding particles of highly pathogenic avian influenza in pasteurized milk mean?\n\nPekosz: For the general public, concern should still be low because the tests are most likely picking up \"dead\" viruses in the milk.\n\nHealio: Is there anything about it that alarms you?\n\nPekosz: What concerns me is that this result means that milk from H5N1 infected cows did make it into the milk supply. Early reports about the milk from an infected cow being discolored and very thick [shows it can be] easily identified and taken out of the supply chain. Finding virus in the milk may mean that it is present in milk that looks otherwise normal and therefore wasn't caught by this visual inspection.\n\nHealio: Does finding genetic particles of H5N1 in milk signal danger to the American public?\n\nPekosz: No.\n\nHealio: Is there any reason for people to stop drinking milk?\n\nPekosz: No.\n\nHealio: The remnants were found in pasteurized milk. There are a lot of reasons not to drink raw milk, which the CDC says is among the riskiest foods to consume. Would you expect there to be live H5N1 virus in raw milk? Would that pose a risk to someone drinking it?\n\nPekosz: The safety of pasteurized milk compared with raw milk is clear, and in many ways, that validates how effective pasteurization is at killing lots of different microbes, many of which are more \"hearty\" or difficult to kill than an influenza virus. I would expect there to be live virus in the raw milk, given what we have heard about very strong signals for virus in the milk of cows that show severe symptoms of avian flu infection.\n\nIt's important to re-emphasize that there are a lot of other things in raw milk that can make people sick, so pasteurized milk is the safe way to consume milk. It would be nice to have data showing how well pasteurization works against this specific H5N1 virus -- and that data should be coming soon.\n\nHealio: What does finding H5N1 genetic material in milk mean in terms of how widespread infections are in cattle in the United States?\n\nPekosz: It will be important to do much more widespread testing of dairy cattle and milk produced on dairy farms to understand what the source of H5N1 in the milk is. It may be that the milk has virus in it before the cows show symptoms of infection like reduced milk production or thick, discolored milk. It wouldn't surprise me if an infected cow had virus in its milk for a day or two before changes in the milk quality could be identified.\n\nAnother theory is that cows that don't show symptoms of infection may be shedding virus into their milk. Detecting this would take a lot of testing of apparently healthy cows and their milk. Determining if cows can be infected and shed virus in milk when they show no, or only very mild symptoms will be critical.\n\nHealio: Do you believe that public health agencies in this country are acting appropriately to respond to the situation?\n\nPekosz: FDA testing and communication around its testing has been quite good. CDC is ready to respond to any potential infections in humans, so I think these public health agencies are responding well.", "source": {"uri": "healio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healio"},

Here's what to know about bird flu particles in dairy products. - The Boston Globe", "body": "But the agency, which did not specify where the contaminated samples were found, downplayed the public health threat, noting that the viral fragments have likely been inactivated by pasteurization. Pasteurization, a heat-treatment process that destroys microorganisms, is used on 99 percent of the commercial milk supply produced by US dairy farms.\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the agency said in its statement.\n\nSome experts complained that the advisory was vague and did not specify how many samples were collected, or where the infected samples originated.\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\nThere is no reason to stop consuming milk or dairy products, said Dr. Shira Doron, chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center. There's no research yet specifically measuring the ability of the pasteurization process to eliminate the H5N1 virus. But the process has been shown to work in every other similar virus tested to date. That makes it reasonable to assume it will be effective against H5N1.\n\n\"From my own personal standpoint and my family standpoint, I'm not at this point worried. We're going to continue to consume dairy products, beef, and chicken without any hesitation,\" she said. \"I don't think that there is any appreciable risk, at least based on the information I have so far.\"\n\nDoron notes that the influenza virus is usually transmitted through the airways, and there is little evidence to date suggesting that it can be contracted through the gastrointestinal system, such as after eating or drinking food contaminated with H5N1.\n\nBut Nuzzo said transmission of H5N1 through food can't be ruled out. \"They have found the virus in different organs, including the GI tract,\" she said. \"Is that likely to be a major source of infection? I mean, we've not seen major flu outbreaks from gastrointestinal exposure.\"\n\nThough it's too early to tell whether it is possible to contract H5N1 through unpasteurized products, Doron suggests consumers avoid unpasteurized dairy, including raw milk and raw milk cheese, because they are dangerous, even without H5N1.\n\n\"It's never a good idea to consume unpasteurized dairy products, because they could have other live viruses and bacteria that are potentially even more deadly,\" she said.\n\nIt is not known how the virus, spread from birds to cows. But Michael Worobey, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, analyzed 239 H5N1 sequences released Sunday night by the USDA for the first time. He said the virus appears to have jumped from a bird to a cow in Texas sometime around the end of 2023. It either had or acquired a mutation that allowed it to be transmitted from cow to cow, he said via email. The transmission mechanism remains a mystery.\n\n\"It could well have been a wild bird mixing with cattle and exposing them via feces,\" he wrote. \"Or a wild bird mixing with domestic poultry, duck, or geese, then the domestic birds exposing cattle. Lots of possibilities that can't be ruled out yet.\"\n\nJennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health, said some have speculated the disease spread across state lines through the transport of cows between farms. Some have also hypothesized that industrial machinery may somehow be \"aerosolizing\" the virus during the milking process. But she added: \"We just don't know. It's all hearsay, really. It's incredibly frustrating.\"\n\nNow that H5N1 has jumped into cattle, it is spreading far and wide, which is why some experts say the presence of genetic fragments of the virus in milk is not surprising. The disease, which is sometimes asymptomatic in cows, can also cause lethargy and a dramatic reduction in milk production. It appears to be far less lethal than it has been in commercial poultry. Most cows recover within two weeks.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the USDA had confirmed cases of highly pathogenic bird flu among dairy cattle in eight states: Kansas, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas. The virus has not been reported in dairy cattle in Massachusetts.\n\nBird flu is an influenza virus that primarily infects birds. It was first identified in China in 1996 in domestic waterfowl. In the years since, outbreaks of the highly infectious disease have resulted in the death or destruction of 60 million birds. Human cases are extremely rare.\n\nThe current strain of H5N1 is believed to have surfaced in 2020 in Europe, before spreading around the globe, killing millions of birds in the wild and on commercial poultry farms. By the summer of 2022, it had spread to mammals, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of seals and sea lions -- including more than 180 gray and harbor seals off the coast of Maine. The virus has also been found in cats, forest animals, raccoons, and skunks. In February, the virus was detected in a non-poultry, backyard flock of birds in Essex County. There have been additional reports of dead and dying wild Canada geese with symptoms of the current bird flu strain in Essex County and surrounding coastal areas.\n\nIn March, the US Department of Agriculture found it in cows for the first time on farms in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Idaho, and Michigan.\n\nTo date, only a single dairy worker has been identified as infected with the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1, and his only symptom was conjunctivitis, which Doron called \"reassuring.\"\n\nBut outbreaks of previous strains in humans have been more deadly.\n\nIn order for the virus to spread among humans, its shape would likely need to change to allow it to hook onto proteins on the surface of human cells, known as receptors, long enough to inject its genetic cargo into cells located in the human lungs, said Brown's Nuzzo.\n\nShe suggested the best way to prevent the spread would be to equip farm workers with personal protective equipment, including eye protection and masks and to require the equipment for those involved in milking. She also recommended vaccinating workers to prevent them from getting sick in the first place.\n\n\"That's probably one of the single best things we can do to prevent this virus from evolving to become a pandemic strain,\" she said.\n\nShe expressed frustration with the slow pace of information being put out by the federal government.\n\n\"I will just say it feels that the evidence generation process feels to me more oriented around minimizing damage to the reputation of the dairy industry and less about trying to stay ahead of the virus,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that viral particles are inactive and pose no threat to consumers.\n\nSince late March, H5N1 bird flu has spread to at least 33 dairy herds across eight states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This was a surprising development since it was the first time the virus had been seen infecting cows.\n\nThe virus has also infected a single farmworker, becoming the second person ever in the US to be infected, who experienced very mild symptoms.\n\nTo better understand the problem, health authorities have been monitoring the milk on shop shelves across the US. Last week, the World Organization (WHO) had detected \"very high concentrations\" of the virus in raw milk from infected animals. That is not necessarily surprising as unpasteurized milk can contain all kinds of bacteria and viruses.\n\nIn a new development, the FDA has revealed that samples of pasteurized milk in the US have tested positive for inactive remnants of the H5N1 virus. They did not reveal how many samples tested positive nor where the milk was sampled from. However, they did state that pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus and \"the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles.\"\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the FDA said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAlong with testing, the FDA and the US Department of Agriculture are working to divert and destroy milk from sick cows.\n\nNamed after French microbiologist Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is the process of heating up food to eliminate pathogens and extend its shelf life. Virtually all milk (99 percent) produced and sold in the US comes from farms that follow a strict pasteurization process, known as the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.\n\nAs a heat-sensitive virus, H5N1 should be inactivated by standard pasteurization techniques - at least in theory. However, bird flu infecting cows is a novel problem, so there are currently no studies on the effects of pasteurization of H5N1 in bovine milk.\n\n\"US government partners have been working with deliberate speed on a wide range of studies looking at milk along all stages of production - on the farm, during processing, and on shelves - using well-established methodologies used previously to confirm pasteurization effectiveness for known pathogens,\" the FDA said. \"This work is a top priority.\"", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microbiologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis Pasteur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelf_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelf life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/73953/aImg/75821/moooooooooooo-meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

(representational)\n\nParis:\n\nThe discovery of traces of the bird flu virus in pasteurised cow milk in the United States has sparked questions over whether the disease could spread to humans, but experts say there is little risk from food contamination.\n\nUS authorities on Tuesday said that they had discovered traces of bird flu virus in the cow milk supply during the course of a large study, but the samples likely posed no health risk to humans.\n\nWhat do we know?\n\nAn outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has spread among dairy cattle herds throughout the United States and infected one human, who had mild symptoms, authorities said.\n\nThough the H5N1 strain of HPAI has killed millions of poultry during the current wave, affected cows have not fallen severely sick.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration said that during the course of a national survey, it had discovered viral particles in \"milk from affected animals, in the processing system, and on the shelves\".\n\nBut the samples were run through a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test, which is able to detect remnants of the pathogen's genetic material -- though the virus itself was inactivated by the heat of the pasteurisation process.\n\nHow did it happen?\n\nThe bird flu A/H5N1 strain first appeared in 1996 but since 2020 the number of contaminated bird populations has exploded, and a growing number of mammals have since been infected.\n\nIn March, both cows and goats joined the list, a surprise for experts because until now the animals had not been considered at risk of catching this type of virus.\n\n\"In the United States, a new H5N1 virus has intermingled with local viruses, and has the ability to multiply extremely rapidly in a cow's udder,\" said Jean-Claude Manuguerra, director of the environment and infection risks department at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.\n\nBut even though H5N1 has killed millions of poultry during the current wave, infected cows have not become seriously ill.\n\nPandemic risk?\n\nBased on studies to date, most experts say that even if the bird flu virus spreads to a human, the chances of widespread contamination are slim.\n\n\"Is the fact that virus traces have been found in cow milk worrying? No, although the fact that another animal is susceptible to contamination by this virus is not good news,\" said Bruno Lina, a virologist at the Lyon hospital in southeast France.\n\n\"There's a risk of random cases, in animals or humans. But we're not seeing any major mutation of the virus that would lead to a greater pandemic risk than three or four months ago,\" he said.\n\nHuman health threat?\n\nUS authorities said earlier in April that a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to cattle.\n\nThe symptoms were mild, with only an eye infection, after being in direct contact with a cow.\n\n\"What we know is that the virus can cause in humans an infection in two specific places: an eye infection -- which is mild -- or in the pulmonary alveoli, the deepest parts of the lung,\" Lina said.\n\nIn the latter case, the infection can prove serious -- of the roughly 900 cases of H5N1 documented in humans over the past 20 years by the World Health Organization, half have ended in death.\n\nBut when it comes to drinking pasteurised milk, the risks drop to nearly zero even if virus traces are found.\n\n\"Pasteurisation destroys the virus even if it doesn't eradicate every trace of its presence,\" Lina said.\n\nWhat about raw milk?\n\nSeveral countries such as France are fond of their raw chesses, but experts note that the sanitary conditions of their production are strictly controlled.\n\n\"Has anyone ever been exposed to non-pasteurised milk contaminated by H5N1, and developed an infection by the normal means of consumption, the mouth or digestive tract? It's never been demonstrated,\" Lina said.\n\nAnd for now, the latest virus strain discovered in the United States is different from those currently circulating in Europe, said Manuguerra.\n\nAnd no H5N1 infections have so far been found in French cows, for example, he said.\n\n\"The warning has been sounded, there is extra vigilance -- and these viruses can mutate so rapidly that you have to keep an eye on them,\" he added.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"But I think that consumers should absolutely not be worried.\"\n\n(Except for the headline, this story

This is the key question for us,\" Donald Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.\n\nFDA officials announced earlier this week that testing on milk from grocery stores tested positive for the avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu.\n\nThe type of testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can detect the intact virus but can also detect residual genetic material from killed pathogens.\n\n\"There are not studies directly looking at avian influenza in bovine milk,\" Mr. Prater, a doctor of veterinary medicine, said Thursday.\n\nThe FDA initially said, after the bird flu crossed into cattle in March, that no commercially available milk would contain the virus because farmers were being directed to divert or destroy milk from sick cows, and because pasteurization would kill any remaining affected milk.\n\nThis week, the agency acknowledged uncertainty on the matter. \"Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nOfficials pointed to a study that reviewed previous research and found that pasteurization killed some other viruses in milk.\n\nThe FDA has refused to say how many samples from grocery stores tested positive and the source or sources of the samples.\n\nMr. Prater and other officials shed no new light on that front. Mr. Prater merely said that the FDA collected retail samples of \"various milk and milk products\" and that the U.S. Department of Agriculture tested the samples.\n\nMr. Prater said the FDA, other government agencies, and outside researchers are engaged in studies to answer a number of critical questions, including whether intact virus survives pasteurization.\n\n\"PCR-positive levels aren't necessarily indicative of live virus so it's important to understand what we're seeing in retail milk,\" he said.\n\nSome pasteurization experiments involve taking milk samples and applying different time and temperature combinations. One example is looking at whether high-temperature-short-time pasteurization, or 161.6 degrees Fahrenheit heat for 15 seconds, will kill the virus.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health is examining the impact of giving raw milk from sick cattle to rodents, while several other agencies are working on epidemiological investigations into cases of the virus.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed cattle-to-cattle transmission of the virus just weeks after the first cases in cattle were confirmed in Texas and Kansas. Experts say that the virus does transmit through milk.\n\nIt's still unclear how long the virus remains viable and the level of virus that makes milk infectious, according to Mr. Prater. He described not knowing as \"two really important data gaps that we have.\"\n\nAuthorities are advising farms with confirmed bird flu infections to discard milk from the animals in some way. They can also feed the milk to other animals but only after heat treatment at levels similar to those used in pasteurization.\n\nTesting so far has confirmed cases of H5N1, a strain of the avian influenza, in 33 cattle herds across eight states. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials told the conference Thursday that it and state partners have actively monitored 44 people in contact with sick animals and tested at least 23 people who showed symptoms, but only one human in Texas has tested positive so far.\n\nIn another bid to curb the outbreak, U.S. authorities recently ordered farmers to produce negative tests for the bird flu before moving cattle between states. Previously, testing was voluntary and only done on cows displaying symptoms, which include lethargy and discolored milk.\n\nThe action will \"help us get ahead of this disease and limit its spread,\" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.\n\nH5N1 originated in China among birds in the 1990s. The latest strain has been circulating in the United States since 2021. The virus infected numerous flocks of poultry before beginning to infect ruminants earlier this year.\n\nThere's no indication at present of transmission among humans and sequencing from the virus taken from the Texas patient showed no adaptations that would make the virus more transmissible to or among humans, CDC officials said Thursday. Analysis of the testing results suggests antivirals like Tamiflu used against influenza will work in human cases, Vivien Dugan, one of the officials, told the conference.\n\nIf more cases among humans appear and vaccines are cleared, then the vaccines would be expected to be at least as good as seasonal influenza shots, Ms. Dugan said. The seasonal shots often provide subpar protection against infection and better shielding against severe disease.\n\nFederal agencies are recommending people take steps such as not consuming raw milk, cheese, or meat from animals with suspected or confirmed H5N1 and avoiding exposure without protection to sick or dead animals or animal feces.\n\nFarmers and farm workers are being advised to carefully handle sick and dead animals. They should wear safety goggles and other equipment to prevent infection, according to the CDC. The agency said doctors should test people who might have H5N1 infections and, if tests return positive, pass on information to laboratories for further analysis.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethargy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lethargy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Vilsack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Vilsack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/id983273-cattles-AP24085768727367.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 189, "textEnd": 197}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Over the past three weeks, the number of states where cows infected with bird flu have been detected has risen from six to eight. A preprint posted on 16 April reported the discovery of the virus in raw milk from infected cows, and US federal authorities said on Wednesday that the virus had been found in lung tissue collected from a seemingly healthy cow.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, US officials confirmed at a media briefing that genomic material from the H5N1 strain, which is causing the outbreak, had been detected in milk sold in shops.\n\nDetection of viral particles in milk sold to consumers suggests that avian flu in cows could \"be more widespread than initially thought\", says food scientist Diego Diel at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \"Increased surveillance and testing in dairies should be an important part of control measures going forward.\" Nature looks at the implications for human health and the future of the outbreak.\n\nIt's still unclear how many milk samples the FDA has tested or where the samples were collected. The agency said that it would release more information in the coming days and weeks.\n\nAfter it leaves the farm and before it hits the shelves, milk is pasteurized to inactivate pathogens. To detect H5N1, the FDA used a test called quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which picks up viral RNA. Because it detects fragments of the viral genome, the test cannot distinguish between living virus and the remnants of dead virus, says dairy scientist Nicole Martin at Cornell University.\n\n\"The detection of viral RNA does not itself pose a health risk to consumers, and we expect to find this residual genetic material if the virus was there in the raw milk and was inactivated by pasteurization,\" she says.\n\nThe presence of viral material in commercially available milk does have broader implications, however. There are several possible explanations, says virologist Brian Wasik, also at Cornell University. It could be that the outbreak is more pervasive than farmers realized, and that milk from infected animals is entering the commercial supply. Another possibility, he says, is that \"asymptomatic cows that we are not testing are shedding virus into milk\". But it's also possible that both scenarios are true.\n\nUS federal rules require milk from infected cows to be discarded, but it's not yet clear whether cows often start shedding the virus before they look sick or produce abnormal milk. The 16 April preprint, which has not yet been peer reviewed, includes reports that milk from infected cows is thicker and more yellow than typical milk and that infected animals eat less and produce less milk than usual.\n\nThere is no definitive evidence that pasteurization kills H5N1, but the method kills viruses that multiply in the gut, which are hardier than flu viruses, says Wasik. \"Influenza virus is relatively unstable,\" he says, \"and is very susceptible to heat.\" Pasteurization of eggs, which is done at a lower temperature than pasteurization of milk, does kill H5N1.\n\nIt's possible that pasteurization would be less effective at killing relatively high viral concentrations in milk, says Wasik. Finding out whether this is the case requires experimental data. In the absence of a definitive answer, keeping milk from infected cows out of the commercial supply is extremely important.\n\nWhen Nature asked when to expect more evidence on whether pasteurization kills H5N1, Janell Goodwin, public-affairs specialist at the FDA in Silver Spring, Maryland, said that the agency and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) \"are working closely to collect and evaluate additional data and information specific to\" H5N1.\n\nUSDA researchers have tested nasal swabs, tissue and milk samples of cows from affected dairy herds and have found that milk contained the highest viral concentrations. This indicates that the virus could be spreading through milk droplets.\n\nIf so, milking equipment could be involved. \"The teat cups of a milking machine could transfer remnants of H5N1-containing milk from one cow to the teats of the next cow being milked,\" says virologist Thijs Kuiken at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. \"Even if they are washed and disinfected, the levels of virus in the milk of infected cattle are so high that one could not exclude the possibility of infectious virus being transferred from cow to cow by this route.\" In fact, in some equipment set-ups, workers spray down milking machines with high-pressure hoses to clean them, which would aerosolize any infected milk, says Wasik.\n\nThe USDA website concurs that viral spread is \"likely through mechanical means\".\n\nThe FDA announced on Wednesday that cows must test negative for bird flu before they can be moved across state lines. That might help to stem the outbreak, scientists say. Animals in the US dairy industry move around a lot, Wasik says. Calves are moved to be raised into milk cows, cows are moved when they stop producing milk and farmers sell the animals. Such movement is probably \"a main driver\" of the outbreak, Wasik says.\n\nDiel would like to see surveillance of bulk milk samples at farms. Wastewater testing and environmental sampling could be useful, too, Wasik says, particularly around farms near outbreaks or farms where cows have been moved. He also advocates for a quarantine or observation period of 24 or 48 hours when cattle are moved to a new farm.\n\nSuch surveillance measures \"could really buy us time, slow down the outbreak\", says Wasik, so researchers and agencies can \"get a better handle on it. Because time is what's of the essence.\"", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RNA virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parenchyma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ithaca, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ithaca, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spring,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver Spring, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Silver Spring, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01221-2/d41586-024-01221-2_27011244.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 229, "textEnd": 237, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

One dairy worker fell ill, increasing concerns about human risk levels.\n\nNow it's in the milk supply. On Tuesday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that genetic evidence of the virus had been found in commercially purchased milk. However, it's unclear whether the milk contains live virus or mere fragments of the virus that were killed by pasteurization, a process that destroys harmful bacteria, but remain detectable.\n\nThe FDA said it'll soon release a nationwide survey of tested milk and that for now, the commercial milk supply remains safe, a claim that numerous independent experts have confirmed.\n\nThe news that the bird flu has been found in the US milk supply may raise alarm among some consumers, and the FDA has been criticized for prematurely assuring the safety of milk without hard data. But the real problem, which has received little attention, is the tepid and opaque response from the federal agency tasked with stopping the on-farm spread of the disease: the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nEver since the virus was detected on a Texas dairy farm in late March, infectious disease experts around the world have roundly criticized the USDA on multiple fronts.\n\nIt took nearly a month for the agency to upload data containing genetic sequences of the virus, which scientists use to better understand its threat level. And once the sequence was uploaded, it was incomplete, lacking specifics that researchers say they needed to properly study the data.\n\n\"It's as if the USDA is intentionally trying to hide data from the world,\" Rick Bright, a former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told STAT. A Dutch virologist told STAT it should've taken the USDA days, not weeks, to share data and updates.\n\nBeyond the data obfuscation, there's insufficient monitoring. The virus may have started circulating on US dairy farms months before it was detected, according to Michael Worobey, a biology professor at the University of Arizona. That suggests the need for better and more proactive pathogen monitoring on the part of the USDA.\n\nAnd once H5N1 was confirmed in dairy cows, the USDA didn't require dairy farms to conduct routine testing nor report positive H5N1 tests. The USDA has even tolerated uncooperative farmers, despite the high stakes of the disease spread.\n\n\"There has been a little bit of reluctance for some of the producers to allow us to gather information from their farms,\" said Michael Watson, administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, in a press conference on Wednesday. But, he added, \"that has been improving.\"\n\nThis voluntary approach is a recurring theme in USDA policy; there's even uncertainty as to whether the agency is enforcing orders for farmers to toss milk from infected cows to ensure it doesn't wind up in the food supply, which could explain how traces of it were found in store-bought milk.\n\nLast week, the New York Times reported that North Carolina officials confirmed there were asymptomatic cows in the state, which could also explain why the virus was detected in the commercial milk supply. It also suggests more herds may be infected than previously thought.\n\nOn Wednesday, a month after the first confirmation, the USDA finally issued a federal order requiring that laboratories and state veterinarians report farms with positive H5N1 tests and that lactating dairy cows must test negative for bird flu before crossing state lines (and cooperate with investigators). At a Wednesday press conference, the agency didn't specify how the order will be enforced.\n\nThe USDA's sluggish response to a rapidly moving virus may leave some foreign observers scratching their heads. But much of it can be explained by an irresolvable conflict baked into its mission.\n\nThe agency, according to food industry scholars Gabriel Rosenberg and Jan Dutkiewicz, has \"the oxymoronic double mandate of both promoting and regulating all of American agriculture -- two disparate tasks that, when combined, effectively put the fox in charge of the henhouse.\"\n\nMore often than not, it's heavy on the promotion and light on the regulation.\n\nThe paradox has been at the center of its response to the bird flu's decimation of the US poultry industry in recent years. While the USDA is developing several bird flu vaccines, it's long been stubbornly opposed to a broad vaccination campaign due to industry fears that it'll disrupt trade, a major source of revenue for US poultry companies, despite pleas from experts to give birds a bird flu shot.\n\nUSDA has also been deferential to industry on matters of pollution, labor, political corruption, false advertising, and animal cruelty across numerous sectors. And it's not the only agency that too often takes a hands-off approach to problems stemming from food production.\n\nThe FDA has failed to stringently regulate antibiotics used in animal farming, a pressing public health threat that, in recent years, some European regulators have addressed in earnest. Agriculture is a top source of US water and air pollution, due in large part to congressional loopholes and weak enforcement on the part of the US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIt all adds up to what food industry experts call \"agricultural exceptionalism,\" in which the food industry operates under a different set of regulations than the rest of the economy. The justification of such exceptionalism is that it's necessary, given the importance of an abundant food supply.

The latest was another Idaho dairy on April 19.\n\nVilsack said the focus remains on lactating dairy cows because that is when cows are testing positive. Vilsack also said USDA will cover the costs of the tests.\n\nThe testing order does not apply to beef cattle and USDA so far has not found any positive H5N1 infections in beef cattle.\n\nAt least one dairy cow going to slaughter was asymptomatic, but USDA tested the cow's lung and it came back positive. The cow was condemned and did not enter the food supply.\n\nH5N1 SPREADING MULTIPLE WAYS IN DAIRY COWS\n\nIn terms of spreading, USDA has noted spread between cows in the same herd, spread from cows to poultry and spread between herds, and now more testing has found asymptomatic cows that are positive without any signs of illness. Watson said there is likely spread due to mechanical transmission on farms such as from equipment in dairy parlors.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said there have been at least eight instances in which a dairy farm has infected an adjacent poultry farm. USDA officials said that was validated because the sequence of the virus was identical on both the dairy farms and the poultry operations.\n\n\"This is a novel circumstance that's not been confronted before, that's why there's a premium in knowledge and information and testing,\" Vilsack said.\n\nFEDERAL RESPONSE RAMPING UP\n\nThe tests showing fragments of the virus in commercial dairy products moved federal officials to open up Wednesday about what they know.\n\nOfficials held two separate press calls Wednesday. FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, along with USDA, held a call to talk about the safety of the milk supply and increased testing of dairy products. USDA then held a separate call to discuss the department's federal order on dairy cow testing and movement.\n\nFDA reported Tuesday that samples of tested milk products had found genetic material of the H5N1 virus, but pasteurization had destroyed the effectiveness of the virus.\n\nDon Prater, FDA acting director of Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said the positive finding of the H5N1 virus in dairy products has prompted the FDA to conduct a nationwide testing program for dairy products.\n\n\"We take this current situation and the safety of the milk supply very seriously. FDA and USDA have indicated that based on information currently available, our commercial milk supply is safe because both of the pasteurization process and the diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows. This remains the case right now.\n\nWhen asked about how destroyed fragments of the H5N1 virus got into commercial dairy products, Vilsack pointed out cows with symptoms of the virus produced milk that is discolored and thicker than normal milk and that milk is being destroyed. But cows that were asymptomatic did not show those signs.\n\n\"We do know there were asymptomatic cows -- cows that had the virus but didn't necessarily exhibit any sign that milk ... didn't necessarily give any indication that it had had virus,\" Vilsack said.\n\nVilsack added it's important to reiterate that the virus did not survive pasteurization.\n\nPRODUCER GROUP RESPONSE\n\nThe National Milk Producers Federation called USDA's testing actions \"appropriate\" due to the presence of virus in dairy herds and the focus on both human and animal health.\n\n\"Today's announcements and actions underscore that continued concern and focus on the well-being of animals and those who care for them,\" said Gregg Doud, president and CEO of NMPF.\n\nDoud added that USDA, FDA and scientific research has established that the consumer milk supply is safe. Pasteurization renders the H5N1 virus, like other viruses, inactive, an important reminder to consumers of its value as a basic safeguard for human health. \"We appreciate that these agencies are sharing this message, which will help alleviate any concerns consumers may have.\"\n\nUSDA's federal order: www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dairy-federal-order.pdf\n\nAlso see, \"FDA Finds Fragments of HPAI Virus in Pasteurized Milk Samples,\" https://www.dtnpf.com/...\n\nChris Clayton can be reached at Chris.Clayton@dtn.com\n\nFollow him on social platform X @ChrisClaytonDTN", "source": {"uri": "dtnpf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DTN Progressive Farmer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_clayton@dtnpf.com", "name": "Chris Clayton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Vilsack", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Vilsack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beef cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Dairy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Dairy", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.dtnpf.com/mydtn-public-core-portlet/servlet/GetStoredImage?category=CMS&symbolicName=cow_dsc_3757.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 538, "textEnd": 546}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

How to protect them and what else to know amid the outbreak\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nAvian influenza, or bird flu, is a disease that's caused by an avian influenza Type A virus infection, according to the CDC.\n\nThe disease primarily spreads through contact with infected birds, which can infect their respiratory track and intestines, according to the CDC. Infected birds can shed viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Bird flu is very contagious among birds, and some of the viruses can sick or kill certain domesticated species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys.\n\nWhat is pasteurization?\n\nName after the scientist Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is a treatment process that applies heat to liquids for short amounts of time, according to the Virginia Department of Health. The process destroys pathogenic microorganisms in some foods and beverages that can cause spoilage and prolongs storage time.\n\nPasteurization was adopted by the FDA as a public health measure to kill dangerous bacteria and largely eliminate the risk of getting sick from milk. In 1987, the FDA prohibited the interstate sale of raw, or unpasteurized milk.\n\nCan humans get bird flu?\n\nOn April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu after close contact with infected cows. The CDC said the only symptom reported by the patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis.\n\nOfficials say risk to public health remains low. The CDC says most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals.\n\n\"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, previously told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.registerguard.com",

However, experts emphasize that the likelihood of food contamination posing a significant health risk is minimal.\n\nUS authorities disclosed on Tuesday that they identified traces of bird flu virus in the cow milk supply during a comprehensive study, yet they reassured that these samples posed negligible health risks to humans.\n\nAn outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has affected dairy cattle herds across the United States, resulting in one human infection with mild symptoms, according to authorities.\n\nDespite the H5N1 strain of HPAI causing extensive poultry fatalities in the current wave, afflicted cows have not exhibited severe illness.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration reported that viral particles were found in \"milk from affected animals, in the processing system, and on the shelves\" during a nationwide survey. However, these samples underwent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing, capable of detecting remnants of the virus's genetic material, although the virus itself was neutralized by pasteurization heat.\n\nThe bird flu A/H5N1 strain emerged in 1996, but since 2020, the prevalence of contaminated bird populations has surged, with an increasing number of mammals, including cows and goats, being infected.\n\nIn March, cows and goats were unexpectedly added to the list of susceptible animals, surprising experts who previously considered them unlikely to contract this virus.\n\n\"In the United States, a novel H5N1 virus has mixed with local strains, exhibiting rapid multiplication in a cow's udder,\" explained Jean-Claude Manuguerra, director of the environment and infection risks department at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.\n\nDespite the significant poultry casualties caused by H5N1 in the ongoing outbreak, infected cows have not displayed severe symptoms.\n\nAccording to current research, most experts believe that even if the bird flu virus transmits to humans, the likelihood of widespread transmission remains low.\n\n\"Should we be concerned about finding traces of the virus in cow milk? No, although the susceptibility of another animal to this virus contamination is concerning,\" remarked Bruno Lina, a virologist at Lyon Hospital in southeast France.\n\n\"We might see sporadic cases in animals or humans, but there's no evidence of significant virus mutation that would elevate pandemic risk compared to three or four months ago,\" he added.\n\nIn early April, US authorities reported a case of bird flu infection in a person working on a dairy farm in Texas. The individual experienced mild symptoms, including an eye infection, following direct contact with a cow.\n\n\"The virus can cause infection in humans in two specific areas: a mild eye infection or

A federal order will develop critical baseline information to limit the virus spread.\n\nSo far, the USDA said, no changes to the virus have been found that would make it transmissible to humans and between people.\n\n\"While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, our partners at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believe that the current risk to the public remains low,\" the USDA said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nUSDA said, \"The novel movement of H5N1 between wild birds and dairy cows requires further testing and time to develop a critical understanding to support any future courses of action.\"\n\nUSDA added that it \"has identified spread between cows within the same herd, spread from cows to poultry, spread between dairies associated with cattle movements, and cows without clinical signs that have tested positive. On April 16, APHIS microbiologists identified a shift in an H5N1 sample from a cow in Kansas that could indicate that the virus has an adaptation to mammals.\"\n\nAccording to USDA, the Centers for Disease Control has conducted further analysis on that and it did not change their overall risk assessment for the general public. That's because what was observed has been seen before in other mammalian infections and \"does not impact viral transmission.\"\n\nThe USDA said beginning April 29 interstate movement of dairy cattle will require a negative test for influenza A virus and owners of cattle testing positive will have to provide \"epidemiological information, including animal movement tracing.\"\n\nThe tests will be immediately required for lactating cattle. The testing requirements for other classes of dairy cattle will be based on scientific factors on the virus and the evolving risk profile, according to the USDA.\n\nMandatory reporting also will be required when laboratories and state veterinarians get positive influenza A nucleic acid detection results. The same mandatory reporting will apply to positive influenza A serology diagnostic results in livestock.\n\nDue to rapid spread of the H5N1 virus in April, a Texas poultry facility stopped production and was ordered to cull 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets -- or young female chickens- - at Cal-Maine's Parmer County facility near the New Mexico border.\n\nIn July, a bird flu outbreak hit the Welsh coastline, killing hundreds of seabirds in one of Britain's most important seabird habitats.\n\nIn February, Harvard Law school researcher professor Ann Linder and New York University professor Dale Jamieson warned the U.S. had \"blind spots\" in strategies to deal with threats like bird flu.\n\nThe researchers said the United States originates more zoonotic diseases than any other

Federal regulations require milk that enters interstate commerce to be pasteurized.\n\n\"The pasteurization process has served public health well for more than 100 years,\" the FDA said. \"Even if [the] virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health.\"\n\n\"To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\nPasteurization is different from complete sterilization, which extends shelf life but is not required to ensure milk safety, the agency said.\n\nOfficials with the FDA and the USDA had previously said milk from affected cattle did not enter the commercial supply. Milk from sick animals is supposed to be diverted and destroyed.\n\nFDA officials did not indicate how many samples they tested or where they were obtained. The agency has been evaluating milk during processing and from grocery stores, officials said. Results of additional tests are expected in \"the next few days to weeks.\"\n\nThe PCR lab test the FDA used would have detected viral genetic material even after a live virus was killed by pasteurization or heat treatment, Lee-Ann Jaykus, an emeritus food microbiologist and virologist at North Carolina State University told the Associated Press.\n\nAVIAN INFLUENZA: SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE AND HOW IT AFFECTS BIRDS AND HUMANS\n\n\"There is no evidence to date that this is [an] infectious virus and the FDA is following up on that,\" Jaykus said.\n\nScientists confirmed the H5N1 virus in dairy cows in March after weeks of reports that cows in Texas were suffering from a mysterious malady.\n\nThe FDA says HPAI has now been confirmed in domestic livestock in 33 herds across eight states: Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, South Dakota, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, and North Carolina.\n\nWhile the virus is lethal to commercial poultry, most infected cattle seem to recover within two weeks, experts say.\n\nThe National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) echoed the FDA's assertions that pasteurization is effective against HPAI and that commercial milk supply is safe.\n\n\"Viral fragments detected after pasteurization are nothing more than evidence that the virus is dead; they have zero impact on human health,\" the NMPF said in a statement.\n\n\"Further, the federal PMO prohibits milk from sick cows from entering the food supply chain. Milk and milk products produced and processed in the United States are among the safest in the world.\"\n\nThe news comes after a goat in Minnesota tested positive HPAI in February, which marked the first U.S. case of bird flu in domestic cattle, sheep, goats or their relatives.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe positive juvenile goat was residing on a Stevens County farm that already had bird flu infected poultry, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.\n\nTo date, two people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu.

ISDA said it recommends farmers test groups of at-risk cattle \"whenever necessary,\" and testing asymptomatic cattle is voluntary.\n\nRick Naerebout, the CEO of the Idaho Dairymen's Association, previously said that it appeared the virus had been contained to the first Cassia County farm, as the eight sick cows there had recovered.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said this week it found nonviable viral evidence of the H5N1 bird flu in pasteurized milk, but stressed it believes milk is still safe to consume.\n\nScientists analyzing the USDA's genetic data also hypothesize that bird flu has been spreading among cows for longer than officials initially realized.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the virus had been detected in 33 dairy herds across eight states.\n\nThe USDA also announced additional mandatory requirements for testing dairy cattle being transported across state lines and for reporting influenza cases, effective next week.\n\nThe agency said it has not found changes in the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans or between people.", "source": {"uri": "boisestatepublicradio.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boise State Public Radio"}, "authors":

Experts see little risk", "body": "PARIS, April 25 -- The discovery of traces of the bird flu virus in pasteurised cow milk in the United States sparked questions over whether the disease could spread to humans, but experts say there is little risk from food contamination.\n\nUS authorities on Tuesday said that they had discovered traces of bird flu virus in the cow milk supply during the course of a large study, but the samples likely posed no health risk to humans.\n\nWhat do we know?\n\nAn outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has spread among dairy cattle herds throughout the United States and infected one human, who had mild symptoms, authorities said.\n\nThough the H5N1 strain of HPAI has killed millions of poultry during the current wave, affected cows have not fallen severely sick.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration said that during the course of a national survey, it had discovered viral particles in \"milk from affected animals, in the processing system, and on the shelves\".\n\nBut the samples were run through a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test, which is able to detect remnants of the pathogen's genetic material -- though the virus itself was inactivated by the heat of the pasteurisation process.\n\nHow did it happen?\n\nThe bird flu A/H5N1 strain first appeared in 1996 but since 2020 the number of contaminated bird populations has exploded, and a growing number of mammals have since been infected.\n\nIn March, both cows and goats joined the list, a surprise for experts because until now the animals had not been considered at risk of catching this type of virus.\n\n\"In the United States, a new H5N1 virus has intermingled with local viruses, and has the ability to multiply extremely rapidly in a cow's udder,\" said Jean-Claude Manuguerra, director of the environment and infection risks department at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.\n\nBut even though H5N1 has killed millions of poultry during the current wave, infected cows have not become seriously ill.\n\nPandemic risk?\n\nBased on studies to date, most experts say that even if the bird flu virus spreads to a human, the chances of widespread contamination are slim.\n\n\"Is the fact that virus traces have been found in cow milk worrying? No, although the fact that another animal is susceptible to contamination by this virus is not good news,\" said Bruno Lina, a virologist at the Lyon hospital in southeast France.\n\n\"There's a risk of random cases, in animals or humans. But we're not seeing any major mutation of the virus that would lead to a greater pandemic risk than three or four months ago,\" he said.\n\nHuman health threat?\n\nUS authorities said earlier in April that a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to cattle.\n\nThe symptoms were mild, with only an eye infection, after being in direct contact with a cow.\n\n\"What we know is that the virus can cause in humans an infection in two specific places: An eye infection -- which is mild -- or in the pulmonary alveoli, the deepest parts of the lung,\" Lina said.\n\nIn the latter case, the infection can prove serious -- of the roughly 900 cases of H5N1 documented in humans over the past 20 years by the World Health Organization, half have ended in death.\n\nBut when it comes to drinking pasteurised milk, the risks drop to nearly zero even if virus traces are found.\n\n\"Pasteurisation destroys the virus even if it doesn't eradicate every trace of its presence,\" Lina said.\n\nWhat about raw milk?\n\nSeveral countries such as France are fond of their raw chesses, but experts note that the sanitary conditions of their production are strictly controlled.\n\n\"Has anyone ever been exposed to non-pasteurised milk contaminated by H5N1, and developed an infection by the normal means of consumption, the mouth or digestive tract? It's never been demonstrated,\" Lina said.\n\nAnd for now, the latest virus strain discovered in the United States is different from those currently circulating in Europe, said Manuguerra.\n\nAnd no H5N1 infections have so far been found in French cows for example, he said.\n\n\"The warning has been sounded, there is extra vigilance -- and these viruses can mutate so rapidly that you have to keep an eye on them,\" he added.\n\n\"But I think that consumers should absolutely not be worried.\" -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [],

Traces of bird flu.\n\nThis announcement was made during a national trend The first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection among dairy cows was confirmed late last month. The disease, which is highly contagious and often fatal in birds, has spread to the following areas: a cluster of at least eight states. At least one person who probably came into contact with the sick animal also contracted the virus.\n\nBut government officials and scientific experts say so far there is no evidence that pasteurized milk contains infectious viruses.\n\nJeanne Marazzo, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a call with reporters Wednesday that tests conducted on retail milk showed the presence of genetic material from the virus.\n\nMarrazzo said attempts to grow the virus from these samples showed it was not infectious or \"alive,\" adding that testing was only done on a small number of samples.\n\n\"To date, we have not seen anything that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the FDA said in a statement.\n\nIf pasteurization inactivates viruses, why do they appear in milk?\n\npasteurized used in the US It takes decades to kill harmful bacteria and viruses in milk, but pasteurization does not erase all traces of viruses.\n\nSome genetic material may remain after the pasteurization process. Samuel Arcane, a professor of food science at Cornell University, said DNA, or RNA, is the \"instructions\" that tell the virus what to do.\n\n\"Cars get into accidents. The car doesn't work anymore. You can't drive it. You can't do anything the car does. But if you dig through the rubble, you'll find that the owner's manual that tells you how to drive the car is still there. 'You might find it,' he said.\n\nAlkain said this is likely what is happening with avian influenza in milk. Tests have shown that the virus was present before, but is now unable to cause infection.\n\nThe FDA said no specific studies have been conducted on whether pasteurization inactivates avian influenza in milk because the infection in cows is so new.

The FDA encourages consumers not to drink unpasteurized raw milk.\n\nBut Alcain said the flu is not generally transmitted through food, and the more pressing concern is protecting people, such as farm workers, who may come into close contact with infected animals. .\n\nIn an effort to further contain the outbreak, the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced: order Steps taken Wednesday include requiring dairy cows to test negative for bird flu before traveling across state lines.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Infant_and_Toddlers", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Infant and Toddlers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/04/24/gettyimages-1244715362_wide-dfbb2f6103887733c2a5837f34ba23c31481bd6f-s1400-c100.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Nevertheless, the agency notes that this milk remains safe for humans to drink as it has been heated to temperatures that are high enough for harmful bacteria and viruses to be eradicated.\n\nVilsack also says that the milk supply of the US that the milk supply remains safe based on currently available information. The secretary adds that there was no live virus that was detected.\n\nMilk that had particles of bird flu entered the supply from cows that were asymptomatic and that were found to be positive via testing. The USDA has also conducted over 2,000 tests on cow samples in the past several weeks.\n\nMoreover, in the past several weeks, the USDA has observed spreads across cows belonging to the same herds, among dairies linked to cattle movements, among cows to poultry, and cows that do not exhibit any clinical signs of positive infection.", "source": {"uri": "sciencetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Science Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kendra_stacy@sciencetimes.com", "name": "Kendra Stacy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Vilsack", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Vilsack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Watson,_Baron_Watson_of_Invergowrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children's_Research_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Arizona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://1721181113.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/53285/820/0/0/0/cattle.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

He had been struck by the huge amounts of H5N1 virus he'd seen in milk from cows infected with the bird flu and thought that at least some virus was getting off of farms and going downstream -- onto store shelves.\n\nHe knew the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was working on its own national survey of the milk supply. But he was impatient. So he and a graduate student went on a road trip: They collected 150 commercial milk products from around the Midwest, representing dairy processing plants in 10 different states, including some where herds have tested positive for H5N1. Genetic testing found viral RNA in 58 samples, he told STAT.\n\nThe researchers expect additional lab studies currently underway to show that those samples don't contain live virus with the capability to cause human infections, meaning that the risk of pasteurized milk to consumer health is still very low. But the prevalence of viral genetic material in the products they sampled suggest that the H5N1 outbreak is likely far more widespread in dairy cows than official counts indicate. So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 33 herds in eight states have tested positive for H5N1.\n\n\"The fact that you can go into a supermarket and 30 to 40% of those samples test positive, that suggests there's more of the virus around than is currently being recognized,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who has been analyzing the samples at St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Memphis where he heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals.\n\nEarlier this week, the FDA announced that its effort had found evidence of the H5N1 virus in samples of milk purchased from store shelves, but it provided no detailed results. The testing by PCR -- polymerase chain reaction -- turned up only genetic traces of the virus, not evidence that it's alive or infectious. The FDA has been adamant that H5N1, which is heat-sensitive, is very likely killed through the process of pasteurization.\n\nThe agency is still assessing those samples for viral viability by attempting to grow virus from milk found to contain RNA from H5N1. The FDA plans to release results of those studies in the coming days. On Wednesday, Jeanne Marrazzo, the new director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters that a team of NIAID-funded researchers had early data to suggest that pasteurization does appear to be effective.\n\nThe team that produced that data -- the St. Jude and OSU groups -- told STAT that it has so far analyzed four samples of store-bought milk which had tested positive via PCR for H5N1 genetic material. \"We've done the viral growth assays to see if we can recover any virus from them and we can't,\" Webby said.\n\nThose four samples came from an initial collection of 22 commercial milk products purchased in the Columbus, Ohio,, Ohio, area. \"It was basically just me hitting up the five grocery stores between campus and my house,\" said Bowman.\n\nPCR testing at OSU revealed 33 of those 22 products to be positive for viral RNA. Bowman sent them to Webby to inject into plates of mammalian cells and embryonated chicken eggs and look for any signs of active viral replication. In order to do that, Webby needed a negative control so he went and bought milk at a store near his lab in Memphis. But PCR testing found H5N1 RNA in that sample too, making it useless as a negative control, but an additional data point showing a lack of live virus.\n\nThat sample is still in Webby's fridge at home. He used it to make dinner earlier this week. \"I'm not concerned about it all,\" he said.\n\nThe St. Jude group is now repeating the experiment with the additional samples Bowman and his graduate student bought around the Midwest. Their early findings provide further evidence that H5N1 is spreading broadly among dairy cows in the US.\n\nThis week, researchers examining viral genome sequences released Sunday by the USDA found that the outbreak has likely been underway for months longer than previously known. \"Both of these data -- the milk data and the genetic data that shows this has been around since December of last year -- suggests that the outbreak is probably much bigger than we know,\" said Angie Rasmussen, a virologist who studies emerging zoonotic pathogens at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.\n\nIt may also signal that herds can be infectious with only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which would complicate the response and make containment much more difficult.\n\n\"This is telling us that we're probably already seeing that milk from asymptomatically infected cows does have some virus in there,\" said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist who studies respiratory viruses at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nSo far, there has been only one report of H5N1 infections in a cattle herd with no symptoms -- in North Carolina. But USDA officials have not disclosed further details beyond the fact that milk from infected but asymptomatic cows seems unchanged.\n\nIn H5N1-infected cows, the first thing that tends to happen is their appetite disappears and their activity goes down. Then their milk production dries up. In some animals, the milk they do produce turns yellow and thick. \"It's an odd thing that seems to be unique to this particular virus,\" said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Diagnostic Laboratory. And it's one of the chief red flags that dairy farmers are supposed to be on the lookout for when deciding whether to test their herds. If milk from asymptomatic or presymptomatic cows looks normal but can carry virus, it would obscure the need for testing.\n\nTo really understand the scale of spread as well as possible mechanisms of viral transmission, it's necessary to conduct widespread testing of animals with and without symptoms, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of Brown University's Pandemic Center. \"If we're only testing cows with outward symptoms, we're missing infections in those without.\"\n\nUp until this week, USDA policy did not require testing of any animals, and only recommended it for dairy cows greater than three years of age that have been lactating for at least 150 days and are showing severe clinical symptoms like fever, lethargy, abnormal milk production, and loose stool.\n\nOn Wednesday, the agency issued a federal order requiring an animal to test negative for the virus before it can be transported across state lines. It also requires laboratories and state veterinarians to report to the USDA any animals that have tested positive for H5N1 or any other influenza A virus. But outside of interstate travel, testing remains voluntary and encouraged only for visibly ill animals.\n\nPublic health experts told STAT that such narrow testing criteria are likely distorting the true extent of the outbreak. \"I have not seen evidence that makes me want to discard the fear that testing practices are absolutely shaping what we think we know about this virus,\" Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said in an interview. \"We just don't have the right data right now to tell us what's going on.\"\n\nThe situation is reminiscent, she said, of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the early weeks of that outbreak, testing policies were narrow -- limited to symptomatic individuals who had traveled to China. Meanwhile, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was spreading undetected throughout the U.S., as genomic analyses would later show. Later, when at-home tests became widely available, official counts became unreliable, leaving state and local health departments in the dark.\n\n\"At least with Covid, wastewater surveillance eventually kicked in to supplement our picture,\" Nuzzo said. \"With H5N1, we don't have that.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is exploring wastewater testing for H5N1, but noted significant hurdles, including farms not being linked to municipal wastewater systems and the potential for infected wild birds to confound testing of water around farms.\n\nRequiring dairy farms to regularly test all their animals, including asymptomatic ones, is not logistically feasible given the current capacity of state veterinary diagnostic laboratories, Paulsen said. He and other lab directors are already bracing for the massive ramp up in testing they expect to begin when the USDA order goes into effect Monday. But he does think more has to be done at the federal level to encourage farmers to test their herds.\n\n\"At this point, farms just aren't volunteering samples because they don't have any incentives to raise their hand,\" Paulsen said. That information blackout makes it much more challenging for epidemiologists to trace the virus and understand how it's spreading, the exact mechanisms of which are still unclear.\n\n\"We need to do what we can now to understand it and contain it so it doesn't turn into a pathogen of pandemic potential,\" Paulsen said. \"That is a real risk if we continue to ignore it.\"", "source": {"uri":

The FDA maintains that no risk is posed to consumers as the found material was inactivated.\n\nTo date, only two people in the U.S. have contracted bird flu, both in close contact with infected animals, one being a dairy worker in Texas, and the other a prison inmate in Colorado in 2022.

But the virus so far has not reached Pennsylvania and does not appear to present a danger to humans, agricultural experts say.\n\nThe closest identified cases of the virus in cattle are in Ohio. Still, Pennsylvania and federal authorities are taking measures to contain the outbreak. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania required that cattle from states with avian flu cases get tested before they enter the state. And the federal government on Thursday announced that dairy cattle must now test negative for the virus before they are allowed to move between states.\n\nExposure to the virus is unlikely in Philadelphia, said Ernest Hovingh, the director of Pennsylvania State University's Animal Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\n\"People are more likely to be exposed to a virus by wild birds flying over Philadelphia and potentially pooping on a picnic table,\" he said.\n\nEven then, cases are rare in humans, though they do occur, and in even more rare instances can cause severe illness and death, the CDC says.\n\nHere's a primer on highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, and the measures that Pennsylvania agricultural officials are taking to keep it out of the state.\n\nAvian flu is a virus that typically spreads through wild birds, especially waterfowl. Wild birds generally show no signs of the virus even when they're infected, but domestic birds can contract the virus through contact with wild birds or their droppings.\n\nHPAI is an aggressive form of the disease that's highly contagious, causes serious respiratory and digestive symptoms, like gasping for breath and diarrhea, in domestic birds, and can wipe out entire flocks. Usually, domestic flocks with HPAI are euthanized.\n\nAvian flu has turned up in other animal populations, including mammals, in the past, Hovingh said. \"It's not really that surprising that other species can be infected with this,\" he said.\n\nWhat's different about this outbreak is that herds are getting sick, not just individual animals. It's unclear what's caused the wider spread of the disease, Hovingh said.\n\nCattle are not as affected by avian flu as birds, Hovingh added. \"It's not a virus that really belongs in dairy cows,\" he said. Symptoms among dairy cattle include eating less, producing less milk, and, occasionally, diarrhea or very dry manure. Most cows will recover within two to three weeks, he said.\n\nPennsylvania has seen cases of avian flu in birds for the last two years; in March 2023, the state had more birds with HPAI than anywhere else in the country. That outbreak has subsided in recent months, Hovingh said, but agriculture officials are still on high alert.\n\nSo far, Pennsylvania has seen no cases of avian flu in cattle. The closest confirmed cases emerged in Ohio and North Carolina.\n\n\"With most of these [infected] herds, so far, we've had a way to track the animals and the disease back to Texas, Kansas, or New Mexico, where this was first seen,\" Hovingh said.\n\n\"It appears that this is coming to the other states from animals moving from the areas where it was first detected a couple months ago. That's important, because that helps us as a state try to decide what we're going to do.\"\n\nPennsylvania required that cattle from affected states be tested for avian flu as well before they enter the state prior to this week's federal directive requiring that cattle must test negative for HPAI before moving between states.\n\nThe state's quarantine order, released earlier this month, also says animals from infected herds cannot move to Pennsylvania until their farm has been found to be free of the disease.\n\nFarmers who believe their cows may be infected with avian flu should call the state Department of Agriculture, which has vets on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Hovingh said.\n\nPenn State Extension, the university's science education arm, is also on call 24/7 to examine flu tests from farms on an emergency basis, Hovingh said. \"If we suspect [an outbreak of avian flu], we're able to test for that very quickly,\" he said.\n\nThe CDC has identified one case of a person getting infected with bird flu after being exposed to dairy cattle, and the agency says that bird flu spreading from person to person is very rare.\n\nThe agency recommends avoiding contact with animal feces, raw milk, and litter, as well as anything contaminated by animals with suspected or confirmed avian flu. The CDC's experts monitoring the outbreak have also not noticed an unusual uptick in flu or flulike illnesses in humans.\n\nThe strain of avian flu infecting cattle has been found in raw milk, Hovingh said, although milk from animals who test positive for the virus is not being sold. On Tuesday, the federal Food and Drug Administration said it had found fragments of the virus in pasteurized milk, but had no reason to believe the national milk supply is unsafe.\n\nPasteurization, the process that heats milk to a high temperature to kill viruses and other pathogens, likely also kills this strain of avian flu, but may leave behind harmless particles of the virus, the FDA said in a statement.\n\nRaw milk can be purchased in Pennsylvania, and sellers usually subject that milk to tests for bacteria -- but not for HPAI, Hovingh said. \"There's probably virus getting into milk, but being killed by pasteurization -- which is what it's intended for,\" he said. \"Avoiding raw milk is generally a good idea.\"", "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

This is the key question for us,\" Donald Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.\n\nThe type of testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can detect the intact virus but can also detect residual genetic material from killed pathogens.\n\n\"There are not studies directly looking at avian influenza in bovine milk,\" Mr. Prater, a doctor of veterinary medicine, said Thursday.\n\nThe FDA initially said, after the bird flu crossed into cattle in March, that no commercially available milk would contain the virus because farmers were being directed to divert or destroy milk from sick cows, and because pasteurization would kill any remaining affected milk.\n\nThis week, the agency acknowledged uncertainty on the matter. \"Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe FDA has refused to say how many samples from grocery stores tested positive and the source or sources of the samples.\n\nMr. Prater and other officials shed no new light on that front. Mr. Prater merely said that the FDA collected retail samples of \"various milk and milk products\" and that the U.S. Department of Agriculture tested the samples.\n\nMr. Prater said the FDA, other government agencies, and outside researchers are engaged in studies to answer a number of critical questions, including whether intact virus survives pasteurization.\n\n\"PCR-positive levels aren't necessarily indicative of live virus so it's important to understand what we're seeing in retail milk,\" he said.\n\nSome pasteurization experiments involve taking milk samples and applying different time and temperature combinations. One example is looking at whether high-temperature-short-time pasteurization, or 161.6 degrees Fahrenheit heat for 15 seconds, will kill the virus.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health is examining the impact of giving raw milk from sick cattle to rodents, while several other agencies are working on epidemiological investigations into cases of the virus.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed cattle-to-cattle transmission of the virus just weeks after the first cases in cattle were confirmed in Texas and Kansas. Experts say that the virus does transmit through milk.\n\nIt's still unclear how long the virus remains viable and the level of virus that makes milk infectious, according to Mr. Prater. He described not knowing as \"two really important data gaps that we have.\"\n\nAuthorities are advising farms with confirmed bird flu infections to discard milk from the animals in some way. They can also feed the milk to other animals but only after heat treatment at levels similar to those used in pasteurization.\n\nTesting so far has confirmed cases of H5N1, a strain of the avian influenza, in 33 cattle herds across eight states. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials told the conference Thursday that it and state partners have actively monitored 44 people in contact with sick animals and tested at least 23 people who showed symptoms, but only one human in Texas has tested positive so far.\n\nThe action will \"help us get ahead of this disease and limit its spread,\" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.\n\nH5N1 originated in China among birds in the 1990s. The latest strain has been circulating in the United States since 2021. The virus infected numerous flocks of poultry before beginning to infect ruminants earlier this year.\n\nThere's no indication at present of transmission among humans and sequencing from the virus taken from the Texas patient showed no adaptations that would make the virus more transmissible to or among humans, CDC officials said Thursday. Analysis of the testing results suggests antivirals like Tamiflu used against influenza will work in human cases, Vivien Dugan, one of the officials, told the conference.\n\nIf more cases among humans appear and vaccines are cleared, then the vaccines would be expected to be at least as good as seasonal influenza shots, Ms. Dugan said. The seasonal shots often provide subpar protection against infection and better shielding against severe disease.\n\nFederal agencies are recommending people take steps such as not consuming raw milk, cheese, or meat from animals with suspected or confirmed H5N1 and avoiding exposure without protection to sick or dead animals or animal feces.\n\nFarmers and farm workers are being advised to carefully handle sick and dead animals. They should wear safety goggles and other equipment to prevent infection, according to the CDC. The agency said doctors should test people who might have H5N1 infections and, if tests return positive, pass on information to laboratories for further analysis.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Vilsack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Vilsack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/08/id5624245-fda-eet-10.13-LSedit-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 259, "textEnd": 267}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Usually, domestic flocks with HPAI are euthanized.\n\nAvian flu has turned up in other animal populations, including mammals, in the past, Hovingh said. \"It's not really that surprising that other species can be infected with this,\" he said.\n\nWhat's different about this outbreak is that herds are getting sick, not just individual animals. It's unclear what's caused the wider spread of the disease, Hovingh said.\n\nCattle are not as affected by avian flu as birds, Hovingh added. \"It's not a virus that really belongs in dairy cows,\" he said. Symptoms among dairy cattle include eating less, producing less milk, and, occasionally, diarrhea or very dry manure. Most cows will recover within two to three weeks, he said.\n\nPennsylvania has seen cases of avian flu in birds for the last two years; in March 2023, the state had more birds with HPAI than anywhere else in the country. That outbreak has subsided in recent months, Hovingh said, but agriculture officials are still on high alert.\n\nSo far, Pennsylvania has seen no cases of avian flu in cattle. The closest confirmed cases emerged in Ohio and North Carolina.\n\n\"With most of these [infected] herds, so far, we've had a way to track the animals and the disease back to Texas, Kansas, or New Mexico, where this was first seen,\" Hovingh said.\n\n\"It appears that this is coming to the other states from animals moving from the areas where it was first detected a couple months ago. That's important, because that helps us as a state try to decide what we're going to do.\"\n\nPennsylvania required that cattle from affected states be tested for avian flu as well before they enter the state before this week's federal directive requiring that cattle must test negative for HPAI before moving between states.\n\nThe state's quarantine order, released earlier this month, also says animals from infected herds cannot move to Pennsylvania until their farm has been found to be free of the disease.\n\nFarmers who believe their cows may be infected with avian flu should call the state Department of Agriculture, which has vets on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Hovingh said.\n\nPenn State Extension, the university's science education arm, is also on-call 24/7 to examine flu tests from farms on an emergency basis, Hovingh said. \"If we suspect [an outbreak of avian flu], we're able to test for that very quickly,\" he said.\n\nThe CDC has identified one case of a person getting infected with bird flu after being exposed to dairy cattle, and the agency says that bird flu spreading from person to person is very rare.\n\nThe agency recommends avoiding contact with animal feces, raw milk, and litter, as well as anything contaminated by animals with suspected or confirmed avian flu. The CDC's experts monitoring the outbreak have also not noticed an unusual uptick in flu or flulike illnesses in humans.\n\nThe strain of avian flu infecting cattle has been found in raw milk, Hovingh said, although milk from animals who test positive for the virus is not being sold. On Tuesday, the federal Food and Drug Administration said it had found fragments of the virus in pasteurized milk, but had no reason to believe the national milk supply is unsafe.\n\nPasteurization, the process that heats milk to a high temperature to kill viruses and other pathogens, likely also kills this strain of avian flu, but may leave behind harmless particles of the virus, the FDA said in a statement.\n\nRaw milk can be purchased in Pennsylvania, and sellers usually subject that milk to tests for bacteria -- but not for HPAI, Hovingh said. \"There's probably virus getting into milk, but being killed by pasteurization -- which is what it's intended for,\" he said. \"Avoiding raw milk is generally a good idea.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Here's What That Means", "body": "Fragments of the virus that causes bird flu, H5N1, has been found in samples of pasteurized milk, according to a Tuesday update from the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSince bird flu was first reported in dairy cows herds earlier this spring, health agencies have only previously reported detecting the virus in samples of raw or unpasteurized milk, which hasn't gone through the process of heating milk to get rid of viruses and bacteria like pasteurized products have.\n\nStill, the agency stressed the commercial milk supply is still safe. Pasteurization is expected to inactivate bird flu virus and make it non-infectious -- even if parts of its genetic material are now showing up in some milk samples -- and it's a requirement for milk entering the commercial milk supply, making up the vast majority of milk found on store shelves (though not all, depending on local laws).\n\n\"Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles,\" the FDA said.\n\n\"Therefore, some of the samples collected have indicated the presence of HPAI using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing,\" the agency said in the update, referring to bird flu's official term, highly pathogenic avian influenza, and a type of test that can detect evidence of a virus that isn't active or infectious.\n\nWhile the current public health threat to people remains low, some scientists and infectious disease experts have expressed concerns about US health agencies' response to bird flu in farm animals and their lack of details on the information pertaining to milk samples. Virologist Angela Rasmussen, for example, said in an X thread Tuesday that the new milk findings suggest the disease may be spreading asymptomatically in cows and more broadly than previously thought and that an \"apparent lack of transparency and urgency\" to share relevant data may be harming the ability to respond.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture on Wednesday issued a federal order requiring testing of cows as they move across state lines, in hopes of curbing the spread of bird flu. The New York Times reported that the USDA doesn't require farms to test cattle for infection. Normally, milk from sick cows (whatever their illness) and milk that looks off is separated from the rest of the supply.\n\nAnd what about the noncommercial milk supply, or raw milk that hasn't been pasteurized? While people who grew up on farms or around cattle might have had unpasteurized milk for dinner, raw milk has found a growing audience: people seeking it out for wellness purposes or sometimes traveling to local farms to consume a food they feel is more natural or holistic.\n\nAbout raw milk or dairy products during these bird-flu times, citing limited information on bird flu in dairy, the FDA says it doesn't know whether bird flu viruses can be transmitted through unpasteurized products. The agency is reiterating its general stance that people should avoid consuming raw or unpasteurized milk for risks of consuming pathogens that are particularly dangerous to children, older people, people who are pregnant and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe experts I spoke with for this story before it was first published earlier this month essentially said, in general, influenza isn't spread to people through eating or drinking. However, they stressed the existing health risks of unpasteurized milk, consumption and sales of which often fall outside what you'd typically see on grocery store shelves, dependent on local laws.\n\n\"In my opinion, there's a concern with raw milk acquisitions which can become part of the food system, and people secure that milk outside of going to the grocery store,\" Meg Schaeffer, an infectious disease epidemiologist and National Public Health adviser at the analytics firm SAS, told CNET when this article was first published.\n\nHere's what to know about unpasteurized milk, why people drink it and how we should be thinking about it in the context of bird flu in dairy cows.\n\nPasteurization is a heating process invented in the 1860s by French chemist Louis Pasteur and has been used widely since as a means to kill harmful bacteria and pathogens that can sometimes cause serious illness. These include bacteria that cause illness like E. coli, Listeria and Salmonella, and other pathogens.\n\nPasteurization is also expected to kill or inactivate the virus that causes bird flu, which is why health officials continue to say there's no risk to pasteurized dairy products or the commercial milk supply.\n\nSome dairy products may be ultrapasteurized, which is when milk is heated more quickly than typical pasteurization (a couple of seconds) at a higher temperature and then rapidly cooled down. This extends its shelf life.\n\nPasteurized dairy products can be organic or nonorganic. Whether you can buy or sell raw, unpasteurized milk depends on the laws in your state. In California, for example, you can buy raw milk from stores, although it has to be properly labeled with a warning stating it's unpasteurized.\n\nJenna Guthmiller, an immunologist, influenza researcher and assistant professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the University of Colorado, told CNET for the article's first publish that if someone were to drink milk contaminated with H5N1, it doesn't necessarily mean they would be infected. Influenza viruses are unstable outside the body, she explained, and milk \"bypasses the normal process by which we get infected\" with flu.\n\nFollowing up after health officials' latest announcement this week, Guthmiller added that bird flu outbreaks on dairy farms \"seem to be linked to each other, in that the viruses are very closely related.\"\n\n\"At the moment, this outbreak seems to be isolated to these very large dairy farms,\" Guthmiller said, noting that she wasn't aware of these larger farms selling raw milk.\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said in an email this week that finding bird flu virus material in pasteurized milk doesn't change the public health risk assessment.\n\n\"Pasteurization is a process that would destroy the viability of pathogens -- it's not a process that eliminates their genetic material,\" he said.\n\nAdalja previously noted it's \"unclear\" whether there would be a live virus in unpasteurized milk or if it could infect humans by their drinking it, he explained. Influenza viruses aren't spread to humans via ingestion. But on raw milk, he added, \"there are many reasons not to drink it to begin with.\"\n\nProponents of raw or unpasteurized milk prefer it for different reasons, including its creamier texture and taste or anecdotal reports that it's easier on digestion or more nutritious.\n\nYou can't argue with someone's taste or texture preferences when it comes to food. In terms of the nutritional or health benefits of raw milk compared with unpasteurized milk, research seems to have pushed back on or debunked the majority of claims. The FDA, for example, says that raw milk isn't a cure or antidote for lactose intolerance. The agency also claims on the same information page that people are misusing the results of a study from 2007 that was on farm milk consumption, not raw milk consumption.\n\nIn an analysis of the risks versus benefits of raw milk research, Healthline reported that any small antimicrobial benefit from raw milk would be neutralized when it's refrigerated. It also reported, based on the results of a systematic review, that minor nutrient losses of water-soluble vitamins, including some B vitamins, are already low in milk generally.\n\n\"Multiple studies have shown that pasteurization does not significantly affect the nutritional quality of milk,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes. \"Scientists do not have any evidence that shows a nutritional benefit from drinking raw milk.\"\n\nAs someone who grew up on a dairy farm, Guthmiller used to drink unpasteurized milk herself -- she gets it. When it comes to consuming raw milk, she said, \"the risks certainly outweigh the pros.\"\n\n\"We're getting to a point with pasteurization where it looks like real milk,\" Guthmiller said. In terms of nutritional quality, \"you really do not affect the contents of the milk\" by pasteurizing it, she said, because it's done so quickly.\n\nIf you're looking for foods with proven gut-health properties, look at adding foods like kimchi, pickled vegetables, sourdough, apple cider vinegar and buttermilk.\n\nIn addition to what Guthmiller called \"old timey\" bacteria that used to be a problem back in the day, before processes like pasteurization cleaned up the food supply, unpasteurized or raw milk can expose people to serious illnesses like E. coli and listeria. While it may cause only temporary or milder illness in most people, people with weakened immune systems, older adults, those who are pregnant and very young children are especially at risk of serious health effects from drinking unpasteurized milk.\n\nThe risk is especially high in children, according to Schaeffer, who are especially vulnerable to severe illness In serious cases, health effects from drinking raw milk that's been contaminated can lead to kidney failure.\n\nSchaeffer also pushed back on claims that diseases that once were a big problem in countries like the US, like tuberculosis, are no longer an issue. That's true about tuberculosis, she said, but we also have effective treatment for it. That's not the case, she said, for some types of illness that children can get from unpasteurized milk.\n\n\"The diseases, if anything, are even stronger -- antibiotic resistant,\" Schaeffer said. She added that some bacteria that may be in raw milk may go undetected by farmers because they don't cause illness in cows but do in people.\n\nWhile buying raw milk from a farm you know sets higher safety standards and practices \"good hygiene\" during milking can reduce the risk of contaminated raw milk, it won't eliminate it, according to the CDC.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louis Pasteur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/8cc3975a79e6606f58af3c2691ab6d60e27ee02d/hub/2024/04/04/aee59770-1898-4f07-8f7a-8c6d7f41bb0e/gettyimages-1214776551.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Shortly after, the virus was also detected in an Idaho dairy herd.\n\nSince then, eight states have confirmed detections of the virus in livestock, which is now being referred to as BIAV (bovine influenza A virus) in cattle. The concerns over the spread of HPAI through cattle resulted in tightening restrictions on cattle imports between states.\n\nNew FDA statement confirms virus found in pasteurized milk\n\nWhile the presence of the virus had been detected in raw milk of affected cattle, this week's FDA update has confirmed that virus particles have been found in pasteurized milk. The FDA affirms the virus would be rendered inert by the pasteurization process.\n\nThe official statement adds:\n\n... the FDA is further assessing any positive findings through egg inoculation tests, a gold-standard for determining viable virus. To date, we have seen nothing that would change our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe. Results from multiple studies will be made available in the next few days to weeks.\n\nPasteurization has been found to cause thermal inactivation of HPAI in eggs; the process is done at a lower temperature for eggs than for milk.\n\nThe FDA also has stated that milk from sick animals is being diverted or destroyed. Dr. Eric Topol of the Scripps Research Translational Institute told CNN that this FDA update indicates the outbreak may be worse than previously understood, stating, \"The dissemination to cows is far greater than we have been led to believe.\"\n\nCNN also notes that cats have been found dead at affected dairy barns, possibly from ingesting infected milk.\n\nCommercial milk is still indicated to be safe\n\nDespite these new findings, the FDA and USDA continue to assert that the milk supply available to the general public on shelves is safe to use and drink.\n\nThe organization continues to provide a webpage with detailed information on the safety of dairy products.\n\nThere is a large amount of ongoing research into how the virus affects dairy products, alongside the virus's transmissibility. Because this situation is new, scientists are at the forefront of discovering the effects on the public, on animals, and on the agricultural industry.\n\nFDA issues mandatory livestock testing and reporting\n\nThe FDA today issued a new ruling that mandates testing of livestock for HPAI/BIAV.

But the results suggest that the virus has spread further across dairy farms than previously indicated.\n\nResearchers discovered H5N1 in store-bought milk using highly sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing, which looks for traces of genetic material belonging to a target germ. Importantly, these tests cannot be used to confirm the presence of live, infectious virus. The FDA's early assessment is that these tests have only identified inert remnants of H5N1 in the milk. But the agency is now preparing to perform additional \"gold standard\" tests to know for sure. At the same time, health officials continue to believe that commercial milk is unlikely to help spread H5N1 to humans.\n\n\"The FDA and USDA have indicated that based on the information currently available, our commercial milk supply is safe because of these two reasons: 1) the pasteurization process and 2) the diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows,\" the agency said Tuesday in its latest update on the situation.\n\nTo date, cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 in cows have been found in at least 30 farms across eight states. These strains are called highly pathogenic due to the massive illness and deaths that they can cause among wild and domestic birds. So far, infected cows have generally avoided severe illness, but many have experienced symptoms such as reduced or discolored milk production and low appetite.\n\nGenetic evidence released to the outside science community on Sunday suggests that the initial spillover event from birds to cows may have occurred as early as December 2023, months before the first known cases were reported by local officials. And, coupled with the discovery of H5N1 in store-bought milk, it's now looking likely that outbreaks are much more widespread than currently tallied.\n\n\"The dissemination to cows is far greater than we have been led to believe,\" Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe major worry with avian influenza strains such as H5N1 is that they could someday develop the right assortment of mutations that would allow the virus to spread easily between humans while also causing severe illness in many. So, the longer it's able to remain in cows, the greater the likelihood that some strains will adapt and become better at transmitting between mammals, humans included.\n\nWhile our milk supply may be safe and the overall risk to humans remains low for now, these latest developments indicate that stopping H5N1 in its tracks before things can grow worse is not going to be easy.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appetite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/f305ed2f2d008866cfaa4bb2d44ecaeb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The new rules will take effect on April 29.\n\nThe move comes after multiple dairy herds in eight U.S. states have tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Some herds tested positive after they acquired cows from affected herds in other states. USDA has identified spread between cows within the same herd, spread from cows to poultry, spread between dairies associated with cattle movements, and cows without clinical signs that have tested positive. USDA said the new actions will \"help us get ahead of this disease and limit its spread.\"\n\nThe following measures will be required:\n\nMandatory testing for interstate movement of dairy cattle\n\nMandatory reporting\n\nOn April 16, APHIS microbiologists identified a shift in an H5N1 sample from a cow in Kansas that could indicate that the virus has an adaptation to mammals. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted further analysis of the specimen sequence, which did not change its overall risk assessment for the general public, because the substitution has been seen previously in other mammalian infections and does not impact viral transmission. Additionally, APHIS' National Veterinary Services Laboratories found H5N1 in a lung tissue sample from an asymptomatic cull dairy cow that originated from an affected herd and did not enter the food supply.\n\nUSDA said the novel movement of H5N1 between wild birds and dairy cows requires further testing and time to develop a critical understanding to support any future courses of action. This federal order is critical to increasing the information available for USDA. Requiring positive test reporting will help USDA better under this disease and testing before interstate movement will limit its spread.\n\n\"While we are taking this action today, it is important to remember that thus far, we have not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans and between people. While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, our partners at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believe that the current risk to the public remains low,\" USDA said on its website. \"Additionally, we continue to see affected cows recover after supported care with little to no associated mortality. We also continue to work with our partners in the states and industry to emphasize the critical importance biosecurity plays in limiting disease spread for all livestock and poultry.\"\n\nIn an update this week, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said tests have indicated the presence of avian influenza (AI) virus in pasteurized milk, but says it believes pasteurized milk is safe for human consumption and will conduct further testing. Pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, FDA said, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles. Therefore, some of the samples collected have indicated the presence of AI using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing.", "source": {"uri": "wattagnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WATTAgNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://img.wattagnet.com/files/base/wattglobalmedia/all/image/2024/04/holstein_dairy_cow_on_truck.662a583dad241.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 364, "textEnd": 372}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 469, "textEnd": 477}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 1111, "textEnd": 1119}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The outbreaks were likely caused by the presence of bacteria in the raw milk, including Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campylobacter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salmonella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosporidium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptosporidium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Listeria monocytogenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/WE2IYMYBOJDHZF4KWGH2HYILEI.jpg?auth=25a9ad52e3d6b7a55b37207d9c8c520daed5fa32981f23d81300e1772e42cbd7&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 327, "textEnd": 335}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Vilsack says there have been incidents where interstate movement has resulted in the spread of the virus. \"We're now seeing cow-to-cow and we're also seeing cow-to-poultry facilities,\" he says. \"We just need to constrain movement of potentially infected cattle across state lines.\"\n\nThe second part of the order will require mandatory reporting of all positive test results in livestock to USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nVilsack told reporters during a call on Wednesday that an APHIS microbiologist did identify a shift in an H5N1 sample from a cow in Kansas that could indicate that the virus has an adaptation to mammals. \"CDC conducted further analysis of that specimen sequence, and their assessment is and remains a low risk overall,\" he says.\n\nTraces of the virus have also been detected in the commercial milk supply. Vilsack says milk remains safe to drink. \"You can find particles of the virus after pasteurization,\" he says. \"Because pasteurization is not sterilization, it doesn't necessarily remove every evidence of a virus, but it what it does is it kills the capacity of the virus to be infectious.\"\n\nThe FDA is doing more extensive nationwide testing, and those results are expected soon.\n\nThe National Milk Producers Federation says the USDA's announcement and actions emphasize the continued concern and focus on the well-being of the animals and those who care for them. NMPF says the presence of the virus in dairy herds, along with dairy farmers' commitment to animal and human health, makes the USDA's actions on testing and interstate travel appropriate.\n\nThe virus was first detected in dairy cows in March and has been found in more than 30 herds in 8 states.\n\nThe Federal Order goes into effect on Monday, April 29, 2024.

Is it safe to drink? Here's what to know", "body": "Less than one month after a dairy worker in Texas tested positive for avian influenza, aka bird flu, federal officials have detected fragments of the bird flu virus in samples of pasteurized milk.\n\nHowever, the inactive viral particles do not pose a threat to consumers and the country's milk supply remains safe, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement on April 24.\n\nSince March, the United States has been facing an unusual outbreak of bird flu among dairy cattle. It's the first time this strain of the virus -- referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) -- has been detected in cows and the first instance of cow-to-human transmission of bird flu, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe person in Texas is only the second case of bird flu in a human in the U.S. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of this H5N1 virus so far, health officials are on high alert.\n\nIn a recent press conference, a top expert at the World Health Organization called the risk of the bird flu spreading to humans, \"an enormous concern.\" Speaking to reporters on April 18, WHO chief scientist Dr. Jeremy Farrar warned that bird flu viruses are increasingly infecting mammals.\n\n\"The great concern ... is that the virus evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission,\" said Farrar.\n\nIs bird flu a problem now?\n\nThe current bird flu outbreak has spread to over 30 dairy herds across the country. Although the risk to humans is considered low, health officials are calling for increased monitoring of infected animals and people exposed to them.\n\nWhile the thought of \"bird flu\" may sound alarming and stoke COVID-19 pandemic fears, influenza among birds is not new.\n\n\"The current bird flu strain that we're concerned with, H5N1, has actually been circulating around the world for quite some time,\" Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, tells TODAY.com.\n\nH5N1 is widespread among wild birds and is causing an ongoing outbreak among poultry in the U.S., per the CDC.\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nBird flu is a disease caused by infection with avian influenza type A viruses. Avian influenza A viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, such as geese, ducks and swans, says Schaffner, but they can also circulate among domestic poultry.\n\n\"Bird flu viruses occasionally get into other mammalian species (like pigs). We've all heard of swine flu,\" Schaffner says. Avian influenza A viruses can also infect horses, bats and dogs, per the CDC -- rarely, they spread to humans.\n\n\"More recently, we have seen an increase of infections in cattle,\" Dr. Hilary M. Babcock, infectious disease specialist at Washington University of St. Louis and BJC Healthcare, tells TODAY.com.\n\nThis is the first time the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, which causes severe and often fatal disease in birds, has been found in cows. \"That's pretty unusual,\" says Schaffner. However, this H5N1 strain does not seem to be making cows very sick, he adds.\n\nWhat states have bird flu?\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (which include the strain of H5N1 that's currently spreading) have been detected in the U.S. in wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks beginning in January 2022, according to the CDC.\n\nOverall, 48 states have reported cases of highly pathogenic H5N1.\n\nThe current outbreak of H5N1 affecting cows has spread to eight states so far, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of April 22, cases have been reported among dairy herds in:\n\nCurrently, only one human in Texas is known to have contracted H5N1 in this outbreak, the experts say.\n\nThere have been only two human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. ever, says Babcock -- the first case was detected in Colorado in 2022 in a person who had direct contact with infected poultry.\n\nAs H5N1 surveillance increases, experts anticipate the number of cases among cows to increase. \"We're looking harder now and finding more cases (among cattle) that even 10 years ago would have gone undetected,\" says Schaffner.\n\nThe risk to the general public in the U.S. is low, the experts say. For people exposed due to their line of work, the risk is considered \"low-to-moderate,\" the WHO said in a statement.\n\nHow does the bird flu spread to humans?\n\n\"Every once in a while, a bird flu virus can get into a human, but that's rare,\" says Schaffner. Avian influenza viruses can spread from infected birds to humans in a few ways, according to the CDC:\n\nInfected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, mucus and feces. People can become infected when a large enough amount of the virus gets into the mouth, nose, eyes or is inhaled, says Schaffner.\n\nTransmission to humans typically occurs through close contact with infected birds without protective gear. It can also occur if a person touches contaminated surfaces and puts their hands in their eyes or mouth or if they breathe in droplets from the air, per the CDC.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how the dairy cow infected the person in Texas, the experts note. The only other person who contracted H5N1 in the U.S. was directly involved in the culling of birds presumed to be infected with H5N1, says Babcock.\n\nSporadic cases of H5N1 in humans have been reported around the world, often in rural areas where people live closely with poultry or other birds. According to the WHO, since 2003 there have been 889 cases and 463 deaths caused by H5N1 in 23 countries.\n\nOnce the bird flu gets into a human, \"it is almost never spread to anyone else,\" says Schaffner. However, \"there are ultra-rare instances of transmission from a person very sick with bird flu to a family member or caregiver.\"\n\nNo human-to-human spread has occurred with the contemporary H5N1 viruses currently spreading in birds, the CDC said.\n\nWhen this does happen, it does not lead to continued spread between people \"because the virus doesn't have the (genetic) capacity to spread easily from person to person,\" says Schaffner.\n\n\"This strain of bird flu has been around for about a decade and it still has not picked up this capacity to spread readily from person to person, thankfully. ... That should be a matter of reassurance, but also keep us in public health on alert,\" says Schaffner.\n\nCan you get bird flu from drinking milk?\n\nThere is no evidence that people can get bird flu from food that's been properly prepared and cooked, and it is safe to drink pasteurized milk, the experts say.\n\n\"We have not seen cases that have been from ingesting animal products or animals that may have been infected,\" says Babcock.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA stressed that the commercial milk supply in the U.S. remains safe, but that studies on H5N1 are ongoing. The agency said it does not currently have concerns about the safety of pasteurized milk products, including pasteurized cheese.\n\nThe infected dairy cow herds that have been detected are in quarantine and their milk is being destroyed, says Schaffner.\n\n\"The pasteurization process in the U.S. keeps our milk supply very safe,\" says Babcock. Pasteurization heats the milk to a high enough temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, including influenza.\n\n\"Based on available information, pasteurization is likely to inactivate the virus, however the process is not expected to remove the presence of viral particles,\" the FDA said. The dead virus particles in milk do not represent the actual H5N1 virus, and are unlikely to make a person sick.\n\n\"If you tested most milk, you'd find E. coli and listeria and other things in it, too, but they'd all be dead. Pasteurization doesn't take them out, it just kills them,\" Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told NBC News.\n\nDrinking unpasteurized or \"raw\" milk, which is increasingly trendy, is associated with various infectious disease hazards, says Schaffner. \"I discourage people from drinking raw milk,\" he adds. The FDA\n\nCan you get bird flu from eating eggs?\n\nThe risk of humans becoming infected by eating eggs from poultry with H5N1 is low, says the FDA, and there are safeguards in place to identify infected poultry and remove their eggs from the market.\n\nIt's possible for products from infected animals to end up in the food supply, says Babcock, but the risk to humans is still very low. Properly storing and cooking food further reduces that risk.\n\nAlthough beef cattle are not involved in this outbreak, Schaffner recommends cooking beef to a safe internal temperature. The FDA recommends cooking eggs until the white and yolk are firm.\n\n\"There are other reasons that you shouldn't eat raw eggs (or meat), because these can carry lots of different pathogens,\" says Babcock.\n\nWhat happens if a human gets the bird flu?\n\nBird flu infections in humans can range in severity, the experts note. Some people have zero or only mild symptoms, while others develop severe disease, according to the CDC. \"It can be a serious infection with a high mortality rate,\" says Schaffner.\n\nThe Texas patient had a mild infection, with eye redness as the only symptom, the CDC said. \"It was not even a respiratory infection. It was ... conjunctivitis or pink eye,\" Schaffner notes.\n\nThe patient was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. \"We have antiviral medications, the same ones we use to treat regular flu, that work against this avian influenza strain,\" Schaffner says.\n\nThe other human case of H5N1 in the U.S. in 2022 was a mild infection as well, Babcock adds.\n\nSymptoms of bird flu in humans\n\nAccording to the CDC and experts, the reported signs and symptoms of avian influenza in humans include:\n\nBird flu in humans may look similar to a regular flu or upper respiratory infection, says Babcock, or a person may have no obvious symptoms. It can also lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure and other complications. \"There's a full range,\" she adds.\n\nThere is no way to diagnose an infection with bird flu by symptoms alone, the CDC says. Laboratory testing is required.\n\nCan you recover from bird flu?\n\nYes, you can recover from bird flu. The human recently infected in Texas was treated with flu antivirals and is recovering. The Colorado patient infected in 2022 also recovered.\n\nGlobally, bird flu symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, resulting in death in some cases, according to the CDC.\n\nHow to prevent spread of bird flu\n\nAlthough the risk of getting bird flu is low, the CDC recommends the following protective actions:", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

Officials say these samples do not appear to contain live virus and that the commercial milk supply should still be safe. But the results suggest that the virus has spread further across dairy farms than previously indicated.\n\nResearchers discovered H5N1 in store-bought milk using highly sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing, which looks for traces of genetic material belonging to a target germ. Importantly, these tests cannot be used to confirm the presence of live, infectious virus. The FDA's early assessment is that these tests have only identified inert remnants of H5N1 in the milk. But the agency is now preparing to perform additional \"gold standard\" tests to know for sure. At the same time, health officials continue to believe that commercial milk is unlikely to help spread H5N1 to humans.\n\n\"The FDA and USDA have indicated that based on the information currently available, our commercial milk supply is safe because of these two reasons: 1) the pasteurization process and 2) the diversion or destruction of milk from sick cows,\" the agency said Tuesday in its latest update on the situation.\n\nTo date, cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 in cows have been found in at least 30 farms across eight states. These strains are called highly pathogenic due to the massive illness and deaths that they can cause among wild and domestic birds. So far, infected cows have generally avoided severe illness, but many have experienced symptoms such as reduced or discolored milk production and low appetite. There have also been cases of H5N1 found in cats tied to these farm outbreaks, along with at least one human case, though no deaths in either species have been reported.\n\nGenetic evidence released to the outside science community on Sunday suggests that the initial spillover event from birds to cows may have occurred as early as December 2023, months before the first known cases were reported by local officials. And, coupled with the discovery of H5N1 in store-bought milk, it's now looking likely that outbreaks are much more widespread than currently tallied.\n\n\"The dissemination to cows is far greater than we have been led to believe,\" Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe major worry with avian influenza strains such as H5N1 is that they could someday develop the right assortment of mutations that would allow the virus to spread easily between humans while also causing severe illness in many. So, the longer it's able to remain in cows, the greater the likelihood that some strains will adapt and become better at transmitting between mammals, humans included.\n\nWhile our milk supply may be safe and the overall risk to humans remains low for now, these latest developments indicate that stopping H5N1 in its tracks before things can grow worse is not going to be easy.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_cara@qz.com", "name": "Ed Cara", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appetite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/f305ed2f2d008866cfaa4bb2d44ecaeb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Sign up for it here.\n\nFor the past couple of years, scientists have watched with growing concern as a massive outbreak of avian flu, also known as H5N1 bird flu, has swept through bird populations. Recently in the U.S., a farm worker and some cattle herds have been infected. I spoke with my colleague Katherine J. Wu, who covered the virus's spread in North America, about the risk of human infection and how, for animals, this has already been \"a pandemic many times over.\"\n\nKatherine J. Wu: When we're considering the toll on nonhuman animals, this is the largest, most deadly H5N1 outbreak that has been recorded in North America. It has been unfolding slowly for about two and a half years now, but it's become a gargantuan wave at this point.\n\nLora: Wow -- how alarmed are you by that?\n\nKatherine: I'm medium concerned -- and I have been medium concerned for a couple of years now. It's difficult to gauge the amount of alarm to feel, because it's so unprecedented. Still, most H5N1 outbreaks in the past have totally fizzled without much consequence, especially in this part of the world.\n\nI am worried because so many species have been getting sick. A huge number of wild birds have been infected, including species that haven't been affected in the past. And we've seen these massive outbreaks in domesticated chickens, which are packed together in farms.\n\nAvian flu is known to be a bird problem. Beyond that, we've been seeing these outbreaks in mammals for a couple of years now, which is more concerning because, of course, we are also mammals. Humans seem to be potentially susceptible to infection, but at the same time, it would take quite a lot for this to become another big human-flu pandemic.\n\nLora: Should we be concerned about getting sick?\n\nKatherine: People should be vigilant and paying attention to the news. But right now, as you and I are talking, there is still not a huge risk to people. You don't get a pandemic unless you have a pathogen that spreads very, very easily among people, and there's no evidence so far that this virus has mutated to that point.\n\nThere have been some human cases globally so far, but it's a very small number. They seem to have been cases where someone was highly exposed to the virus in domesticated animals. People got sick, but they didn't pass it to someone else.\n\nI'm definitely not saying that person-to-person transmission can't happen eventually, but there's a pretty big chasm between someone getting infected and someone being able to efficiently pass the virus on. It is concerning that we continue to see more mammal species affected by H5N1, including species that have a lot of close contact with humans. But this is not a five-alarm fire so far.\n\nLora: How will people's lives be affected?\n\nKatherine: The virus has already affected our lives. Egg prices went completely bonkers in 2022 and early 2023, and over the course of this outbreak, more than 90 million domestic poultry have died. It's not that all of those birds got sick -- when this virus breaks out on chicken farms, it's generally considered good practice to cull the chickens to halt the spread. Still, when you have that many chickens dying, egg prices are going to go up.\n\nWe're probably not on track to see that with cows anytime soon. Even though this virus has now been detected in dairy cows, they aren't getting wildly sick, and transmission doesn't seem as efficient. I don't think we're going to be in a situation where we're killing all of our dairy cows and no one can get milk.\n\nLora: The FDA announced yesterday that genetic evidence of this bird-flu virus had been found in samples of pasteurized milk. Is it still safe to drink milk?\n\nKatherine: So far, the answer is: generally, yes, if it's been pasteurized. Pasteurization is a process by which milk is treated with heat so that it will kill a whole bunch of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, and H5N1 is thought to be vulnerable to this. Also, researchers have been working to test cows so they can figure out which ones are sick. Only milk from healthy cows is authorized to enter the general food supply, though the trick will be finding all the cows that are actually infected. For now, the main ways that this virus will affect us will be indirect.\n\nLora: Is there anything that can be done to curb the spread among wild animals?\n\nKatherine: For the animal world, this has already been a \"pandemic\" many times over. It has been truly devastating in that respect. So many wild birds, sea lions, seals, and other creatures have died, and it's difficult to see how people can effectively intervene out in nature. There have been very few cases in which endangered animals have received vaccines because there's a real possibility that their populations could be 100 percent wiped out by this virus.\n\nFor most other animals in the wild, there's not a lot that can be done, except for people to pay attention to where the virus is spreading. The hope is that most animal populations will be resilient enough to get through this and develop some form of immunity.\n\nLora: Responses to COVID became very politicized. How might the aftermath of those mitigation measures shape how people respond to this virus, especially if it becomes a greater threat to humans?\n\nKatherine: We're so fresh off the worst days of COVID that if people were asked to buckle down or get a new vaccine, I suspect that a lot of them would be like, Not again. There is still a lot of mitigation fatigue, and many people are sick of thinking about respiratory viruses and taking measures to prevent outbreaks. And, certainly, people have lost a lot of trust in public health over the past four years.\n\nThat said, H5N1 is still a flu, and people are familiar with that type of virus. We have a long history of using flu vaccines, and the government has experience making a pandemic vaccine, keeping that stockpile, and getting it out to the public. That gives me hope that at least some people will be amenable to taking the necessary preventative measures, so any potential bird-flu outbreak among humans would not turn into COVID 2.0.\n\nListen.

Rick Bright, an expert on the H5N1 virus who served on President Biden's coronavirus advisory board, told me this is the crucial moment. \"There's a fine line between one person and 10 people with H5N1,\" he said. \"By the time we've detected 10, it's probably too late\" to contain.\n\nThat's when I told him what I'd heard from Sid Miller, the Texas commissioner for agriculture. He said he strongly suspected that the outbreak dated back to at least February. The commissioner speculated that back then, as much as 40 percent of the herds in the Texas panhandle may have been infected.\n\nDr. Bright fell silent, then asked a very reasonable question: \"Doesn't anyone keep tabs on this?\"\n\nThe H5N1 outbreak, already a devastating crisis for cattle farmers and their herds, has the potential to turn into an enormous tragedy for the rest of us. But having spent the past two weeks trying to get answers from our nation's public health authorities, I'm shocked by how little they seem to know about what's actually going on and how little of what they do know is being shared in a timely manner.\n\nHow exactly is the infection transmitted between herds? The United States Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all say they are working to figure it out.\n\nAccording to many public health officials, the virus load in the infected cows' milk is especially high, raising the possibility that the disease is being spread through milking machines or from aerosolized spray when the milking room floors are power washed. Another possible route is the cows' feed, owing to the fairly revolting fact that the U.S. allows farmers to feed leftover poultry bedding material -- feathers, excrement, spilled seeds -- to dairy and beef cattle as a cheap source of additional protein.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bright", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Bright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beef cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerosol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/24/opinion/00tufekci/00tufekci-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 78, "textEnd": 86}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

A former surgeon general says it feels like 2020 again.", "body": "The H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading through US cattle herds for the first time. The mammal-to-mammal transmission has scientists worried the virus could mutate to spread between humans. Former surgeon general Jerome Adams fears the US is making the mistakes of 2020 all over again.\n\nBird flu is flying wild. In recent months the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has been spreading through US cattle herds for the first time ever.\n\nThe cow-to-cow transmission is the latest escalation in a global outbreak that began when the virus reemerged in Europe in 2020. It has since killed tens of millions of birds and more than 40,000 sea lions and seals in South America.\n\nWorld Health Organization chief scientist Jeremy Farrar called this an \"animal pandemic\" on April 18.\n\nGenetic fragments of the virus, discovered in grocery store milk on Tuesday, suggest the cattle outbreak is more widespread than officials believed, The Washington Post reported.\n\nExperts told the Post that drinking pasteurized milk is probably still safe. Pasteurization deactivates pathogens, probably including H5N1, according to the Food and Drug Administration. However, no studies have specifically tested whether pasteurizing milk deactivates H5N1. According to the New York Times, the FDA is testing that now.\n\nOne human in Texas has tested positive for the virus after exposure to dairy cattle. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that person's only symptom was eye redness.\n\nThere has been no known human-to-human transmission. Still, future mutation could allow the virus to spread more easily to and between humans -- a possibility of \"great concern\" to Farrar.\n\nDr. Jerome Adams, a former surgeon general and the director of health equity at Purdue University, is getting deja vu.\n\n\"If it keeps spreading in animals, then it is eventually going to cause problems for humans, either because we don't have food because they've got to start exterminating flocks, or because it starts to make a jump in humans,\" Adams, who served under former President Donald Trump and was on the administration's initial COVID-19 task force, told Business Insider. \"The more it replicates, the more chances it has to mutate.\"\n\nThough he agrees with the CDC's assessment that the current risk to humans is low, Adams fears the US is repeating many mistakes it made in the early days of COVID-19.\n\nWeak messaging with no clear leaders\n\nWho is in charge of an animal pandemic in the US? The CDC? The US Department of Agriculture? The FDA?\n\nThe answer is, sort of, all of them. That decentralized responsibility could be behind the lack of widespread, clear public messaging so far.\n\nFor example, Adams says he hasn't changed anything about his diet, since pasteurization and proper cooking procedures should kill any live virus present. But he isn't sure everyone is getting the message.\n\nHe compared it to the development of COVID-19 vaccines, when people distrusted a process they didn't understand.\n\n\"The public needs good consistent communication from the White House, from the USDA, helping reassure them what the process is to keep them safe,\" Adams said.\n\nRather than consumers, the people most at risk are agricultural workers or anyone with close or prolonged exposure to chickens or cattle. It's those groups who need strong, targeted guidance right now, Adams said.\n\nOnly testing the sick\n\nSo far, the USDA has only been testing cattle herds when an animal appears sick. That means asymptomatic spread could be flying under the radar.\n\n\"An animal can't tell you, 'Hey, I feel a little under the weather today.' So they're literally waiting until an animal is collapsing or showing fatigue or showing severe symptoms,\" Adams said. \"We need a testing strategy that is proactive and allows true surveillance, and not reactive.\"\n\nThe USDA took a step forward on Wednesday, ordering that all lactating dairy cows must be tested for H5N1 before they're moved across state lines and that all positive test results must be reported.\n\nNew York Times columnist Zeynep Tufekci reported that same day that, until now, the USDA has not been keeping track of positive test results in cattle.\n\nElection distraction\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the big news story was the impeachment, and later acquittal, of President Trump. Now a different Trump trial is dominating the news.\n\nAnd, as in 2020, this is an election year.\n\n\"The Biden administration, particularly the White House, has been incredibly quiet on this bird flu situation. Why? To me, it looks like they very much don't want to scare the public and spook the economy in an election year,\" Adams said.\n\nBusiness vs. public health\n\nJust like the lockdowns of COVID-19 were devastating for the restaurant and hospitality industries, a crackdown on avian flu can be devastating to the chicken industry.\n\nThe treatment for a bird flu outbreak is to kill all the chickens. Even before that, just testing the flock can slow down production.\n\n\"We're seeing the same tension between business interests and public health interests,\" Adams said.\n\nWhat's more, many of the workers who handle chickens and cattle are undocumented immigrants. That can make them and their bosses hesitant to call in authorities over diseased animals.\n\nMany vulnerable groups were hesitant to report illness in the early COVID days, too, including migrant workers and people who didn't have sick leave from work.\n\n\"My concern is we keep making the same mistakes over and over again,\" Adams said. \"Because we keep focusing on the wrong things instead of focusing on the root causes.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors":

The data cited by the FDA is consistent with other studies demonstrating that the legally required temperature and time for milk pasteurization will readily inactivate HPAI.\n\nViral fragments detected after pasteurization are nothing more than evidence that the virus is dead and have zero impact on human health. Further, federal rules prohibit milk from sick cows from entering the food supply chain.\n\nThe National Milk Producers Federation and International Dairy Foods Association encourage the FDA to continue to gather scientific data and information that is consistent with its plans. The FDA has also remained consistent in its vigilance against raw milk consumption. Raw milk is a key vehicle in the transmission of human pathogens. As this situation continues to evolve, the dairy organizations strongly discourage the consumption of raw milk.\n\nIn response to recent concerns surrounding H5N1 Avian Influenza, South Dakota Department of Health Secretary, Melissa Magstadt, underscores collaborative efforts with the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources to safeguard the well-being of both the state's population and livestock.\n\n\"The Department of Health is working with the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources to ensure the safety of the people and livestock in South Dakota. It's important to note that the risk of human infection is low,\" said Department of Health Secretary, Melissa Magstadt. \"If you have had exposure to an H5N1-infected bird or animal and are showing signs and symptoms of infection, such as redness and swelling of the eye (conjunctivitis), cough, fever, or sore throat, visit your medical provider to be tested.\"\n\nCurrently, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or risk to consumer health. Dairies are required to ensure only milk from healthy animals enter the food supply chain. Additionally, the pasteurization process of heating milk to a high temperature ensures milk and dairy products can be safely consumed, as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In line with long-standing policy, the CDC does not recommend consuming unpasteurized milk or raw milk. Pasteurization has continually proven to successfully inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk.\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Agriculture (DANR) and the Animal Industry Board (AIB) have received confirmation from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) of the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a dairy cattle herd in South Dakota. This is the first confirmed case of HPAI in a dairy farm in South Dakota.\n\n\"South Dakota Dairy Producers encourages all dairy producers to closely monitor their herd and contact their herd veterinarian immediately if cattle appear symptomatic,\" said Marv Post, Chairman of South Dakota Dairy Producers. \"USDA continues to emphasize that pasteurization kills the virus and that milk and dairy products are safe to consume.\"\n\nSymptoms are mostly restricted to late-stage lactating cows and include a drop in milk production loss of appetite, and changes in manure consistency. Producers are encouraged to enforce their biosecurity plans such as limiting visitors, separating new animals and sick animals, and cleaning pens, equipment, vehicles, clothing, footwear, and hands.\n\nDairies are required to ensure only milk from healthy animals enter the food supply chain. Additionally, the pasteurization process of heating milk to a high temperature ensures milk and dairy products can be safely consumed, as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or risk to consumer health. In line with long-standing policy, the CDC does not recommend consuming unpasteurized milk or raw milk. Pasteurization has continually proven to successfully inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk.\n\nUSDA, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as state veterinary and public health officials, continue to investigate the emerging illness among dairy cows that is causing decreased lactation, low appetite, and other symptoms.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Agriculture received confirmation that Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza has been found in an Ohio dairy herd. The state's Department of Agriculture says it's the first case of HPAI in an Ohio livestock operation. The dairy operation received cows from a Texas dairy on March 8, 224, which was the same dairy that later reported a confirmed HPAI detection in Texas. Ohio's animal health officials were notified when the livestock began showing clinical signs compatible with sick, lactating dairy cows in other states.\n\nThe USDA, Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and state veterinary health officials are investigating the emerging illness among dairy cattle that's causing decreased lactation, low appetite, and other symptoms. The FDA and CDC say there is no concern about the safety of commercially pasteurized dairy products due to federal health requirements and pasteurization. The public health risk associated with HPAI remains low.\n\nOfficials from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have confirmed the presence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in a Michigan dairy herd. That herd recently added cattle from Texas, one of the first states to report HPAI in dairy cattle. A University of Minnesota Extension article says APHIS also shared presumptive positive samples from New Mexico, Idaho, Ohio, and Texas.\n\nThe Idaho Department of Agriculture announced cattle in the state have tested positive for HPAI. HPAI historically affects birds but has been documented in cats, skunks, and foxes.\n\nThe virus found in Michigan is very similar to the viruses found in Texas and Kansas and appears to have been introduced into the cattle by wild birds.\n\nIn Idaho, the virus may have been transmitted from cow to cow.\n\nUSDA has stated that initial testing has not found changes to the virus that would make it easier to transmit to humans.\n\nAfter HPAI was found in dairy cattle, the Meat Institute says that properly prepared beef is safe to eat and not a safety risk to humans. \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USDA food safety experts say properly prepared beef is safe to eat,\" says Meat Institute President and CEO Julie Anna Potts. \"HPAI cannot be transmitted to humans by eating meat or poultry products.\" She also says the Meat Institute and its member companies will continue to be vigilant to aid in the efforts to stop the spread of the disease among animals in food production. \"We will support the nation's producers working to protect their herds,\" Potts adds. The meat and poultry industries are among the most intensely regulated in the nation. Inspectors from the Food Safety and Inspection Service are present every day in meat packing plants and are trained to detect disease before and after slaughter.\n\nUNDATED (AP)- Milk from dairy cows in Texas and Kansas has tested positive for bird flu, U.S. officials said Monday (March 25, 2024).\n\nOfficials with the Texas Animal Health Commission confirmed the flu virus is the Type A H5N1 strain, known for decades to cause outbreaks in birds and to occasionally infect people. The virus is affecting older dairy cows in those states and in New Mexico, causing decreased lactation and low appetite.\n\nIt comes a week after officials in Minnesota announced that goats on a farm where there had been an outbreak of bird flu among poultry were diagnosed with the virus. It's believed to be the first time bird flu -- also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza -- was found in U.S. livestock.\n\nThe commercial milk supply is safe and risk to people is low, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Dairies are required to only allow milk from healthy animals to enter the food supply, and milk from the sick animals is being diverted or destroyed. Pasteurization also kills viruses and other bacteria, and the process is required for milk sold through interstate commerce, the agency said.\n\n\"At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health,\" the USDA said in a statement.\n\nThe federal government said its tests in the cattle did not detect any changes to the virus that would make it spread more easily to people.\n\nDairy farmers in Texas first became concerned three weeks ago when cattle started falling ill with what officials called \"mystery dairy cow disease,\" Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. Milk production fell sharply and the cows were lethargic and weren't eating much.\n\n\"We hadn't seen anything like it before,\" he said. \"It was kind of like they had a cold.\"\n\nThe state's animal health commission began an investigation that included tests for bird flu, spokeswoman Erin Robinson said. Based on findings from Texas, USDA officials think the cows got the virus from infected wild birds.\n\nExperts say livestock appear to recover on their own within seven to 10 days. That's different than bird flu outbreaks in poultry, which necessitate killing flocks to get rid of the virus. Since 2022, outbreaks have affected about 82 million wild and commercial birds in the U.S.\n\nSo far, the virus appears to be infecting about 10% of lactating dairy cows in the affected herds, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian and and biosecurity expert with the University of California-Davis Western Institute for Food Safety and Security.\n\n\"This doesn't look anything like the high-path influenza in bird flocks,\" he said.\n\nBird flu was detected in unpasteurized, clinical samples of milk from sick cattle collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas. The virus was also found in a nose and throat swab from another dairy in Texas.\n\nOfficials called it a rapidly evolving situation. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are involved, along with officials in the three states. Another dairy-heavy state, Iowa, said it is monitoring the situation.\n\nDairy industry officials said that producers have started enhanced biosecurity efforts on U.S. farms, including limiting the amount of traffic into and out of properties and restricting visits to employees and essential personnel.\n\nBird flu previously has been reported in 48 different mammal species, Payne noted, adding: \"It was probably only a matter of time before avian influenza made its way to ruminants.\"\n\nStatement from the National Milk Producers Federation, the International Dairy Foods Association, the U.S. Dairy Export Council and Dairy Management Inc.:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed (March 25, 2024) highly pathogenic avian influenza has been found in two dairy cattle herds in Texas and two herds in Kansas. USDA also confirmed that there is no threat to human health and milk and dairy products remain safe to consume. Pasteurization (high heat treatment) kills harmful microbes and pathogens in milk, including the influenza virus. To provide context on the overall size of the U.S. dairy herd, there are more 9.3 million dairy cows in the United States.\n\nAlso, routine testing and well-established protocols for U.S. dairy will continue to ensure that only safe milk enters the food supply. In keeping with the federal Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO), milk from sick cows must be collected separately and is not allowed to enter the food supply chain. This means affected dairy cows are segregated, as is normal practice with any animal health concern, and their milk does not enter the food supply.\n\nConsumers in the United States and around the world can remain confident in the safety and quality of U.S. dairy.\n\nWhat is Pasteurization?\n\nPasteurization is a process that kills harmful bacteria and pathogens, including viruses, by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time. The processing of milk products involves pasteurization of the raw milk to a minimum of 161.5\u02daF for 15 seconds and then immediately cooling it. Ultra pasteurization is a process that heats milk at a higher temperature for specified times to extend a product's shelf life.\n\nWhat is Avian Influenza?\n\nDetections of avian influenza in birds, including chickens, are common in the United States in the spring and fall due to wild birds spreading the virus as they migrate to and from their seasonal homes. While it is uncommon for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza to affect dairy cows, USDA APHIS has been tracking detections of HPAI in mammals for many years in the United States, leading dairy farmers and veterinarians in the United States to prepare for this eventuality. As a result, dairy farmers have taken immediate measures to enhance biosecurity measures in and around dairy farms to keep the food supply safe.\n\nAbout the Illness in Cows\n\nDairy producers with affected cows are reporting a rapid onset illness in herds, specifically among older, lactating cows. Clinical signs include:\n\nAccording to dairy farmers and veterinarians reporting on affected herds, most affected cows recover within two to three weeks.\n\nThe National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) is aware that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in samples collected from dairy cattle in the United States. Importantly, the agency confirmed there is no threat to human health, and milk and meat remains safe to consume. USDA has confirmed that affected dairy cows do not appear to be transmitting the virus to other cattle within the same herd.\n\nAt present, HPAI has not been detected in beef cattle. However, producers are encouraged to implement enhanced biosecurity measures on their farms and ranches to help protect their herds. For more information on animal health protocols and developing an effective biosecurity plan, cattle farmers and ranchers are encouraged to visit www.bqa.org, and complete or update their certification in Beef Quality Assurance practices. Producers can also visit usda.gov for resources on how to manage wildlife to limit exposure to HPAI.", "source": {"uri": "drgnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DRGNews"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She has about 500 dairy cows on the farm.\n\nAmid these concerns over bird flu, she is taking precautions of her own to protect her animals - and people. She is limiting visitors at the farm, and when there are visitors they wash their boots and hands and have no direct contact with animals.\n\n\"It's important to just protect everybody, not just the cows, not just the dairy farms, also the workers because humans can be taken all of that to their house,\" said Alison Pfau, regional dairy education at UW Division of Extension.\n\nSchultz is also keeping the areas they come into contact with extra clean and makes sure that large groups of birds are not hanging around the cows.\n\n\"When something like this happens, it's just an opportunity for us to review our bio-security, and it gives us an opportunity to just make sure that you're paying that extra attention to those animals,\" she said.\n\nRecently, 33 cow herds were infected across eight states.

A former surgeon general says it feels like 2020 again.", "body": "World Health Organization chief scientist Jeremy Farrar called this an \"animal pandemic\" on April 18.\n\nGenetic fragments of the virus, discovered in grocery store milk on Tuesday, suggest the cattle outbreak is more widespread than officials believed, The Washington Post reported.\n\nExperts told the Post that drinking pasteurized milk is probably still safe. Pasteurization deactivates pathogens, probably including H5N1, according to the Food and Drug Administration. However, no studies have specifically tested whether pasteurizing milk deactivates H5N1. According to the New York Times, the FDA is testing that now.\n\nOne human in Texas has tested positive for the virus after exposure to dairy cattle. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that person's only symptom was eye redness.\n\nThere has been no known human-to-human transmission. Still, future mutation could allow the virus to spread more easily to and between humans -- a possibility of \"great concern\" to Farrar.\n\nDr. Jerome Adams, a former surgeon general and the director of health equity at Purdue University, is getting deja vu.\n\n\"If it keeps spreading in animals, then it is eventually going to cause problems for humans, either because we don't have food because they've got to start exterminating flocks, or because it starts to make a jump in humans,\" Adams, who served under former President Donald Trump and was on the administration's initial COVID-19 task force, told Business Insider. \"The more it replicates, the more chances it has to mutate.\"\n\nThough he agrees with the CDC's assessment that the current risk to humans is low, Adams fears the US is repeating many mistakes it made in the early days of COVID-19.\n\nWho is in charge of an animal pandemic in the US? The CDC? The US Department of Agriculture? The FDA?\n\nThe answer is, sort of, all of them. That decentralized responsibility could be behind the lack of widespread, clear public messaging so far.\n\nFor example, Adams says he hasn't changed anything about his diet, since pasteurization and proper cooking procedures should kill any live virus present. But he isn't sure everyone is getting the message.\n\nHe compared it to the development of COVID-19 vaccines, when people distrusted a process they didn't understand.\n\n\"The public needs good consistent communication from the White House, from the USDA, helping reassure them what the process is to keep them safe,\" Adams said.\n\nRather than consumers, the people most at risk are agricultural workers or anyone with close or prolonged exposure to chickens or cattle. It's those groups who need strong, targeted guidance right now, Adams said.\n\nSo far, the USDA has only been testing cattle herds when an animal appears sick. That means asymptomatic spread could be flying under the radar.\n\n\"An animal can't tell you, 'Hey, I feel a little under the weather today.' So they're literally waiting until an animal is collapsing or showing fatigue or showing severe symptoms,\" Adams said. \"We need a testing strategy that is proactive and allows true surveillance, and not reactive.\"\n\nThe USDA took a step forward on Wednesday, ordering that all lactating dairy cows must be tested for H5N1 before they're moved across state lines and that all positive test results must be reported.\n\nNew York Times columnist Zeynep Tufekci reported that same day that, until now, the USDA has not been keeping track of positive test results in cattle.\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the big news story was the impeachment, and later acquittal, of President Trump. Now a different Trump trial is dominating the news.\n\nAnd, as in 2020, this is an election year.\n\n\"The Biden administration, particularly the White House, has been incredibly quiet on this bird flu situation. Why? To me, it looks like they very much don't want to scare the public and spook the economy in an election year,\" Adams said.\n\nJust like the lockdowns of COVID-19 were devastating for the restaurant and hospitality industries, a crackdown on avian flu can be devastating to the chicken industry.\n\nThe treatment for a bird flu outbreak is to kill all the chickens. Even before that, just testing the flock can slow down production.\n\n\"We're seeing the same tension between business interests and public health interests,\" Adams said.\n\nWhat's more, many of the workers who handle chickens and cattle are undocumented immigrants. That can make them and their bosses hesitant to call in authorities over diseased animals.\n\nMany vulnerable groups were hesitant to report illness in the early COVID days, too, including migrant workers and people who didn't have sick leave from work.\n\n\"My concern is we keep making the same mistakes over and over again,\" Adams said. \"Because we keep focusing on the wrong things instead of focusing on the root causes.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_mcfall_johnsen@businessinsider.com", "name": "Morgan McFall-Johnsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purdue University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC?", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CDC?"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/662a732023b29110d302fdd8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509928", "eventUri": "eng-9509928", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 92, "textEnd": 100}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

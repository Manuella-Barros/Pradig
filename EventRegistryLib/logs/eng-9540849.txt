The study marks the first robust quantification of the global relationship between plastic production and pollution.\n\nThe research, led by scientists from a dozen different universities in the United States of America, Australia, the Philippines, New Zealand, Estonia, Chile, Sweden, Canada, and the United Kingdom, found that 56 global companies are responsible for more than half of all branded plastic pollution.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company was responsible for 11% of branded waste, followed by PepsiCo (5%), Nestl\u00e9 (3%), Danone (3%), and Altria/Philip Morris International (2%). The top companies identified produce food, beverage, or tobacco products.\n\nThe five-year analysis used #BreakFreeFromPlastic brand audit data from 1,576 audit events across 84 countries. Brand audits are citizen science initiatives in which volunteers conduct waste clean-ups and document the brands found on the pollution collected. Over five years, more than 200,000 volunteers submitted data through Break Free From Plastic or 5 Gyres' TrashBlitz app.\n\nThe strong relationship between plastic production and pollution, across geographies and widely varying waste management systems, suggests that reducing plastic production in the fast-moving consumer goods sector is a viable solution to curb global plastic pollution. As world leaders negotiate a Global Plastics Treaty at INC-4 this month in Ottawa, Canada, this research serves as a tool to support a high-ambition legally binding treaty that includes provisions on corporate accountability, prioritizing plastic production reduction measures, and promoting reuse and refill systems.\n\n\"When I first saw the relationship between production and pollution, I was shocked. I wanted to throw up, it was the reality of my worst nightmare. It means that producers big and small are toeing the line, despite all the things big brands say they are doing, we see no positive impact from their efforts. But on the other hand, it gives me hope that fast-moving consumer goods companies reducing their plastic production and shifting towards more durable and reusable products would have a strong positive impact on the environment,\" said Win Cowger, Research Director, The Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research.\n\n\"Our study underscores the critical role of corporate accountability in tackling plastic pollution. We, as individuals, are not responsible for the plastics crisis; the onus lies on these 56 global companies to take decisive action. I urge world leaders at INC-4 to listen to the science, and to consider the clear link between plastic production and pollution during negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty,\" said Dr. Lisa Erdle, Director of Science & Innovation, The 5 Gyres Institute.\n\n\"This scientific study affirms what activists and communities impacted by plastic pollution have been saying for years: the more plastic is produced, the more plastic is found in the environment. It's that simple. Yet again, plastic polluters like The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and Nestl\u00e9 continue to fail on their voluntary commitment to reduce their plastic footprint. We need a legally binding Global Plastics Treaty that mandates significant cuts in plastic production and stops corporations from flooding the planet with single-use plastic,\" added Sybil Bullock, Associate Campaign Manager, Break Free From Plastic.\n\n\"The research identifies the top 56 multinational companies contributing to global branded plastic litter. Past studies have ranked countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nigeria, etc. among the top sources of plastic waste into the ocean. This has led to a narrative in social media that blames poor countries for global plastic pollution, ignoring the fact that around the 1960s global companies flooded developing countries with cheap, single-use plastics displacing traditional biodegradable materials and sustainable reuse-refill systems which, in the case of the Philippines, dated back to the 16th century. The current study focuses instead on the role of corporations and global plastic production,\" said Dr. Jorge Emmanuel, Adjunct Professor and Research Faculty Fellow, Institute of Environmental & Marine Sciences, and College of Engineering & Design, Silliman University.\n\n\"This research provides the first quantification of global producer contribution to branded plastic pollution. The findings suggest that single-use packaging significantly contributes to branded plastic pollution. This data can help inform ways to address plastic production and reduce plastic waste ending up in the environment,\" concluded Dr. Kathy Willis, Postdoctoral Fellow from CSIRO, Australia's national science.\n\nBreakFreeFromPlastic is a global movement envisioning a future free from plastic pollution. Since its launch in 2016, more than 2,000 organizations and 11,000 individual supporters from across the world have joined the movement to demand massive reductions in single-use plastics and push for lasting solutions to the plastic pollution crisis. BFFP member organizations and individuals share the values of environmental protection and social justice and work together through a holistic approach to bring about systemic change. This means tackling plastic pollution across the whole plastics value chain - from extraction to disposal - focusing on prevention rather than cure and providing effective solutions.\n\nThe 5 Gyres Institute (5 Gyres) is a leader in the global movement against plastic pollution with more\n\nthan 10 years of expertise in scientific research, engagement, and education. With the original goal of\n\nanswering a few key scientific questions about ocean plastics, co- founders Marcus Eriksen and Anna\n\nCummins led 19 research expeditions in all five subtropical gyres, as well as many of the world's lakes\n\nand rivers. 5 Gyres continues to lead with scientific research to drive upstream solutions through\n\neducation, advocacy, and community building.", "source":

A major bone of contention between negotiators from 175 countries is whether or not to limit the production of plastic, most of which is made from fossil fuels and chemicals and which causes pollution after use, as it does not fully or easily biodegrade.\n\nDespite several rounds of talks, the pervasive plastic problem remains unresolved. A final round of talks is scheduled to be held in South Korea at the end of this year.\n\nAmid global struggles to curb plastic pollution, the United Kingdom said last month that it would introduce legislation to ban wet wipes which contain plastic. Wet wipes made with plastic have been shown to leach harmful microplastics into the environment after they have been disposed of.\n\nEveryone knows that plastic bags are a blight on the environment, but what other everyday items - also known as \"invisible plastics - unexpectedly contain plastic or harmful \"microplastics\" and is there a solution?\n\nThese are items which are seemingly not made of plastic - such as wet wipes - but which, once disposed of, release plastic into the environment.\n\n\"Invisible plastics are everywhere,\" Tony Walker, a professor at the School for Resource and Environmental Studies at Dalhousie University in Canada who also belongs to the Scientists' Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, said.\n\n\"In terms of global plastic production, which includes things like the table I'm sat at, the chair I'm sat on, my computer - you name it, it probably contains a plastic of some kind.\"\n\nNot all plastic needs to be eliminated, he said, particularly if it is used to make furniture which could last for several decades.\n\nREAD | Plastic pollution talks move closer to world-first pact\n\nSingle-use items containing plastic should be the focus, he added. These are adding to the \"tonnes of plastic that are sitting in our landfills\", he said, often leaching harmful microplastics into the environment.\n\nMicroplastics are tiny particles of plastic which can even make their way into our food - for example by first being broken down and ingested by fish when they get into the sea. Walker added that even so-called \"biodegradable plastic\", which is advertised as being able to break down naturally once disposed of, can contain microplastics.\n\nSome other everyday items which surprisingly contain plastic are:\n\nWhat are countries doing about this problem?\n\nDuring a session of the United Nations Environment Assembly in March 2022, a landmark resolution was adopted to draft an international legally binding treaty on plastic pollution.\n\nUnder the resolution, an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) including representatives from 175 countries, has been holding talks with the aim of drafting a treaty by the end of this year. Previous sessions have convened in Uruguay, France and Kenya. The fourth session wrapped up this week in Canada and the last one will be held between November and December in South Korea.\n\nThis time, major disagreements about limiting the amount of plastic manufactured globally arose.\n\nEnvironmental experts say it is crucial that they reach an agreement on this issue. Plastic production continues to rise around the world and the annual production of fossil fuel-based plastic is projected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to triple by 2060 if nothing changes.\n\nThe head of Greenpeace in Ottawa, Graham Forbes, said that it will be impossible to end plastic pollution without massively reducing plastic production.\n\n\"Current global production [of plastic] is over 400 million metric tons [tonnes] annually,\" said Walker. \"However, we're recycling on average as a planet, only 9%. That leaves 91% of 400 million metric tons as waste.\"\n\nREAD | Pollution cleanup means Paris may open first urban beaches on the Seine as soon as next year\n\nThis is mainly down to economic factors, experts say.\n\nSome \"have vested interest in producing plastic products or petroleum products\", Walker explained. These countries believe that stopping the production of plastic would hurt their economies, he added.\n\nExperts are calling on countries represented at the INC to work much harder to reach a consensus on the production of plastic before the end of this year.\n\nWalker pointed out that plastic is a transboundary pollutant, crossing rivers and borders, meaning countries should have a vested interest in tackling this issue. \"Plastics are now in the atmosphere, in the air we breathe, so they're actually travelling between continents on air currents,\" said Walker.", "source": {"uri":

Despite the fortitude of countries within the High Ambition Coalition like Rwanda and Peru, negotiations on the agenda of intersessional work leading up to the final session in November in Busan, Korea, left the crucial aspect of reducing plastic production off the table.\n\nDivergence surrounding the root causes of plastic pollution was ignited by the overwhelming presence of the fossil fuel and chemical industry. And their impact was not hard to miss, with pro-plastic campaigners outside the Shaw Center where negotiations were held and nearly 200 lobbyists registering for the talks, even joining country delegations, according to a Center for International Environmental Law analysis. Their influence is far-reaching. Notably, the US, being the world's largest contributor to plastic waste, has not taken a stance on production.\n\nI conveyed this message on Earth Day during a youth coalition meeting with US Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jeff Merkley, Welch, and representative Jared Huffman. I advocated for the negotiators to prioritise increasing protections for human rights and ocean health by centring justice.\n\nDespite widespread discussions on the environmental and human health risks of plastics, there is still a noticeable gap in recognising the interconnected injustices they perpetuate -- though the Global Youth Coalition on Plastic Pollution and Indigenous Peoples' Caucus were adamant about these connections in their plenary statements. While plastics impact everyone -- microplastics are in our air, food, water, soil, and bodies, even human placentas -- disproportionate negative impacts occur across race, occupation, ethnicity, class, gender, and age.\n\nOutside the plastics context, voices like Dr Ayana Elizabeth Johnson have brought justice to the forefront of ocean conservation, while Leah Thomas is the leading activist for Intersectional Environmentalism. As a Gen Z advocate deeply immersed in ocean advocacy, in my view, this is what the plastics conversation still needs: utilising an intersectional approach to shed light on how the full plastic lifecycle -- from creation to waste -- represents an ocean justice crisis.\n\nUPON returning from the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment (INC-4), I went to the beach for rest and was, paradoxically, as usual, immediately picking up plastic waste. And still, I acknowledge my privileged position -- that ocean currents are naturally not bringing as much pollution to the North Carolina coast as they are to vulnerable island countries. Each year 11 million metric tons of plastic enter the seas, devastating wildlife, contaminating seafood, and polluting beaches. But, those most severely affected are often the least culpable: island countries, indigenous peoples, and the Global South. This pollution is compounded by the plastic loads high GDP countries export to the Global South, a trend called 'waste colonialism.'\n\nUndeniably, the ocean is profoundly impacted by plastic pollution, evident in the vast gyres twice the size of Texas and the grim prediction that by 2050, 99 per cent of seabirds will have ingested plastics.\n\nNot only does this pollution entangle marine life and release toxic chemicals, scientists are beginning to worry it is threatening the ability of the ocean to sequester carbon. Zooplankton are microscopic animals that are now replacing their plant diet with microplastics, and this trend on a large scale is hypothesized to hinder the release of carbon to the deep sea.\n\nDESPITE widespread support by countries for including human rights in the plastics treaty, there are no obligations to protect the rights of indigenous peoples, of informal waste pickers whose livelihoods depend on plastic collection, or of anyone. In a report, Earth Law Center reviewed nearly 400 statements across 175 member states to the INC and mapped support by country. Unsurprisingly, regions across the Global South experiencing the brunt of plastic pollution and human rights injustices demonstrated the highest support.\n\nMany people don't know not to microwave plastic. Just as many are not aware that there are 16,000 chemicals associated with plastics and over one in four are hazardous to people. Or that microplastics are found in human blood and we don't know the consequences yet. However, this awareness is largely not the fault of the public. The plastic industry intentionally keeps us in the dark, having us thinking that plastic is non-toxic and safe to use, and even fooling us that recycling is the end-all solution. Banning and phasing out concerning chemicals and single-use plastics while increasing plastic literacy is key to protecting human rights, ensuring industries are transparent, and empowering everyone to make informed decisions.\n\nACCORDING to UN Environment Program, the plastic lifecycle is a barrier to every Sustainable Development Goal. Without immediate action to reduce plastic production, we risk our chance to keep the 1.5\u00b0C target within reach. Much like the case of climate change, those who bear the worst impacts of plastics gain the fewest benefits from their production or use. Black, indigenous, and people of colour communities are disproportionately harmed by toxic chemicals and emissions from unfair proximity to petrochemical and incineration facilities. Women and people who menstruate are exposed to microplastics within period products. The bottom line is plastics exacerbate inequities and harm those most vulnerable among us.\n\nRight now, the word 'justice' is not in the plastics treaty text at all. As the outcomes of negotiations unfold, I hope that plastics will be reframed as what they truly are: an ocean justice crisis. The treaty, slated for finalisation by the end of 2024, represents a pivotal opportunity to safeguard human rights and address injustice. There are undeniable implications for people, the ocean, and truly, the planet at stake.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English

initiative will create 10,000 jobs, generate $4.8 million: USAID", "body": "Melissa Jones, Mission Director, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Nigeria, says the newly launched Nigeria plastic solutions initiative will create 10,000 jobs and generate $4.8 million in income.\n\nMs Jones made this known in her remarks at the launch of the Nigeria plastic solutions activity, an initiative equally funded by USAID and the Coca-Cola Foundation, on Monday, in Lagos.\n\nThe launch had the theme, \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Building a Sustainable Future.\"\n\nThe Nigeria plastic solutions activity is a 24-month initiative being implemented by TechnoServe Nigeria, in collaboration with its partner, the Growing Businesses Foundation (GBF).\n\nThis initiative seeks to tackle the critical challenge of plastic waste management in Nigeria through innovative recycling solutions.\n\nMr Jones said the goal of the activity was to recycle 49,000 metric tons of plastic waste produced in Lagos and Anambra states over the next two years.\n\nShe added that by recycling plastics, the environment was safeguarded and pathways to economic empowerment for underemployed Nigerians unlocked.\n\nAccording to her, Nigeria is the ninth highest contributor to plastic pollution, with about 2.5 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, over 88 percent of which is not recycled.\n\nThe result of this, she said, is excessive plastic pollution, which threatens ecosystems, marine life, and public health.\n\n\"It is plastic pollution that clogs our waterways, mars our landscapes, kills thousands of marine animals, and releases toxins into the environment.\n\n\"Firstly, plastics recycling reduces the demand for virgin materials, curbing the energy-intensive process of producing new plastics by up to 90 per cent and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent.\n\n\"Recycling plastics also reduces the amount of plastic entering the ocean by 80 per cent.\n\n\"The 49,000 metric tons of plastics collected and recycled under the Nigeria Plastic Solutions Activity will contribute to efforts to achieve these targets and the overall goal of a more sustainable and circular plastics economy in Nigeria,\" she said.\n\nMs Jones added that asides improving the environment, plastic collection, sorting, aggregating, processing and manufacturing offers employment opportunities.\n\nOn her part, small and medium scale enterprises and entry-level and semi-skilled workers particularly stand to benefit from this new value chain.\n\n\"Because barriers to entry in the recycling sector are relatively low, the National Plastic Solutions Activity will be able to employ marginalised groups including women, youth, and people with disabilities.\"\n\nShe noted that USAID would provide an enabling environment to improve the competitiveness, sustainability, and profitability of numerous collectors, aggregators and recyclers.\n\nShe said plastics recycling is not just an environmental imperative, it's a catalyst for sustainable development and economic prosperity.\n\nGeneral manager, Coca-Cola Nigeria Ltd, Mariam Khan said her company remained committed to creating shared opportunities and making a difference in communities.\n\nShe noted that the initiative was not just about cleaning up but also about positively impacting lives and creating jobs.\n\n\"This programme is a key illustration of what collaborative efforts can do for the society and the ripple effect of this will be significant,\" she said.\n\nIn her remarks, Adesuwa Akinboro, country director, Nigeria, TechnoServe said the activity aims to reduce plastic waste in Lagos and Anambra states by at least 49,000 metric tons, through inclusive, market-driven interventions along the value chain.\n\nAccording to her, a fundamental aspect of the approach is the emphasis on developing market systems to drive the circular economy.\n\n\"We recognise the complexities within the plastic waste recycling value chain and are committed to addressing these challenges through innovative solutions that will enable sustainable practices and create inclusive job opportunities.\n\n\"Our collaborative model ensures that we remain accountable and effective in achieving our waste reduction and recycling targets, reinforcing our commitment to environmental stewardship,\" she noted.", "source": {"uri": "gazettengr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Peoples Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victor_olorunfemi@gazettengr.com", "name": "Victor Olorunfemi",

The International Union for Conservation of Nature explained that ocean organisms sometimes eat this waste and it moves up the food web, eventually ending up in our bodies. This is dangerous, as several chemicals used in plastic production are known carcinogens that can cause developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune disorders in humans and wildlife.\n\nAnd according to the study's lead author, Alice Zhu, the estimate of plastic pollution sitting on the ocean floor could be 100 times more than what we believe is floating on the surface.\n\nWe already know that ocean plastics endanger wildlife like seabirds, whales, fish, and turtles who may mistake plastic for prey. Most of these animals die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with plastic, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. They can also suffer from lacerations, infections, reduced ability to swim, and internal injuries, the organization said. Similarly, plastic waste on the ocean floor affects plants and animals who live and hunt in this zone, and can move up the food chain.\n\nLuckily, a number of companies and governments are hopping on board to reduce plastic pollution. For instance, McDonald's U.K. has banned all plastic cutlery. And major beer brands like Coors Light are getting rid of plastic packaging rings.\n\nMeanwhile, a lot of plastic alternatives are popping up, and scientists have discovered how to break down plastic using hungry wax worms and fungus.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CSIRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phys.org", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phys.org"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microplastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metric system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_sediment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine sediment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Union for Conservation of Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_bag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic bag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5aHpF0r4F0J9KX98Xq5oww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/ca0eda07b537c3f63043f450c979a734", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540849", "eventUri": "eng-9540849", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Some 94% of Filipino respondents believed that a cap on plastic production would stop plastic pollution, prevent biodiversity loss, and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThis would be welcome news to negotiators from around the world who met from April 23-29, 2024, in Ottawa, Canada, to hammer out a United Nations (UN) treaty to end plastic pollution, including its scourge on the marine environment.\n\nIn 2022, the assembly began negotiations in Uruguay and planned to finalise a treaty in South Korea in November.\n\nLet's consider the extent of our single-use plastic problem and its impact on the world's oceans and biodiversity.\n\nIn 2019, Filipinos consumed 163 million sachets, 48 million shopping bags, 45 million thin film (labo) bags, and three million pieces of diapers every day, according to the environmental justice group Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (Gaia).\n\nThe latest brand audit by Gaia has shown that the \"sachet culture\" in the Philippines and South-East Asia is widespread, which is causing harm to marine life and clogging waterways.\n\nGaia released the report before the Earth Day celebration last month.\n\nEvery year, the Philippines generates 2.7 million tonnes of plastic waste.\n\nMost of the plastic waste ends up in landfills and bodies of water (20% of which ends up in the ocean) due to the combination of these two factors: the proliferation of single-use plastics combined with a very weak waste management system.\n\nUsing the study of Meijer et al. (2021), Our World in Data, a scientific online publication, revealed that plastic pollution in the Philippines reached 36.38% in 2019, followed by India (12.92%) and Malaysia (7.46%).\n\nAccording to GreenMatch, the Philippines has the highest annual output of ocean plastic waste (356,371 tonnes) compared with the plastic waste produced by India (126,513), Malaysia (73,098), China (70,707), and Indonesia (56,333).\n\nThe figures are baffling to Sonia Mendoza, chair of Mother Earth Foundation, an environmental group that is championing a \"zero waste\" philosophy in waste management.\n\nMendoza noted that China is the largest plastic producer. Statista.com states that China produced 32% of global plastic in 2022. The rest of Asia accounted for only 19%, while North America supplied 17%.\n\nAccording to GreenMatch, China was only recycling 16 million tonnes of plastic waste out of a total of 60 million tonnes.\n\nThe UN Environmental Program did not rank nations but confirmed that the highest share of the world's marine litter and plastic pollution came from Asia, with China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam considered \"hotspots.\"Drop in the bucket. Efforts to recycle plastic waste in our community are numerous, but scaling them up to become national programmes is a challenge.\n\nThese include the various ordinances in Metro Manila that ban the use of plastic bags; but why can't authorities compel all local government units nationwide to do so? A barangay in Cavite is doling out a kg of rice for every kg of plastic waste.\n\nZero waste\n\nThe \"zero waste\" campaign in Potrero, Malabon is harnessing the community's power to separate waste at source, recycle nontoxic plastics, and compost food waste.\n\nCommendable as they are, these are just a small drop in the bucket in an ocean of single-use plastics.\n\nMendoza is therefore pushing for a ban on single-use plastics and reducing plastic production.\n\nComparing plastic production to a water tap, she said: \"Our goal is to close the tap. The tap can't be opened while the bathtub is overflowing because only 9% of plastic waste is recycled globally.\"No matter how we argue about it, we will always come to the same conclusion: Single-use plastics are a scourge that should be stopped. Easily refuted\n\nThe argument that the ban would be anti-poor, since sari-sari stores (neighbourhood retailers) sell cheaper goods in sachets, can be easily refuted.\n\nBack in the day, we used to bring our own used bottles when buying vinegar, oil, and other condiments.\n\nInstant coffee wasn't always packaged in sachets. They were mostly sold in glass jars that could be reused later as coffee mugs or containers.\n\nToday, sachets are available even at the most luxurious convenience stores and supermarkets. Convenience is the name of the game, illustrating that big manufacturers have exploited people and the planet solely for the sake of profit. -- Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN\n\nMichael Lim Ubac is a former reporter and editor of the Philippine Daily Inquirer.

10,000 jobs and generate $4.8 million in income.\n\nJones made this known in her remarks at the launch of the Nigeria Plastic Solutions Activity, an initiative equally funded by USAID and the Coca-Cola Foundation, on Monday, in Lagos.\n\nThe launch had the theme, \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Building a Sustainable Future.\"\n\nThe Nigeria Plastic Solutions Activity is a 24-month initiative being implemented by TechnoServe Nigeria, in collaboration with its partner, the Growing Businesses Foundation (GBF).\n\nThis initiative seeks to tackle the critical challenge of plastic waste management in Nigeria through innovative recycling solutions.\n\nJones said the goal of the activity was to recycle 49,000 metric tons of plastic waste produced in Lagos and Anambra states over the next two years.\n\nShe added that by recycling plastics, the environment was safeguarded and pathways to economic empowerment for underemployed Nigerians unlocked.\n\nAccording to her, Nigeria is the ninth highest contributor to plastic pollution, with about 2.5 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, over 88 percent of which is not recycled.\n\nThe result of this, she said, is excessive plastic pollution, which threatens ecosystems, marine life, and public health.\n\n\"It is plastic pollution that clogs our waterways, mars our landscapes, kills thousands of marine animals, and releases toxins into the environment.\n\n\"Firstly, plastics recycling reduces the demand for virgin materials, curbing the energy-intensive process of producing new plastics by up to 90 per cent and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent.\n\n\"Recycling plastics also reduces the amount of plastic entering the ocean by 80 per cent.\n\n\"The 49,000 metric tons of plastics collected and recycled under the Nigeria Plastic Solutions Activity will contribute to efforts to achieve these targets and the overall goal of a more sustainable and circular plastics economy in Nigeria,\" she said.\n\nJones added that asides improving the environment, plastic collection, sorting, aggregating, processing and manufacturing offers employment opportunities.\n\nOn her part, Small and medium scale enterprises and entry-level and semi-skilled workers particularly stand to benefit from this new value chain.\n\n\"Because barriers to entry in the recycling sector are relatively low, the National Plastic Solutions Activity will be able to employ marginalised groups including women, youth, and people with disabilities.\"\n\nShe noted that USAID would provide an enabling environment to improve the competitiveness, sustainability, and profitability of numerous collectors, aggregators and recyclers.\n\nOn her part, plastics recycling is not just an environmental imperative, it's a catalyst for sustainable development and economic prosperity.\n\nGeneral Manager, Coca-Cola Nigeria Ltd, Mariam Khan said her company remained committed to creating shared opportunities and making a difference in communities.\n\nShe noted that the initiative was not just about cleaning up but also about positively impacting lives and creating jobs.\n\n\"This programme is a key illustration of what collaborative efforts can do for the society and the ripple effect of this will be significant,\" she said.\n\nIn her remarks, Adesuwa Akinboro Country Director, Nigeria, TechnoServe said the activity aims to reduce plastic waste in Lagos and Anambra states by at least 49,000 metric tons, through inclusive, market-driven interventions along the value chain.\n\nAccording to her, a

We need to do a better job of all these things for different types of plastics\".\n\nHe said one of the most pressing issues affecting the environment and planet is plastic pollution and Lagos as a passionate steward of the environment is desirous to join millions of others to confront the challenges of plastic pollution and attendant adverse impacts on the environment and public health and lining up to be counted.\n\nHe stressed that plastic pollution is not just an environmental issue, it has also become a social, health and economic issue that requires the collective commitment of everyone who is sincere about protecting the planet.\n\nHe recalled that the National Council on Environment (the highest policy making body on\n\nEnvironment) at the 15th Session in Year 2021 and the 17th session held in Year 2024 considered and approved the ban on Styrofoam and all other Single Use Plastics (SUPs).\n\nHe added that this position clearly vindicates the Lagos State Government on the decision to ban Styrofoam this year.\n\nHe explained that in a densely populated city like Lagos, the presence of plastic waste has brought about suffocation of the environment, endangering aquatic ecosystem and threatening human health daily.\n\nHe said the solutions to plastic pollution are as diverse as the problem itself, and require a multi-faceted approach that engages government, businesses, communities and individuals alike.\n\nHe added that It is not enough to simply recycle or clean up the mess but the root causes of plastic pollution must be addressed and all must fundamentally rethink the way these plastics are produced, consumed, and disposed.\n\nHe charged everyone to always remember that the fight against plastic pollution is not a sprint but a marathon adding that It will require patience, perseverance and a steadfast commitment to the shared goals.\n\n\"Our policy and advocacy efforts present a paradigm shift on Plastic Waste. We can no longer view it as a disposable commodity; rather, it must be regarded as resource demanding responsible stewardship. We cannot shy away from this responsibility; we must confront it head-on with resolve and determination\" he said.\n\nHe said to facilitate a smooth transition from a linear to a circular economy, the State government through the Ministry of Environment has developed a Plastic Waste Management Policy that will ensure an effective regulation and bring an end to the Plastic Waste menace.\n\nHe emphasised that residents cannot fold their arms and leave the solutions to posterity adding that everyone must seize the initiative to chart a new course which ensured plastic waste no longer constitute a scourge but a testament of our resilience and innovation.\n\nWahab maintained that \"we must demand accountability, hold ourselves, the industries and the government accountable for the plastic waste produced and the environmental damage it causes.\"\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Coca Cola Foundation and TechnoServe for their dedication, passion, and unwavering commitment to an environment free from the scourge of plastic pollution.", "source": {"uri": "theeagleonline.com.ng", "dataType": "news",

Despite the fortitude of countries within the High Ambition Coalition like Rwanda and Peru, negotiations on the agenda of intersessional work leading up to the final session in November in Busan, Korea, left the crucial aspect of reducing plastic production off the table.\n\nDivergence surrounding the root causes of plastic pollution was ignited by the overwhelming presence of the fossil fuel and chemical industry. And their impact was not hard to miss, with pro-plastic campaigners outside the Shaw Center where negotiations were held and nearly 200 lobbyists registering for the talks, even joining country delegations, according to a Center for International Environmental Law analysis. Their influence is far-reaching. Notably, the U.S., being the world's largest contributor to plastic waste, has not taken a stance on production.\n\nThe full plastic lifecycle -- from creation to waste -- represents an ocean justice crisis.\n\nI conveyed this message on Earth Day during a youth coalition meeting with U.S. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Welch (D-Vt.), and Representative Jared Huffman (D-Calif.). I advocated for the negotiators to prioritize increasing protections for human rights and ocean health by centering justice.\n\nDespite widespread discussions on the environmental and human health risks of plastics, there is still a noticeable gap in recognizing the interconnected injustices they perpetuate -- though the Global Youth Coalition on Plastic Pollution and Indigenous Peoples' Caucus were adamant about these connections in their plenary statements. While plastics impact everyone -- microplastics are in our air, food, water, soil, and bodies, even human placentas -- disproportionate negative impacts occur across race, occupation, ethnicity, class, gender, and age.\n\nOutside the plastics context, voices like Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson have brought justice to the forefront of ocean conservation, while Leah Thomas is the leading activist for Intersectional Environmentalism. As a Gen Z advocate deeply immersed in ocean advocacy, in my view, this is what the plastics conversation still needs: utilizing an intersectional approach to shed light on how the full plastic lifecycle -- from creation to waste -- represents an ocean justice crisis.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They pared down a lengthy draft of the text and agreed on a formal agenda for \"intersessional\" work ahead of the next -- and final -- meeting, in Busan, South Korea, scheduled for November 25. That work will involve critical issues around funding the treaty's provisions and identifying plastic-related chemicals that should be restricted.\n\nThe agenda, however, doesn't mention the elephant in the room: whether and how the treaty will limit plastic production.\n\n\"Nothing happened that was particularly surprising, but this outcome is still quite demoralizing,\" said Chris Dixon, an ocean campaign leader for the nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency who attended the talks. Other groups called the outcome \"disappointing\" and said the negotiations had been \"undermined by deep-rooted industry influence.\"\n\nDixon and other environmental advocates have spent the past three meetings fighting for a treaty that addresses the \"full life cycle\" of plastics -- meaning one that goes beyond waste management to limit the amount of plastic that's made in the first place.\n\nThe world already produces more than 400 million metric tons of plastic per year, and fossil fuel companies are planning to dramatically increase that number over the next few decades. Plastics have been described as the fossil fuel industry's \"plan B\" as the world pivots away from using oil and gas in transportation and electricity generation. This could have dire implications not only for plastic pollution but for the climate; according to a recent study, greenhouse gas emissions from growing plastic production could eat up one-fifth of the world's remaining carbon budget by 2050.\n\nJust because production limits aren't on the agenda for ad hoc working groups, however, doesn't mean they're out of the treaty; it just means delegates may arrive in Busan less prepared to discuss technical concepts related to plastics manufacturing. Language about the \"full life cycle\" of plastics is still in the treaty's mandate -- which countries agreed on in 2022 -- and throughout the draft text. Countries can also host unofficial discussions on the topic between now and November.\n\nThere's already widespread support for addressing plastic production in the treaty. Dozens of countries supported a statement presented by Rwanda and Peru last week saying that a global plastic reduction target should be \"a North Star\" for the treaty. The paper suggested reducing production by 40 percent below 2025 levels by 2040. Another declaration, published on Monday and signed by 28 countries, called for the treaty to \"achieve sustainable levels of production of primary plastic polymers.\"\n\nDixon said translating that support into binding treaty text is a matter of \"political commitment.\" On Monday, production was \"the first topic to get dropped\" as delegates scrambled to agree on an agenda for intersessional work, she said. They were trying to avoid a repeat of the previous conference, which ended with no agenda at all.\n\nSantos Virgilio, a delegate representing Angola, said during a panel on Monday that it is \"too early to say\" how his country and others will coax oil-producing states into accepting treaty provisions on plastic production. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar are among the countries most vociferously opposed to addressing plastic production as part of the treaty. Plastics industry lobbying groups also turned out in full force at the negotiating session to oppose production caps.\n\nChris Jahn, council secretary of the International Council of Chemical Associations, said in a statement on Monday that the industry is \"fully committed to a legally binding agreement all countries can join that ends plastic pollution without eliminating the massive societal benefits plastics provide for a healthier and more sustainable world.\"\n\nIndustry groups used the convening as a public relations opportunity, touting the benefits of plastic in ads placed throughout Ottawa. In a hotel, one collection of ads said plastics \"save lives,\" \"deliver water,\" and \"reduce food waste.\"\n\nThe United States has also resisted plastic production limits as part of the treaty. A State Department official told the Financial Times on Tuesday that \"overly prescriptive approaches\" could alienate \"major producers or consumers of plastics.\" Instead of cutting the supply of plastics, the U.S. wants to focus on reducing demand and improving infrastructure for recycling and reuse.\n\nDespite frustrations, several observers noted a promising shift in the tone at this week's negotiating session, compared to the previous meeting. \"There was a different energy, it was more collaborative,\" said Erin Simon, the vice president and head of plastic waste and business for the environmental nonprofit WWF. Bjorn Beeler, the general manager and international coordinator for the nonprofit International Pollutants Elimination Network, said it was \"very significant\" that the delegates were able to move from a 70-page \"zero draft\" of the treaty -- a laundry list of options meant to represent everybody's viewpoints -- to a more formal version that's been vetted by negotiators.\n\nAll of the most ambitious provisions of the treaty are still in the newly updated draft, Beeler said, meaning they're still up for discussion. He also noted growing support for health-related aspects of the treaty, particularly a provision to limit potentially dangerous chemicals that are commonly added to plastics. Delegates agreed to create an expert group to focus on this topic during intersessional work. They tasked it with proposing a framework to identify the most problematic types of plastic and plastic-related chemicals, as well as product designs that increase plastic products' recycling and reuse potential.\n\nAlthough countries disagree on whether certain substances should be banned or just restricted, and which criteria should be used to identify such substances, there is more convergence on regulating chemicals than on most other issues. Even Iraq, a major oil producer, submitted a statement supporting the creation of two lists of banned and restricted plastic chemicals.\n\n\"Everyone knows there are hazardous chemicals in plastics,\" Beeler said. Griffins Ochieng, the executive director of the Kenya-based Center for Environmental Justice and Development, said in a statement that a global plastics treaty that addresses chemicals in plastics \"is an impetus toward eradicating plastic pollution.\"\n\nOne other expert group will focus on finance -- where to get funding to help developing countries transition away from single-use plastics and test plastics for hazardous chemicals, among other treaty objectives, and how to distribute that money. Some countries and many environmental groups support the creation of a dedicated fund to help poor countries implement the provisions of the plastics treaty. Others say it would be simpler to use an existing mechanism like the Global Environmental Facility, a multilateral fund that provides grants to support government projects.\n\nWith eight months remaining in 2024, delegates have a lot of work ahead of them if they want to wrap up a treaty by the end of the year, which is the goal countries agreed on when they decided to write a treaty in March 2022. Even if the treaty does not take its most ambitious form, it could still have a big impact. Policies to disincentivize the use of virgin plastic, for instance -- like recycled content requirements -- are relatively noncontroversial, and they could indirectly limit plastic production. Beeler said it's also possible that new requirements on the measurement and disclosure of plastic production could eventually lead to production limits after the treaty is ratified.\n\nSimon, with WWF, said she feels cautiously hopeful following this week's meeting. The conference was \"not a failure, and definitely not a win.\" she said. \"But it is progress.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthdig.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthdig: Expert Reporting, Current

What You Need to Know", "body": "Recycling your plastics is a great way to help the environment, but you can't simply toss any water bottle or cellophane wrapper into the recycling bin -- some plastics are better off in the trash. And if you don't clean your recyclable plastics properly, they could end up contaminating other recyclables.\n\nPlastic that isn't recycled is either put in landfills or incinerated, or it finds its way into the oceans. Incinerating plastics produces carbon dioxide, which is responsible for the total energy imbalance causing the Earth's temperature to rise, according to NOAA Climate.gov. If placed in a landfill, plastic can take anywhere from five to 600 years to decompose, depending on what type it is. The average time it takes a plastic bottle to decompose is 450 years.\n\nHere's what the experts have to say about recycling plastics. For more information, here's which takeout containers are recyclable.\n\nRecycling plastic might be more difficult than you think. You need to rinse out any food and liquids (other than water) from the containers before you can put them in the bin. If the plastic isn't clean, a recycling center employee told CNET, it could contaminate an entire load of plastics, causing the recycling center to send the whole batch to a landfill.\n\nWhen recycling plastic bottles, check to see if they say \"crush to conserve\" on the label. If so, remove the lid and crush the bottle by twisting from the top and pressing it down. After it's crushed, place the lid back on the bottle so it can also be recycled.\n\nAll plastics are not equal. Many people toss all their plastics in the recycling bin without knowing if it's recyclable or not. If it's not an accepted plastic at the recycling center, the employees will toss it in the trash.\n\nSo how do you know which plastics are accepted? Contact your local recycling company to see if they accept them. Many recycling companies have additional information on their website for items that can and cannot be recycled. If your local disposal company provides your recycling bin, it may list the information on the bin's outside.\n\nPlastic containers will typically have numbers on the bottom that denote which kind of plastic it is. For example, #1 and #2 plastics are almost always recyclable, while #6 plastics aren't always accepted.

As a marine biology Ph.D. student at Liverpool University, I kept removing it, but the next day, there'd be more.\n\nI'm now a leading international expert on microplastics, a term I coined on May 7, 2004, to describe fragments of plastic measuring as small as a millionth of a meter. As I work to help reduce the grip of plastic pollution on our planet, the solutions are clear to me.\n\nRegulators, governments and citizens all urgently need to turn off the tide of plastic pollution at its source by reducing the production of plastics. But having just returned from the UN global plastics treaty negotiations in Ottawa, Canada, it's frustrating to see the lack of consensus among nations about how to address this global problem.\n\nDisturbed by the scale of the plastic contamination I first noticed on that beach in 1993, I felt compelled to act. I recruited students and the local community to help with the annual Marine Conservation Society's beach clean. We recorded what we found on printed templates.\n\nBack then, a new tool was just becoming available for data compilation: the Excel spreadsheet. The budding scientist within drove me to tabulate what we removed, based on the categories on the printed templates that included bottles, bags, rope and netting.\n\nSuddenly, it struck me that the most numerous items had no category. Fragments of larger plastic items, which appeared by far the most numerous were not being recorded. I got curious and wondered what the smallest plastic pieces on the shore were.\n\nWhen I began teaching a few years later, I challenged my students to find the smallest pieces of plastic on the beach. Looking among the sand grains, there they were -- tiny blue and red fibers and fragments.\n\nAn almost forensic journey ensued to confirm their identity. In collaboration with a polymer chemist, we confirmed the tiny fragments were common plastic polymers -- polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) -- that presumably formed via mechanical degradation and were accumulating as fragments smaller than the grains of sand themselves.\n\nI was hooked on discovering more about this new form of contamination. Working initially with postgraduate students at the University of Plymouth where I was lecturing, we found that these pieces were common on the shore and in seabed mud and we showed they were eaten by marine life.\n\nMost alarmingly, we used archived samples of plankton that had been collected decades previously to demonstrate that the abundance of microplastics had increased significantly since the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nI pulled together nearly a decade of this research into a one-page summary titled \"Lost at sea: where is all the plastic?\" That paper, published in the journal Science 20 years ago, was the first to use the term microplastics in this context. Within a couple of weeks, this became a worldwide news story.\n\nEveryone wanted to know whether microplastics were harmful. I set out to establish the wider distribution and determine whether they might be harmful to humans and wildlife.\n\nDespite huge media and policy interest, funding was a challenge. One anonymous reviewer commented that there will never be enough plastic in the oceans to cause the sort of harm Thompson wants to investigate.\n\nOver the years that followed, my team and I showed that microplastics were common on shorelines worldwide, they were abundant in the deep sea, in Arctic sea ice and in multiple species of fish. They weren't just polluting marine environments. They were present in rivers and snow from near the summit of Mount Everest. Everywhere we looked, we found evidence of microplastics.\n\nBy 2008, the term microplastic was highlighted by the EU's flagship marine strategy framework directive, a policy introduced to maintain clean, healthy, productive and resilient marine ecosystems. It stipulated that \"the quantities of plastic and microplastic should not cause harm in the marine environment.\"\n\nWe demonstrated that, if ingested, microplastics could transfer from the gut to the circulatory system of mussels and that nanoparticles could pass through the bodies of scallops within a matter of hours. We demonstrated the potential for chemical transfer to wildlife and confirmed that the presence of microplastics could have negative consequences, reducing the ability of organisms to put on weight.\n\nA UK parliamentary environmental audit committee requested a special report on microplastics in 2016. I was called to give evidence, and perhaps prompted by comments from my colleagues, MP Mary Creagh referred to me as the \"godfather of microplastics\" and so it entered the public record.\n\nThere are now thousands of studies on microplastics published by researchers worldwide. Policy interventions resulting from this work include the UK ban on plastic microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics, and EU legislation to prohibit intentional addition of microplastics to products which could prevent hundreds of thousands of metric tons of microplastics entering the environment.\n\nHowever, the largest source of microplastics is the fragmentation of larger items in the environment. So ultimately, we need to take action to reduce the production of a wider range of plastic products than just those containing microplastics.\n\nWithout action, plastic production could triple by 2060. Yet, some nations seem set on a path to increase production rather than reduce it.\n\nLast week, I was in Ottawa where 180 nations debated the content of the global plastic pollution treaty, a text that contains more than 60 references to microplastics.\n\nWhat can be done to halt this accumulation? Microplastics are almost impossible to remove. Even for larger items, clean up won't solve the problem. Novel materials such as biodegradable plastics may offer benefits in specific circumstances but won't solve plastic pollution.\n\nI left the negotiations with mixed emotions. Pleased that the scientific community had delivered sufficient hard evidence -- including some of my own research -- on plastic pollution to initiate the need for this global treaty. Saddened that 180 nations found it so hard to reach a consensus on the way forward. Negotiations failed to stipulate that independent scientists should even be included in formal expert working groups.\n\nLike many scientists who helped deliver the evidence of harm, it's immensely frustrating to potentially be sidelined from an international process that hopes to deliver solutions. It may be hard for some to swallow -- I saw one delegate holding a single-use plastic water bottle behind his back during negotiations. Contrary to the outcome of those midnight discussions in Ottawa, the focus must be on prevention by reducing global production of plastic polymers and ensuring any plastic items we do produce are essential, safe and sustainable.", "source": {"uri": "phys.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phys.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microplastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barnacle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seaweed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Plymouth", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Plymouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polymer chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_ice_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic ice pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plankton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polypropylene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polyethylene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2022/microplastics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540849", "eventUri": "eng-9540849", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2004-05-07", "textStart": 335, "textEnd": 346}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

but Indigenous communities who were sold on the idea have been left with a white elephant.\n\nLouise Hardman started Plastic Collective in 2016, wanting to design a system that turned the tonnes of plastic discarded in the ocean into a recyclable product.\n\nShe was concerned about the detrimental effects plastic has on marine wildlife and ecosystems.\n\nMs Hardman developed a 'shruder' machine, which takes plastic collected from beaches, rivers and other waterways, shreds it and extrudes it as pellets - a bit like a massive paper shredder for plastics.\n\nThe idea is that the pellets are then sold to companies making moulded recycled plastic items.\n\nSome of the problems are that there's already an abundance of higher-grade pellets available, which haven't been degraded as much by spending time in the water, with salt and sun - and that while it might be an environmentally sustainable idea, the economics aren't there yet.\n\nIt costs way more to produce than the product can be sold for.\n\nPlastic is an enormous environmental problem - of the seven billion tonnes of plastic waste generated globally so far, less than 10 per cent has been recycled, according to the United Nations environment program.\n\nEvery year 19-23 million tonnes of plastic waste leaks into the world's aquatic ecosystems, polluting lakes, rivers and oceans.\n\nThe same properties that make plastics so useful -- durability and resistance to degradation -- also make them nearly impossible for nature to completely break down.\n\nMost plastic items never fully disappear; they just break down into smaller and smaller pieces.\n\nThose microplastics can enter human and other animal bodies through inhalation and absorption.\n\nIt's difficult to recycle because there are so many different types of plastic with chemically diverse make-ups - and they can't be thrown in together.\n\nThat means any plastic recycling system has to first sort the waste by type and colour, which is labour-intensive.\n\nPlastic Collective first trialled their system in the islands of Bali and Borneo and in Indonesia.\n\nMs Hardman concedes it wasn't an overwhelming success - but says that was because they were too small.\n\nSo they began making a bigger modular system that could be installed in shipping containers - and the first project they worked on was with the Miimi Aboriginal Corporation in Bowraville on the NSW North Coast.\n\nThe project received a donation of $167,000 from the Gowings Whale Trust and a grant from the NSW Department of Primary Industries to support regional employment.\n\nThe idea was to create jobs on country, with Indigenous rangers collecting plastics, including oyster barrels, from waterways, sorting then shredding it into a marketable product.\n\nWhile Ms Hardman told AAP the project went \"quite well\", Miimi chief executive Trish Walker and Earthtrust director Janette Blainey, who was also involved, have a different story.\n\n\"I like the vision of a circular economy,\" Ms Walker said.\n\n\"I like that it involves community and especially teaching them at a young age to know the difference between plastics, which was what our rangers were doing, going into schools.\"\n\nAnd while Miimi did manage to sell some of its shredded plastic to WAW handplanes - a boutique surfing company that makes body-surfing aids, including some using 30 per cent marine recycled plastic - it wasn't anywhere close to enough to be sustainable and pay wages.\n\nSo the small Aboriginal company had to shelve the project but still has ongoing costs related to it.\n\n\"That was something that was discussed in selling us the project, Plastic Collective assured us that there was a market,\" Ms Blainey said.\n\n\"We're waiting for this, we've been bitten, so we're not engaging with people going forward until we know we can pay people to do the work.\"\n\nOne of the international organisations that installed the system, Reef Check Malaysia, also had problems with expectations not meeting reality.\n\nChief executive Julian Hyde told AAP that, with hindsight, the machine was probably too complex for the island location where it was placed and there was not enough support available to the local community on the island to enable them to move beyond small scale production.\n\n\"I still believe that the project, to use a machine to produce small scale tourism souvenirs out of ocean-avoided plastic is a good one; it is a concept that is working in other parts of Malaysia,\" he said.\n\n\"But you can't just install a machine and expect production (and marketing, and sales, and distribution) to follow automatically, so big lessons learned there.\n\n\"The machine is still in place; and still producing; but not in the large volumes that are really needed to generate meaningful incomes.\"\n\nMs Walker, too, said she hoped if other organisations were considering a similar project that they did their research thoroughly.\n\n\"Being sold on the premise of cleaning country, creating an enterprise that supports Aboriginal employment, it sounds great - but you just get sold on that idea,\" she said.\n\n\"And, of course, you're always going to be thinking about your people that are controlling their own lives in a business that they love.\"\n\nMs Hardman believes there is a market - but now says there needs to be more work with local government to engage with waste management and that she approached the mayor and councillors around Bowraville, but they knocked back her ideas.\n\n\"I think (the Miimi project) just fell short,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm sort of sitting back at the moment thinking 'how do I engage the counsellors to be more proactive in this process?'\n\n\"Because I think that's the missing link.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plastic recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental issues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquatic ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White elephant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borneo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borneo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540849", "eventUri": "eng-9540849", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Loves to cook. Eats death threats for breakfast.\n\nP&A Corporation, the company that runs Pacific Eco Laundry, Winners Hardware, CK Smoke House and other businesses on Saipan, will launch a plastic bottle recycling project.\n\nIn an interview over the weekend, P&A Corporation President Doyi Kim said for the start-up, they will set up a plastic collection facility in Lower Base. In six months, Kim said, \"we will determine the volume of the collected plastics, off-island shipping, and the overall recycling operations strategies and procedures.\"\n\nTheir main goal is environmental protection, Kim said.\n\nShe believes that recycling used plastic bottles will reduce the amount of the non-biodegradable wastes that end up at Marpi landfill. She said some of the garbage ends up on the beaches and endangers aquatic species.\n\n\"Unlike other materials, plastics are non-biodegradable. They take up to 1,000 years to break down, so when plastic is discarded, it builds up in the environment until it reaches a crisis point. This pollution chokes marine wildlife, damages soil and poisons groundwater, and can cause serious health impacts. Our project will help alleviate the burden on the disposal methods and reduce the environmental impact associated with plastic waste,\" Kim said.\n\nPlastic recycling, she added, encourages community involvement in environmental stewardship. \"We believe that this project will also promote a sense of responsibility and cooperation in managing waste,\" she said.\n\nEconomic goal\n\nKim said the plastic recycling project was conceptualized during a casual gathering with some of their Korean colleagues. She said the conversation steered to what has been happening to the CNMI economy, the impending closure of Hyatt and the lack of tourists, all of which have a domino effect on other businesses on island.\n\n\"The closure of hotels will impact dry cleaning and laundromat businesses,\" Kim noted.\n\nShe said Pacific Eco Laundry Inc. in San Antonio operates a commercial dry-cleaning business and 24-hour laundromats.\n\nThe detergents and dry-cleaning agents they use are imported from South Korea so the company has accumulated a lot of plastic bottles over the years.\n\nShe said they also noticed that their laundromats produce a high volume of plastic containers for detergents, fabric softener, bleach, beverages and other materials. These can be recycled, she added.\n\nKim said plastic recycling has been in existence since the 1970's in South Korea and other countries. South Korea aims to reduce plastic waste by 50% and recycle 70% of them by 2030, she added.\n\n\"Instead of discarding our plastic containers, we are planning to collect and export them to Korea for recycling,\" Kim said.\n\nShe noted that Saipan has two recycling facilities that deal with scrap metals and aluminum, but there is no similar facility for plastic bottles and containers.\n\n\"We plan to pioneer the plastic recycling project here in Saipan and support the CNMI government in protecting the island's environment,\" Kim said.\n\nCollaboration\n\nKim said P&A Corporation will collaborate with different local agencies, private businesses, community groups and residents. She said they will make a public announcement once the plastic collection procedures and compensation are in place.\n\nShe would like to emphasize that \"we will only collect and accept 'clean' plastics. Meaning, the plastics must be free of grease, grime or any kind of residue. Posters and signs indicating acceptable recyclable plastics will be posted at our facility.\"\n\nKim said P&A Corporation's long-term mission is to be a productive and contributing member of the Saipan community.\n\n\"We have participated and sponsored community projects such as the Saipan Mayor's Office beautification projects, the San Antonio basketball court renovation, the post-typhoon Yutu cleanup, Marpi Peace Memorial Park maintenance, and we also support various other community events,\" she said.\n\nP&A Corporation's plastic recycling project, she added, \"will offer numerous benefits to both the environment and the community such as reduction of waste, community involvement, protection of wildlife while generating revenue.\"\n\nKim said she is hoping that the CNMI government will support the project.\n\n\"Government support can be in the form of incentivizing and facilitating recycling efforts through grants and funding, tax incentives, or regulation that supports and promotes recycling. Any kind of support and assistance from our local government and the community will be a welcome encouragement for this project's success,\" Kim said.", "source": {"uri": "mvariety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marianas Variety News & Views"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emmanuel_t_erediano@mvariety.com", "name": "Emmanuel T.

On the other hand, plastic recyclers and innovative packaging companies such as Ganesh, EPL, Uflex and ITC, which can provide solutions for making plastic recyclable, develop products using post-consumer recycled material (PCR), and offer economical alternatives to plastics, will be the key beneficiaries of the roll-out of the new rules.\n\nIndia will implement the mandatory norms for the recycling and reuse of recycled content for producers, importers and brand-owners of plastic packaging in a phased manner from FY2025. The new rules are a part of the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2022 (PWM), which aim to boost secondary plastic markets by enacting new norms to create a circular plastic economy and address the rising concerns about plastic pollution.\n\nKotak sees Colgate and Nestle getting impacted the most among companies in its coverage as the regulations will have a higher impact on the food and oral care segment and products that require the use of transparent packaging which requires higher-quality of recycled plastic packaging material. This trades at a 40-50% premium to virgin plastic.\n\nThe packaging costs of companies in the consumer staples universe are in the range of 5-13% of their revenues with a high exposure to plastic given its unique value proposition.

It is part of UNICEF C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's country program to improve learning, encourage environmental action and empower women.\n\nSince the 2019 launch, 383 classrooms have been built using over 3,000 tons of plastic, providing 19,150 children with new school infrastructure. Thousands more children and teachers have been reached with additional education support.\n\nUNICEF USA has been supporting and following the project's progress for years. I recently traveled to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire as part of a partner delegation to learn more.\n\nHere are 10 things UNICEF learned while implementing this complex program:\n\n1. Green collection points prevent unsafe storage of plastic refuse.Collecting trash from a landfill is not the safest work; women were cleaning and storing plastic waste in their homes, creating health risks to themselves and their families. UNICEF and partners are establishing green collection points in strategic locations to make it easier and safer to clean and store the plastic.\n\n2. Private sector contributions are essential.The project needed at least 1,000 women to collect plastic trash to keep pace with the need. However, fewer than 200 women were recruited. As a solution, about 70 percent of the plastic waste is purchased from the private sector -- creating an incentive for local entrepreneurs and supporting the market for recycled plastic waste.\n\n3. Avoid competing for plastic bottles.Beverage companies already buy plastic bottles, so to avoid undermining or directly competing with that market, the UNICEF program focuses on non-PBA plastic waste. This practice allows women to work not only with UNICEF partner Conceptos Pl\u00e1sticos, a Colombian social enterprise that manufactures the recycled plastic bricks, but to also sell to other entities.\n\n4. Collectives prevent profiteering.Women were selling their plastic waste to middlemen -- who were buying at the very low price of 27 francs per kilo and then selling it on the private market for 500 francs per kilo. So UNICEF helped form a women's collective to negotiate better prices.\n\nNow the women collecting plastic for the program are able to sell it for 200 francs per kilo -- with half going to the women, and half going to the collective.\n\n5. A trained workforce is needed to streamline the process of building classrooms with the plastic bricks.UNICEF hosted trainings for engineers, construction workers and designers with an emphasis on training and employing women.\n\n6. Plastic bricks are not suitable for everything.Builders discovered that the plastic bricks were not suitable for bathrooms because their surface is too porous and too difficult to keep clean. The potential solution: cover existing plastic-brick bathrooms with plaster and use alternative materials to construct future facilities.\n\n7. Building classrooms is labor-intensive and doesn't play to UNICEF's strengths.Rather than overseeing the construction projects, UNICEF is pivoting to \"buying\" classroom building kits for others who have been trained to work with the new material to assemble.\n\n8. Plastic bricks can be used to build other things schools need.UNICEF has a prototype desk made from plastic bricks, a longer-term solution to the wooden desks students currently use. Plans are underway to put the prototype into production.\n\nWithout proper WASH facilities and support at home, kids can still get sick. UNICEF's education team has partnered with the UNICEF WASH team in Cote d'Ivoire to explore expanding community WASH programs in neighborhoods to reinforce healthy practices.\n\n10. Children laughing and learning in colorful classrooms is inspirational!In addition to the construction of classrooms, UNICEF is also working with its partners in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to ensure quality instruction and improve learning outcomes. In 2023, UNICEF USA donor support helped UNICEF purchase teaching and learning materials for 37 plastic brick schools, benefiting 12,210 children.\n\nClassroom furnishings were also provided to 111 primary school classrooms and 21 preschools, benefiting 6,600 children. And 492 teachers received training.\n\nWhen trying new approaches, flexible funding is essential to meet unanticipated challenges and allow the staff to pivot when needed.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ivory Coast"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ivory Coast"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_franc", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French franc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_bottle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic bottle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASH", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WASH"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaster"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66390ee4a412611153a844ed/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540849", "eventUri": "eng-9540849", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Wes Moore approved a $50.3 million emergency contract on Wednesday to pay a Swedish construction company that removed debris from the March collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\n\nWhile the work to remove debris from the federal channel in the Patapsco River was done by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Maryland entered into the emergency contract with Skanska USA Civil Southeast Inc. in April to remove debris from other channels that could then be used by salvage and commercial vessels after the collapse.\n\nAlso Read | Python Swallows Woman After Crushing Her to Death in Indonesia, Husband Kills Giant Snake to Retrieve Body; Chilling Details Emerge.\n\nSkanska was chosen because it had successfully demolished the existing Nice/Middleton Bridge across the Potomac River, according to state records. The company was considered qualified and equipped to perform similar operations that were needed expeditiously in the bridge collapse.\n\nMarshall Brown, speaking on behalf of the Laborers-Employers Cooperation and Education Trust in the Mid-Atlantic Region, spoke against the contract at a Board of Public Works meeting on Wednesday. He said Maryland had had time to consider numerous available contractors that could have been mobilized to do the work. He said the emergency no-bid contract went against a state procurement process that is designed to be fair, competitive and transparent.\n\nAlso Read | Delhi: PWD Minister Atishi Inspects Centralised Monsoon Control Room To Assess Waterlogging Situation in National Capital (See Pics and Video).\n\n\"This no-bid contract does not meet the standards,\" Brown said. \"For those reasons, we stand firmly against the approval of this contract.\"\n\nBut Bruce Gartner, executive director of the Maryland Transportation Authority, said the state's engineers used their best professional judgment in an emergency and chose a company that already was doing work in the state.\n\n\"They were somebody that was available in the proximity, and we had knowledge that they could follow state procurement law and be responsive to the situation at hand,\" said Gartner, who noted that the bridge collapse was \"one of the most significant emergencies we've ever had.\"\n\nProcuring the debris removal through competitive bidding would have delayed the removal by a minimum of eight months, according to board documents.\n\nAt the board meeting, Moore said much work remains to rebuild the bridge, which he described as crucial to Maryland's and the national economy.\n\n\"We need to get it rebuilt,\" Moore said. \"The Port of Baltimore is an essential artery for economic flow, economic activity across the country, and to put it simply, our focus on getting this done is not about nostalgia, it's about necessity.\"\n\nThe governor, a Democrat, thanked President Joe Biden's administration for including a 100% federal cost share for the rebuild in a supplemental budget to Congress last week. Moore said he has been working to build a bipartisan coalition for the rebuild.\n\nMaryland has estimated the cost of a new bridge to be between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. The state plans to build a new span by the fall of 2028.\n\nShortly after leaving the Port of Baltimore early on March 26, the cardo ship Dali lost power and propulsion and crashed into one of the bridge's supporting columns, causing its collapse and killing six construction workers.

The Maryland Transportation Authority is poised to award that contract later this summer.\n\nMoore applauded President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, both Democrats, for including a 100% federal cost share for the reconstruction of the bridge in the president's supplemental budget presented to Congress last Friday.\n\nMoore, who has been designated as a key Democrat in Biden's reelection campaign, has traveled the country in recent weeks to stump for the president.\n\nThe governor said he has met with \"hundreds of leaders in the White House and on Capitol Hill\" over the past week to discuss moving forward with Maryland's effort to move forward with its bridge recovery efforts.\n\n\"The Port of Baltimore is an essential artery for economic flow and economic activity across the country and, to put it simply, our focus on getting this done is not about nostalgia,\" Moore said. \"It's about necessity.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_treasurer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State treasurer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanska", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skanska"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Lierman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Lierman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Baltimore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port of Baltimore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Board_of_Public_Works", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Board of Public Works"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapsco_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patapsco River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treasurer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Corps of Engineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annapolis, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Annapolis, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereck_E._Davis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dereck E.

Wes Moore, has approved a $50.3 million emergency contract with Swedish construction firm Skanska USA to clear debris from the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. While speaking against the no-bid contract, Marshall Brown cited procurement fairness. Gov. Moore emphasized the necessity due to economic impacts.\n\nThe Maryland board, led by Gov. Wes Moore, has sanctioned a $50.3 million emergency contract to a Swedish construction firm, Skanska USA, for removing debris resultant from the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers managed debris removal from the federal channel in the Patapsco River, while Maryland inked an emergency pact with Skanska Inc. to clear other navigation channels. This clearance allows commercial and salvage vessels to operate post-collapse. Skanska, noted for successfully demolishing the Nice/Middleton Bridge across the Potomac River, was deemed apt for this urgent task.\n\nDuring a Board of Public Works meeting, Marshall Brown from the Laborers-Employers Cooperation and Education Trust in the Mid-Atlantic Region contested the contract, arguing Maryland had ample time to consider numerous competent contractors. According to him, the emergency no-bid contract undermines the state's fair, competitive, and transparent procurement process. However, Bruce Gartner, the Maryland Transportation Authority's executive director, defended the decision, stressing the engineers' expert judgment during the emergency. He noted that competitive bidding would have delayed debris clearance by at least eight months.\n\nGov. Wes Moore emphasized the bridge's critical role in Maryland's and the national economy, acknowledging the Biden administration's 100% federal cost share for reconstruction. Estimated between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, the new bridge project is targeted for completion by fall 2028.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanska", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Skanska"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marshall University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Potomac River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapsco_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patapsco River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Corps of Engineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Transportation_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Transportation Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mid-Atlantic (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Trick_Capturing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Trick Capturing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/03_07_2024_18_23_48_695117.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704516", "eventUri": "eng-9704516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

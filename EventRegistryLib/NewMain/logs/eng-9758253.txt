It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, medical and educational settings and faith-based care.\n\nThe inquiry detailed a litany of abuses in state and faith-based care peaking in the 1970s -- including rape, sterilisation and electric shocks.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nThose from the Indigenous M\u0101ori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.\n\nThe majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group comprising less than 20 per cent of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe scale of the abuse was \"unimaginable\", scrutiny of state and faith-run institutions lax and predators rarely faced repercussions, the report said.\n\nCivil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice.\n\nMany of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions,\" the report said.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family.\"\n\nThe report estimated the average lifetime cost of abuse to a survivor as $NZ857,000 ($770,000) -- a figure which includes the increased costs of day-to-day activities.\n\n\"The most important element is to recognise and acknowledge the survivors for the reality and the truth of their lives,\" said Tracey McIntosh, a sociologist at the University of Auckland.\n\nThe report's 138 recommendations included public apologies from New Zealand's government, as well as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who have previously condemned child abuse.\n\nIt endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nIt called for the government to set up a Care Safe Agency responsible for overseeing the industry, as well new legislation requiring mandatory reporting of suspected abuse -- including admissions made during religious confession.\n\nIt also recommended a review of compensation paid in previous child abuse cases -- including at the Lake Alice adolescent unit -- and additional compensation payments to families who have been cared for by survivors of abuse due to the intergenerational trauma they suffered.\n\nHowever, it did not clarify the amount of compensation available for survivors.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements.\n\nAs recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nMr Luxon said he believed the total compensation due to survivors could run into billions of dollars, but also did not specify the amount which would be made available to individuals.\n\nHe said it was too soon to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up abuses would lose their jobs.\n\n\"We're opening up the redress conversations and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he said.\n\nThe report's recommendations add to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nIn a statement, the Catholic Church of New Zealand said it was carefully reviewing the report and had previously acknowledged the abuse occurred.\n\n\"We will ensure that action follows our review of the inquiry's findings,\" the statement said.\n\nAs many as 42 per cent of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry.\n\nMany more were exploited or neglected, the report said.\n\nThe Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14 per cent of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nIn one recommendation, the inquiry's authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThey added little was known about \"the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors\".\n\nThe Anglican Church in New Zealand said in a statement, \"We acknowledge and take full responsibility for our failures to provide the safe, caring and nurturing environment those who have been in our care had a right to expect and to receive\".", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting

The inquiry detailed a litany of abuses in state and faith-based care, including rape, sterilisation and electric shocks, which peaked in the 1970s.\n\nThose from the Indigenous Maori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, the report found, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.\n\nCivil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice, the report added.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the State and faith-based institutions,\" the report said.\n\nIt made 138 recommendations, including calling for public apologies from New Zealand's government, as well as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, heads of the Catholic and Anglican churches respectively, who have previously condemned child abuse.\n\nIn a statement the Catholic Church of New Zealand said it was carefully reviewing the report.\n\n\"We will ensure that action follows our review of the inquiry's findings,\" the statement said, adding it had previously acknowledged the abuse occurred.\n\nA spokesperson for the Anglican Church in New Zealand did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPAYOUTS DUE\n\nThe report estimated the average lifetime cost to an abuse survivor, that is what New Zealanders would consider normal, day-to-day activities, was estimated in 2020 to be approximately NZ$857,000 per person, though the report did not make clear the amount of compensation available for survivors.\n\nLuxon said he believed the total compensation due to survivors could run into billions of dollars.\n\n\"We're opening up the redress conversations and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry also recommended payments to families who have been cared for by survivors of abuse due to the intergenerational trauma they suffered, as well as review of compensation paid in previous child abuse cases including at the Lake Alice adolescent unit.\n\n\"The most important element is to recognise and acknowledge the survivors for the reality and the truth of their lives,\" said Tracey McIntosh, a sociologist at the University of Auckland.\n\nThe report also called for the government to set up a Care Safe Agency responsible for overseeing the industry, as well new legislation including mandatory reporting of suspected abuse, including admissions made during religious confession.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType":

AP\n\nThe report by Royal Commission of Inquiry spoke to over 2,300 survivours of abuse in New Zealand, which has a population of 5.3 million. The inquiry detailed a litany of abuses in state and faith-based care, including rape, sterilisation and electric shocks, which peaked in the 1970s.\n\nThose from the Indigenous Maori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, the report found, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.\n\nCivil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice, the report added.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the State and faith-based institutions,\" the report said.\n\nIt made 138 recommendations, including calling for public apologies from New Zealand's government, as well as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, heads of the Catholic and Anglican churches respectively, who have previously condemned child abuse.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon speaks to supporters at a party event in Auckland. File/AP\n\nIn a statement the Catholic Church of New Zealand said it was carefully reviewing the report.\n\n\"We will ensure that action follows our review of the inquiry's findings,\" the statement said, adding it had previously acknowledged the abuse occurred.\n\nA spokesperson for the Anglican Church in New Zealand did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPayouts due\n\nThe report estimated the average lifetime cost to an abuse survivor, that is what New Zealanders would consider normal, day-to-day activities, was estimated in 2020 to be approximately NZ$857,000 ($511,200.50) per person, though the report did not make clear the amount of compensation available for survivors.\n\nLuxon said he believed the total compensation due to survivors could run into billions of dollars.\n\nFamily members of Gary Gerbes gather outside New Zealand's Parliament House in Wellington, New Zealand. Reuters\n\n\"We're opening up the redress conversations and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry also recommended payments to families who have been cared for by survivors of abuse due to the intergenerational trauma they suffered, as well as review of compensation paid in previous child abuse cases including at the Lake Alice adolescent unit.\n\n\"The most important element is to recognise and acknowledge the survivors for the reality and the truth of their lives,\" said Tracey McIntosh, a sociologist at the University of Auckland.\n\nThe report also called for the government to set up a Care Safe Agency responsible for overseeing the industry, as well new legislation including mandatory reporting of suspected abuse, including admissions made during religious confession.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon",

Those from the Indigenous Maori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, the report found, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.\n\nCivil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice, the report added. \"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions,\" it said.\n\nIt made 138 recommendations, including calling for public apologies from New Zealand's government, as well as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, heads of the Catholic and Anglican churches respectively, who have previously condemned child abuse. The Catholic Church in New Zealand said it was carefully reviewing the report.\n\nThe Anglican Church in New Zealand said in a statement: \"We acknowledge and take full responsibility for our failures to provide the safe, caring and nurturing environment those who have been in our care had a right to expect and to receive.\"\n\nGovernment expected to pay compensation\n\nThe findings of the report could leave the government facing billions of dollars in fresh compensation claims. The report said the average lifetime cost to an abuse survivor was estimated in 2020 to be approximately NZ$857,000 ($511,200.50) per person, though it did not make clear the amount of compensation available for survivors.\n\nLuxon said he believed the total compensation due to survivors could run into billions of dollars. \"We're opening up the redress conversations and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry also recommended payments to families who have been cared for by survivors of abuse due to the intergenerational trauma they suffered, as well as a review of compensation paid in previous child abuse cases including at the Lake Alice adolescent unit. It also called for the government to set up a Care Safe Agency responsible for overseeing the industry.\n\n(with input from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aveek_banerjee@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Aveek Banerjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revelation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sterilization (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church in New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church_in_Aotearoa,_New_Zealand_and_Polynesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop of Canterbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 37}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/luxon-1721894355.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 1017, "textEnd": 1028}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The inquiry's report detailed widespread abuses in both state and faith-based care settings, including sexual assault, sterilisation, and electric shocks, with the peak of these atrocities occurring in the 1970s.\n\nThe report highlighted that individuals from the Indigenous Maori community, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities, were particularly susceptible to abuse. Civil and faith leaders frequently attempted to conceal these abuses by relocating offenders and denying responsibility, resulting in many victims dying without receiving justice. \"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people, and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions,\" the report stated.\n\nThe commission made 138 recommendations, including public apologies from New Zealand's government, the Pope, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the leaders of the Catholic and Anglican churches, respectively. Both religious leaders have previously condemned child abuse. The report also called for the establishment of a Care Safe Agency to oversee the industry and the introduction of new legislation mandating the reporting of suspected abuse, including admissions made during religious confession.\n\nThe report estimated the average lifetime cost for an abuse survivor to be approximately NZ$857,000 (US$511,200), reflecting the impact on what New Zealanders would consider normal, day-to-day activities. However, the report did not specify the amount of compensation available for survivors. Luxon acknowledged that the total compensation due to survivors could amount to billions of dollars. \"We're opening up the redress conversations and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry also recommended payments to families affected by the intergenerational trauma of abuse and a review of compensation paid in previous child abuse cases, including those at the state-run Lake Alice adolescent unit. \"The most important element is to recognise and acknowledge the survivors for the reality and the truth of their lives,\" said Tracey McIntosh, a sociologist at the University of Auckland.", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revelation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Auckland", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Auckland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop of Canterbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(religion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confession (religion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sociology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.ptcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2c377b7cceffacc425addf8c23075f6d_1280X720.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 796, "textEnd": 807}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Luxon said on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, that it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation to abuse victims identified in a wide-ranging independent inquiry into the abuse of children and vulnerable adults in a blistering final report that the country's state agencies and churches failed to prevent, stop or admit the abuse of those they were supposed to look after.\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- New Zealand's independent inquiry into decades of abuse of children and vulnerable adults released a blistering final report Wednesday finding the country's state agencies and churches failed to prevent, stop or admit to the mistreatment of those in their care.\n\nThe scale of abuse was \"unimaginable\" with an estimated 200,000 people abused over seven decades, many of them M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people, the report said.\n\nIn response to the findings, New Zealand's government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950.\n\nBut Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to say how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe prime minister said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he was shocked by the findings. He said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\n\"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not,\" he said, noting \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country.\n\nThe findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, as nations struggle to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected.\n\nThe figures were likely higher. Complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using the country's M\u0101ori and English names.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" they wrote.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings. They stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse in public hearings. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying. Few have been enacted.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe government pledged to supply answers by years end about plans for redress.\n\nThe new recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis. The inquiry also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming streets and monuments dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was the widest-ranging ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group making up less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe report singled out churches, particularly the Catholic Church. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nOne recommendation urged an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that, while the remainder quantifies the survivor's suffering and lost opportunities.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation. Some accepted small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, the government rejected the need for such an inquiry, and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government takes the findings seriously: \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nThe episode was \"a nationwide intergenerational shame\" that was far from over, said Chris Hipkins, leader of New Zealand's main opposition party, Labour, which commissioned the inquiry while in power.\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party, said she did not accept that the government needed time to digest the report. \"What the hell has changed for us?\" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The enquiry detailed a litany of abuses in state and faith-based care, including rape, sterilisation and electric shocks, which peaked in the 1970s.\n\nThose from the Indigenous Maori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, the report found, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.\n\nCivil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice, the report added.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the State and faith-based institutions,\" the report said.\n\nIt made 138 recommendations, including calling for public apologies from New Zealand's government, as well as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, heads of the Catholic and Anglican churches respectively, who have previously condemned child abuse.\n\nIn a statement the Catholic Church in New Zealand said it was carefully reviewing the report.\n\n\"We will ensure that action follows our review of the enquiry's findings,\" the statement said, adding it had previously acknowledged the abuse occurred.\n\nThe Anglican Church in New Zealand said in a statement: \"We acknowledge and take full responsibility for our failures to provide the safe, caring and nurturing environment those who have been in our care had a right to expect and to receive\".\n\nThe report estimated the average lifetime cost to an abuse survivor, that is what New Zealanders would consider normal, day-to-day activities, was estimated in 2020 to be approximately NZ$857,000 ($$683,029) per person, though the report did not make clear the amount of compensation available for survivors.\n\nLuxon said he believed the total compensation due to survivors could run into billions of dollars.\n\n\"We're opening up the redress conversations and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he said.\n\nThe enquiry also recommended payments to families who have been cared for by survivors of abuse due to the intergenerational trauma they suffered, as well as review of compensation paid in previous child abuse cases including at the Lake Alice adolescent unit.\n\n\"The most important element is to recognise and acknowledge the survivors for the reality and the truth of their lives,\" said Tracey McIntosh, a sociologist at the University of Auckland.\n\nThe report also called for the government to set up a Care Safe Agency responsible for overseeing the industry, as well new legislation including mandatory reporting of suspected abuse, including admissions made during religious confession.", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AsiaOne"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Luxon said on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, that it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation to abuse victims identified in a wide-ranging independent inquiry into the abuse of children and vulnerable adults in a blistering final report that the country's state agencies and churches failed to prevent, stop or admit the abuse of those they were supposed to look after.\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- New Zealand's independent inquiry into decades of abuse of children and vulnerable adults released a blistering final report Wednesday finding the country's state agencies and churches failed to prevent, stop or admit to the mistreatment of those in their care.\n\nThe scale of abuse was \"unimaginable\" with an estimated 200,000 people abused over seven decades, many of them M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people, the report said.\n\nIn response to the findings, New Zealand's government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950.\n\nBut Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to say how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe prime minister said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he was shocked by the findings. He said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\n\"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not,\" he said, noting \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country.\n\nThe findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, as nations struggle to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected.\n\nThe figures were likely higher. Complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using the country's M\u0101ori and English names.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" they wrote.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings. They stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse in public hearings. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying. Few have been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged to supply answers by years end about plans for redress.\n\nThe new recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis. The inquiry also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming streets and monuments dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was the widest-ranging ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group making up less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe report singled out churches, particularly the Catholic Church. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nOne recommendation urged an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that, while the remainder quantifies the survivor's suffering and lost opportunities.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation. Some accepted small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, the government rejected the need for such an inquiry, and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government takes the findings seriously: \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nThe episode was \"a nationwide intergenerational shame\" that was far from over, said Chris Hipkins, leader of New Zealand's main opposition party, Labour, which commissioned the inquiry while in power.\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party, said she did not accept that the government needed time to digest the report. \"What the hell has changed for us?\" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Luxon said on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, that it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation to abuse victims identified in a wide-ranging independent inquiry into the abuse of children and vulnerable adults in a blistering final report that the country's state agencies and churches failed to prevent, stop or admit the abuse of those they were supposed to look after.\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- New Zealand's wide-ranging independent inquiry into the abuse of children and vulnerable adults in care over the span of five decades released a blistering final report Wednesday that found the country's state agencies and churches failed to prevent, stop or admit to the abuse of those they were supposed to look after -- even when they knew about it.\n\nThe scale of the abuse was \"unimaginable\" with an estimated 200,000 people abused in seven decades, the report said. Scrutiny of state and faith-run institutions was lax and predators rarely faced repercussions.\n\nIn response to the findings, New Zealand's government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950. But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher, though precise numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the M\u0101ori and English names for the country.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" read the 3,000-page report.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in New Zealand's Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged Wednesday to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.\n\nThe fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts. The inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was notable for its scale -- the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care, and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that cost, while the remainder quantifies the toll on the survivor of their pain, suffering, lost opportunities and early death.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, attended Parliament on Wednesday, where she told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government took the findings seriously.\n\n\"Announce the redress system as soon as possible,\" she said. \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nIn comments to reporters Wednesday ahead of the report's release, Luxon said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he had been shocked by the findings.\n\n\"New Zealanders just don't think this thing would happen, that abuse on this scale would ever happen in New Zealand,\" the prime minister said. \"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not.\"\n\nLuxon said that when survivors tried to speak up with \"horrific and harrowing\" stories of abuse, the people charged with protecting them \"turned a blind eye.\" The findings marked \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country, Luxon added.\n\nWhile he could not yet say which recommendations he would commit to enacting, he said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\nFollowing Luxon's speech, hundreds of survivors stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nKaren Chhour, a lawmaker for the libertarian ACT party who grew up in state care, told Parliament that New Zealand had \"tolerated rape and abuse of vulnerable people and the abuse of power\" for too long.\n\n\"It's time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside,\" said Chhour, whose party is a member of the governing bloc.\n\nChildren and vulnerable adults were \"devalued and dehumanized,\" said Chris Hipkins, leader of Labour -- New Zealand's main opposition party, which commissioned the inquiry while in power. The episode was \"a nationwide intergenerational shame\" that was far from over, he added.\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party, said she did not accept the government needed time to digest the report.\n\n\"What the hell has changed for us?\" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament on Wednesday, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care -- and current government crackdowns on gangs and youth offenders, many of whom spent time in care.\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nIn one recommendation, the inquiry's authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, adding that little was known about \"the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors.\"\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement Wednesday that they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The inquiry detailed a litany of abuses in state and faith-based care, including rape, sterilisation and electric shocks, which peaked in the 1970s.\n\nThose from the Indigenous Maori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, the report found, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.\n\nCivil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice, the report added.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the State and faith-based institutions,\" the report said.\n\nIt made 138 recommendations, including calling for public apologies from New Zealand's government, as well as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, heads of the Catholic and Anglican churches respectively, who have previously condemned child abuse.\n\nIn a statement the Catholic Church of New Zealand said it was carefully reviewing the report.\n\n\"We will ensure that action follows our review of the inquiry's findings,\" the statement said, adding it had previously acknowledged the abuse occurred.\n\nA spokesperson for the Anglican Church in New Zealand did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe report estimated the average lifetime cost to an abuse survivor, that is what New Zealanders would consider normal, day-to-day activities, was estimated in 2020 to be approximately NZ$857,000 ($511,200.50) per person, though the report did not make clear the amount of compensation available for survivors.\n\nLuxon said he believed the total compensation due to survivors could run into billions of dollars.\n\n\"We're opening up the redress conversations and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry also recommended payments to families who have been cared for by survivors of abuse due to the intergenerational trauma they suffered, as well as review of compensation paid in previous child abuse cases including at the Lake Alice adolescent unit.\n\n\"The most important element is to recognise and acknowledge the survivors for the reality and the truth of their lives,\" said Tracey McIntosh, a sociologist at the University of Auckland.\n\nThe report also called for the government to set up a Care Safe Agency responsible for overseeing the industry, as well new legislation including mandatory reporting of suspected abuse, including admissions made during religious confession.\n\n(Reporting by Lucy Craymer in Wellington and Alasdair Pal in Sydney;

Scrutiny of state and faith-run institutions was lax and predators rarely faced repercussions.\n\nIn response to the findings, New Zealand's government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950. But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher, though precise numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the M\u0101ori and English names for the country.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" read the 3,000-page report.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in New Zealand's Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged Wednesday to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.\n\nThe fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts. The inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was notable for its scale -- the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care, and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that cost, while the remainder quantifies the toll on the survivor of their pain, suffering, lost opportunities and early death.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements.

The inquiry detailed a litany of abuses in state and faith-based care, including rape, sterilisation and electric shocks, which peaked in the 1970s.\n\nThose from the Indigenous Maori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, the report found, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.\n\nCivil and faith leaders fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability, with many victims dying before seeing justice, the report added.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the State and faith-based institutions,\" the report said.\n\nIt made 138 recommendations, including calling for public apologies from New Zealand's government, as well as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, heads of the Catholic and Anglican churches respectively, who have previously condemned child abuse.\n\nIt also called for the government to set up a Care Safe Agency responsible for overseeing the industry, as well new legislation including mandatory reporting of suspected abuse, including admissions made during religious confession.\n\nThe report estimated the average lifetime cost to an abuse survivor, that is what New Zealanders would consider normal, day-to-day activities, was estimated in 2020 to be approximately NZ$857,000 ($511,200.50) per person, though the report did not make clear the amount of compensation available for survivors.\n\nLuxon said he believed the total compensation due to survivors could run into billions of dollars.\n\n\"We're opening up the redress conversations and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry also recommended payments to families who have been cared for by survivors of abuse due to the intergenerational trauma they suffered, as well as review of compensation paid in previous child abuse cases including at the state-run Lake Alice adolescent unit.\n\n\"The most important element is to recognise and acknowledge the survivors for the reality and the truth of their lives,\" said Tracey McIntosh, a sociologist at the University of Auckland.",

But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 1999 -- in a country which today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the reported said. The figures were likely higher and accurate numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the M\u0101ori and English names for the country.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" read the 3,000-page report.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in New Zealand's Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged Wednesday to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.\n\nThe fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts. The inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was notable for its scale. Those leading it said the investigation was the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, medical and educational settings, and faith-based care, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost to survivors in their lifetime was $857,000 NZ dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Those abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nIn comments to reporters Wednesday ahead of the report's release, Luxon, the Prime Minister, said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he had been shocked by the findings.\n\n\"New Zealanders just don't think this thing would happen, that abuse on this scale would ever happen in New Zealand,\" he said. \"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not.\"\n\nThe findings marked \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country, Luxon added.\n\nIt was the largest and most complex inquiry ever undertaken in New Zealand, he said, and he could not yet say which recommendations he would commit to enacting, though he did say the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\nIn Parliament on Wednesday, hundreds of survivors stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in emotional scenes following Luxon's speech.\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nIn one recommendation, the inquiry's authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, adding that little was known about \"the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors.\"", "source": {"uri": "beaumontenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beaumont

He said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\n\"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not,\" he said, noting \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country.\n\nThe findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, as nations struggle to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected.\n\nThe figures were likely higher. Complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using the country's M\u0101ori and English names.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" they wrote.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings. They stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse in public hearings. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying. Few have been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged to supply answers by years end about plans for redress.\n\nThe new recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis. The inquiry also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming streets and monuments dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was the widest-ranging ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group making up less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe report singled out churches, particularly the Catholic Church. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nOne recommendation urged an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that, while the remainder quantifies the survivor's suffering and lost opportunities.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation. Some accepted small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, the government rejected the need for such an inquiry, and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government takes the findings seriously: \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nThe episode was \"a nationwide intergenerational shame\" that was far from over, said Chris Hipkins, leader of New Zealand's main opposition party, Labour, which commissioned the inquiry while in power.\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party, said she did not accept that the government needed time to digest the report. \"What the hell has changed for us?\" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news",

Out of similar inquiries around the world, it had the widest scope.\n\nThe independent investigation was put in motion in 2018 to reveal the extent and ongoing impact of abuse within the institutions designed to protect children. It primarily covered the period from 1950 to 1999, but those who had suffered abuse after 1999 also gave testimony.\n\nThe final report, weighing 14kg, was made public on Wednesday, marking the culmination of over 100 days of public hearings, nearly 3,000 testimonies gathered and more than one million documents received in evidence.\n\nSurvivors gathered in parliament's public gallery to witness the report being tabled.\n\n\"The final report has taken six years, but for many of us, it has been a lifetime of trying to look for, and seek, redress,\" said Frances Tagaloa, who was sexually abused in Catholic-run institutions from the age of five.\n\nState care survivor Keith Wiffin described the report's release as \"monumental\".\n\n\"I've been advocating for 22 years, and for most of that 22 years it has been a fight,\" said Wiffin, who was placed in state care aged 11 and experienced ongoing sexual assault and psychological abuse.\n\n\"This report is for us - it's explaining to the country the impact this subject has had on us all.\"\n\nThe inquiry estimated that of the 655,000 people who went through care institutions since the 1950s, roughly 200,000 were abused. The true number of survivors could be much higher, it said.\n\nIt found sexual, physical and emotional abuse and neglect was widespread and systematic, resulting in significant trauma to the victims. Those who carried out the abuse included caregivers, religious leaders, social workers, and medical professionals.\n\nThe inquiry found children at Lake Alice Psychiatric hospital during the 1970s were subjected to torture through electric shocks and painful injections as punishment.\n\nThe report presented testimonies of survivors. It looked at the impact of abuse and neglect on individuals and their families, as well as communities and society.\n\n\"The care system in Aotearoa New Zealand was a fully funded failure that enabled pervasive abuse and neglect,\" the report said. \"Almost every survivor who came forward to share their experience with the inquiry has endured irreparable damage to the quality of their lives.\"\n\nIn some institutions, children experienced extreme abuse. There was evidence of young people being threatened with death through mock executions, experiencing severe corporal punishment inflicted with weapons to the genitals, and being routinely held in solitary confinement. The report also identified the overuse of institutional care for deaf, disabled and mentally distressed people.\n\nIt found many survivors subsequently experienced homelessness, poverty, addiction, devastating effects on health and mental health, and reduced opportunities for education and work. M\u0101ori survivors faced disconnection from their culture and identity, while some survivors were put on the pathway of gang membership, imprisonment, and suicide.\n\nThe inquiry estimated the total economic cost of this abuse and neglect at about $200bn.\n\nThe judge chairing the inquiry, Coral Shaw, described the scale of abuse as a \"national disgrace and shame\" and urged New Zealand to heed the report to ensure it never happens again.\n\n\"The people who were taken into care were babies, they were young children, they were young people, they were adults who needed care. They were taken under the guise of being supported and protected but instead they were abused and harmed,\" Shaw said.\n\nThe inquiry made 95 redress recommendations and 138 other recommendations, including calling for a formal apology from the prime minister, formal apologies from the pope and other heads of churches, renaming streets and amenities named after a proven perpetrator, and reopening criminal investigations into possible offending.\n\nIt recommended a new agency, the Care Safe Agency, be established to prevent and respond to abuse and neglect in care, supported by a new law to give effect to the agency and the inquiry's recommendations.\n\nIt made multiple, detailed recommendations over how state and faith-based care entities should ensure safety within their institutions, and called for better government investment in mental health and disability care.\n\nSurvivors detailed their hopes for the future, including a total overhaul of the system to ensure the \"national catastrophe\" of abuse was ended.\n\n\"The name of this report is named Whanaketia - through pain and trauma, from darkness to light,\" Wiffin said.\n\n\"The light is doing something meaningful, finally taking responsibility and focusing on transformation of the care system right now, because abuse is still happening at an unacceptable rate.\"\n\nTagaloa called on religious institutions to apologise, and said it was time the care of children was handed over to communities, iwi (tribes) and family networks, \"so the government is not the parent of our children\".\n\nThe report was a significant milestone, she said, but cautioned against complacency.\n\n\"This [report] is not the end, it is really just the beginning of what needs to happen so survivors to get significant redress.\"\n\nThe prime minister, Christopher Luxon, said the report marked a \"dark and sorrowful day\" in New Zealand's history.\n\n\"As a society and as a state, we should have done better, and I am determined to do so,\" he said, and thanked the survivors for their courageous testimonies.\n\n\"I can not take away your pain but I can tell you this: today you are heard and you are believed.\"\n\nThe state failed survivors in the \"worst possible way\" by subjecting those in its care to \"unimaginable physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse\", Luxon said.\n\nHe acknowledged the Lake Alice victims who were tortured.\n\n\"These experiences were nothing short of horrific and happened within the New Zealand health system within living memory.\"\n\nThe prime minister will make a formal public apology to the survivors later this year.\n\nThe minister in charge of the government's response to the inquiry, Erica Stanford, said the government would focus on redress in the first instance and carefully consider the other recommendations in due course, but today was about the survivors.\n\n\"Their bravery will not only correct the historical record, it will change our future.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eva_corlett@theguardian.com", "name": "Eva Corlett", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Scrutiny of state and faith-run institutions was lax and predators rarely faced repercussions.\n\nIn response to the findings, New Zealand's government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950. But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher, though precise numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the M\u0101ori and English names for the country.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" read the 3,000-page report.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery yesterday in New Zealand's Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged yesterday to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.\n\nThe fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts. The inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was notable for its scale -- the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care, and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found.

Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that cost, while the remainder quantifies the toll on the survivor of their pain, suffering, lost opportunities and early death.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, attended Parliament on Wednesday, where she told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government took the findings seriously.\n\n\"Announce the redress system as soon as possible,\" she said. \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nIn comments to reporters Wednesday ahead of the report's release, Luxon said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he had been shocked by the findings.\n\n\"New Zealanders just don't think this thing would happen, that abuse on this scale would ever happen in New Zealand,\" the prime minister said. \"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not.\"\n\nLuxon said that when survivors tried to speak up with \"horrific and harrowing\" stories of abuse, the people charged with protecting them \"turned a blind eye.\" The findings marked \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country, Luxon added.\n\nWhile he could not yet say which recommendations he would commit to enacting, he said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\nFollowing Luxon's speech, hundreds of survivors stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nKaren Chhour, a lawmaker for the libertarian ACT party who grew up in state care, told Parliament that New Zealand had \"tolerated rape and abuse of vulnerable people and the abuse of power\" for too long.\n\n\"It's time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside,\" said Chhour, whose party is a member of the governing bloc.\n\nChildren and vulnerable adults were \"devalued and dehumanized,\" said Chris Hipkins, leader of Labour -- New Zealand's main opposition party, which commissioned the inquiry while in power. The episode was \"a nationwide intergenerational shame\" that was far from over, he added.\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party, said she did not accept the government needed time to digest the report.\n\n\"What the hell has changed for us?\" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament on Wednesday, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care -- and current government crackdowns on gangs and youth offenders, many of whom spent time in care.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nIn one recommendation, the inquiry's authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, adding that little was known about \"the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors.\"\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement Wednesday that they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\n\"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not,\" he said, noting \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country.\n\nThe findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, as nations struggle to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected.\n\nThe figures were likely higher. Complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using the country's M\u0101ori and English names.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" they wrote.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings. They stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse in public hearings. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying. Few have been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged to supply answers by years end about plans for redress.\n\nThe new recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis. The inquiry also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming streets and monuments dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was the widest-ranging ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group making up less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe report singled out churches, particularly the Catholic Church. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nOne recommendation urged an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that, while the remainder quantifies the survivor's suffering and lost opportunities.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation. Some accepted small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, the government rejected the need for such an inquiry, and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government takes the findings seriously: \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nThe episode was \"a nationwide intergenerational shame\" that was far from over, said Chris Hipkins, leader of New Zealand's main opposition party, Labour, which commissioned the inquiry while in power.\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party, said she did not accept that the government needed time to digest the report. \"What the hell has changed for us?\" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care.\n\nCharlotte Graham-mclay, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri":

The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost to survivors in their lifetime was $857,000 NZ dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Those abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nIn comments to reporters Wednesday ahead of the report's release, Luxon, the Prime Minister, said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he had been shocked by the findings.\n\n\"New Zealanders just don't think this thing would happen, that abuse on this scale would ever happen in New Zealand,\" he said. \"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not.\"\n\nThe findings marked \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country, Luxon added.\n\nIt was the largest and most complex inquiry ever undertaken in New Zealand, he said, and he could not yet say which recommendations he would commit to enacting, though he did say the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\nIn Parliament on Wednesday, hundreds of survivors stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in emotional scenes following Luxon's speech.\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endemism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/ozLa7ORh_LR8UZIV6qBqakT-2rQ=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/WTWAV36D5GPRNWFPJJ44SKTLDM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 5319, "textEnd": 5326}], "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Scrutiny of state and faith-run institutions was lax and predators rarely faced repercussions.\n\nIn response to the findings, New Zealand's government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950. But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nLAWSUIT ALLEGES DECADES OF CHILD SEX ABUSE AT ILLINOIS JUVENILE DETENTION CENTERS STATEWIDE\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher, though precise numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the M\u0101ori and English names for the country.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" read the 3,000-page report.\n\nDOZENS OF CHILDREN WERE ABUSED IN PENNSYLVANIA'S JUVENILE FACILITIES, LAWSUITS ALLEGE\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in New Zealand's Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged Wednesday to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.\n\nThe fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts. The inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was notable for its scale -- the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care, and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is $508,000, the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that cost, while the remainder quantifies the toll on the survivor of their pain, suffering, lost opportunities and early death.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, attended Parliament on Wednesday, where she told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government took the findings seriously.\n\n\"Announce the redress system as soon as possible,\" she said. \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nIn comments to reporters Wednesday ahead of the report's release, Luxon said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he had been shocked by the findings.\n\n\"New Zealanders just don't think this thing would happen, that abuse on this scale would ever happen in New Zealand,\" the prime minister said. \"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not.\"\n\nLuxon said that when survivors tried to speak up with \"horrific and harrowing\" stories of abuse, the people charged with protecting them \"turned a blind eye.\" The findings marked \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country, Luxon added.\n\nWhile he could not yet say which recommendations he would commit to enacting, he said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\nFollowing Luxon's speech, hundreds of survivors stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nKaren Chhour, a lawmaker for the libertarian ACT party who grew up in state care, told Parliament that New Zealand had \"tolerated rape and abuse of vulnerable people and the abuse of power\" for too long.\n\n\"It's time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside,\" said Chhour, whose party is a member of the governing bloc.\n\nChildren and vulnerable adults were \"devalued and dehumanized,\" said Chris Hipkins, leader of Labour -- New Zealand's main opposition party, which commissioned the inquiry while in power. The episode was \"a nationwide intergenerational shame\" that was far from over, he added.\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party, said she did not accept the government needed time to digest the report.\n\n\"What the hell has changed for us?\" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament on Wednesday, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care -- and current government crackdowns on gangs and youth offenders, many of whom spent time in care.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nIn one recommendation, the inquiry's authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, adding that little was known about \"the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors.\"\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement Wednesday that they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to the report, nearly one in three children and vulnerable adults in care from 1950 to 2019 experienced some form of abuse, potentially leading the government to face billions of dollars in compensation claims.\n\n\"This is a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history as a society and as a state, we should have done better, and I am determined that we will do so,\" Luxon told a news conference. An official apology will follow on Nov. 12, he added.\n\nSurvivors and their supporters filled the public gallery of the country's parliament as the report was debated, with many singing an Indigenous Maori song about love and unity. The report, by the Royal Commission of Inquiry, detailed severe abuses in state and faith-based care, including rape, sterilization, and electric shocks, peaking in the 1970s. The Indigenous Maori community and individuals with disabilities were especially vulnerable.\n\nCivil and faith leaders attempted to cover up abuse and avoided culpability, the report noted. \"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people, and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the State and faith-based institutions,\" the report stated.\n\nThe report made 138 recommendations, including public apologies from New Zealand's government, as well as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Catholic Church of New Zealand is reviewing the report and a spokesperson for the Anglican Church did not immediately comment.\n\nLuxon mentioned that the total compensation for survivors could run into billions of dollars. Discussions on compensation are ongoing with survivor groups.

Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country which today has a population of just five million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse.\n\nMany more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher and accurate numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the Maori and English names for the country.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" read the 3,000-page report.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery on Wednesday in New Zealand's parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter.\n\nMany of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.\n\nThe fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts.\n\nThe inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was notable for its scale. Those leading it said the investigation was the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken.\n\nIt examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, medical and educational settings, and faith-based care, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were Maori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime was 857,000 New Zealand dollars (\u00a3395,000), the inquiry found. Less than a quarter comprised financial costs to the country through health care and other government-funded measures, while the remainder quantified the toll on the survivor of their pain, suffering, lost opportunities and early death.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements.\n\nAs recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, attended parliament on Wednesday, where she told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government took the findings seriously.\n\n\"Announce the redress system as soon as possible,\" she said. \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nKaren Chhour, a lawmaker for the libertarian ACT party who grew up in state care, told parliament that New Zealand had \"tolerated rape and abuse of vulnerable people and the abuse of power\" for too long.\n\n\"It's time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside,\" said Ms Chhour, whose party is a member of the governing bloc.\n\nChildren and vulnerable adults were \"devalued and dehumanised,\" said Chris Hipkins, leader of Labour -- New Zealand's main opposition party, which commissioned the inquiry while in power.\n\nThe episode was \"a nationwide inter-generational shame\" that was far from over, he added.\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry.\n\nThe Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nIn one recommendation, the inquiry's authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, adding that little was known about \"the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors.\"\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement on Wednesday that they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc",

Scrutiny of state and faith-run institutions was lax and predators rarely faced repercussions.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIn response to the findings, New Zealand's government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950. But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher, though precise numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the M\u0101ori and English names for the country.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" read the 3,000-page report.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in New Zealand's Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged Wednesday to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.\n\nThe fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts. The inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was notable for its scale -- the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care, and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that cost, while the remainder quantifies the toll on the survivor of their pain, suffering, lost opportunities and early death.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, attended Parliament on Wednesday, where she told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government took the findings seriously.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Announce the redress system as soon as possible,\" she said. \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nIn comments to reporters Wednesday ahead of the report's release, Luxon said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he had been shocked by the findings.\n\n\"New Zealanders just don't think this thing would happen, that abuse on this scale would ever happen in New Zealand,\" the prime minister said. \"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not.\"\n\nLuxon said that when survivors tried to speak up with \"horrific and harrowing\" stories of abuse, the people charged with protecting them \"turned a blind eye.\" The findings marked \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country, Luxon added.\n\nWhile he could not yet say which recommendations he would commit to enacting, he said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\nFollowing Luxon's speech, hundreds of survivors stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nKaren Chhour, a lawmaker for the libertarian ACT party who grew up in state care, told Parliament that New Zealand had \"tolerated rape and abuse of vulnerable people and the abuse of power\" for too long.\n\n\"It's time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside,\" said Chhour, whose party is a member of the governing bloc.\n\nChildren and vulnerable adults were \"devalued and dehumanized,\" said Chris Hipkins, leader of Labour -- New Zealand's main opposition party, which commissioned the inquiry while in power. The episode was \"a nationwide intergenerational shame\" that was far from over, he added.\n\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the M\u0101ori Party, said she did not accept the government needed time to digest the report.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"What the hell has changed for us?\" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament on Wednesday, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care -- and current government crackdowns on gangs and youth offenders, many of whom spent time in care.\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nIn one recommendation, the inquiry's authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, adding that little was known about \"the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors.\"\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement Wednesday that they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country which today has a population of just five million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse.\n\nMany more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher and accurate numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the Maori and English names for the country.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" read the 3,000-page report.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery on Wednesday in New Zealand's parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter.\n\nMany of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying -- of which little has been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.\n\nThe fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts.\n\nThe inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was notable for its scale. Those leading it said the investigation was the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken.\n\nIt examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, medical and educational settings, and faith-based care, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were Maori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime was 857,000 New Zealand dollars (\u00a3395,000), the inquiry found. Less than a quarter comprised financial costs to the country through health care and other government-funded measures, while the remainder quantified the toll on the survivor of their pain, suffering, lost opportunities and early death.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements.\n\nAs recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, attended parliament on Wednesday, where she told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government took the findings seriously.\n\n\"Announce the redress system as soon as possible,\" she said. \"Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.\"\n\nKaren Chhour, a lawmaker for the libertarian ACT party who grew up in state care, told parliament that New Zealand had \"tolerated rape and abuse of vulnerable people and the abuse of power\" for too long.\n\n\"It's time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside,\" said Ms Chhour, whose party is a member of the governing bloc.\n\nChildren and vulnerable adults were \"devalued and dehumanised,\" said Chris Hipkins, leader of Labour -- New Zealand's main opposition party, which commissioned the inquiry while in power.\n\nThe episode was \"a nationwide inter-generational shame\" that was far from over, he added.\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry.\n\nThe Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nIn one recommendation, the inquiry's authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, adding that little was known about \"the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors.\"\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement on Wednesday that they had received the report and \"will now read and review it

The report's conclusion that nearly one in three vulnerable adults and children in care from 1950 to 2019 suffered from abuse could expose the government to billions of dollars worth of new compensation claims.\n\nChristopher Luxon expressed, \"This is a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history as a society and as a state, we should have done better, and I am determined that we will do so. New Zealanders don't think this thing would happen, that abuse on this scale would ever happen in New Zealand. We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not,\" at a news conference. On 12th November, there will be a formal apology.\n\nThe Royal Commission of Inquiry into \"Abuse of Care\" spoke with over 2,300 survivors of abuse. Since concerns were ignored and documents lost or destroyed, the actual numbers were probably greater but would never be known. It was dubbed the most comprehensive investigation of its type (which lasted for six years) by those in charge of the probe. It assessed abuse in foster homes, state-run hospitals, educational and medical facilities, and faith-based healthcare. The investigation revealed a long list of mistreatment at public and religious facilities, including rape, grooming, sterilization and electric shock therapy, that peaked in the 1970s.\n\nChildren were taken from their homes in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. The bulk of criminal gang members and inmates in New Zealand are suspected to have spent time in care. Individuals belonging to the Indigenous M\u0101ori community and those with physical or mental problems were particularly susceptible to maltreatment. While the M\u0101ori population made up less than 20% of the total population of New Zealand during the period under study, they accounted for the majority of the children in care.\n\nAccording to the report, the scope of the abuse was \"unimaginable,\" governmental and religious institutions were not closely monitored and predators hardly ever faced consequences. Religious and civil officials battled to conceal abuse by transferring perpetrators to different places and assigning blame, causing many victims to pass away before receiving justice. Officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children despite many of the worst instances had long been known.\n\nThe report pointed out, \"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions. These gross violations occurred at the same time that Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country to grow up as a child in a loving family.\"\n\nIt stated, \"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family. If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever.\"\n\nA report created for inquiry revealed that up to 42% of people receiving care from faith-based organizations across all denominations had experienced abuse. It added that many more were taken advantage of or ignored. In a 2020 report to the commission, the Catholic Church noted that throughout the investigation, allegations had been made against 14% of its clergy in New Zealand.\n\nThe authors of the inquiry urged a probe of a Catholic order's priests who had been transferred to Papua New Guinea to avoid allegations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand. It was mentioned that not much was known about \"the needs of potential survivors or the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there.\" The Anglican Church in New Zealand released a statement: \"We acknowledge and take full responsibility for our failures to provide the safe, caring and nurturing environment those who have been in our care had a right to expect and to receive.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church of New Zealand also responded to the development and issued a statement acknowledging that it had previously admitted the abuse had occurred and was carefully evaluating the results.\"We will ensure that action follows our review of the inquiry's findings,\" the statement asserted.\n\nA public apology from the government of New Zealand and the leaders of the Catholic and Anglican churches, who have denounced child abuse in the past, were among the 138 recommendations outlined in the report. Furthermore, it demanded that the government enact new laws requiring the reporting of any suspicions of abuse, including confessions made during religious services, and establish a Care Safe Agency to supervise the sector.\n\nAlthough the report did not specify how much compensation was available for survivors, it estimated that in 2020, the average lifetime cost to an abuse survivor what New Zealanders would consider normal, day-to-day activities would be roughly NZ$857,000 ($511,200.50) per person. According to the prime minister, survivors may be entitled to compensation totalling billions of dollars. \"We're opening up the redress conversations, and we're going through that work with survivor groups,\" he highlighted but conveyed that it was premature to guarantee that officials who denied or covered up abuses would lose their positions.\n\nThe probe also suggested reviewing the compensation given in past child abuse instances, particularly at the state-run Lake Alice adolescent institution, and making payments to families who have been cared for by abuse survivors because of the intergenerational trauma they experienced. Notably, the governments of New Zealand denied the necessity of an investigation of this kind as recently as 2015, and official organisations maintained that the abuse had not been widespread.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church_in_Aotearoa,_New_Zealand_and_Polynesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electroconvulsive therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-700x400-2-3.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 267}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 1131, "textEnd": 1144}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

For others, the impacts of abuse are ongoing and compounding, making everyday activities and choices challenging,\" it added.\n\nMr Luxon said: \"We should have done better, and I am determined we will do so.\n\n\"To every person who took part, I say thank you for your exceptional strength, your incredible courage and your confronting honesty. Because of you, we know the truth about the abuse and trauma you have endured,\" he said, describing many of the stories as horrific and harrowing.\n\n\"I cannot take away your pain, but I can tell you this: you are heard and you are believed.\"\n\nHe added that it was too soon to reveal how much the government expected to pay victims in compensation. He said he would offer a formal apology on 12 November.\n\nAccording to the report, the economic cost of this abuse and neglect has been estimated to be anywhere from NZ$96bn to $217bn, taking into consideration negative outcomes including increased mental and physical healthcare costs, homelessness and crime.\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of care abuse survivors took part in a march to parliament before the inquiry was released.\n\nOne survivor called the report \"historic\".\n\n\"For decades they told us we made it up,\" Toni Jarvis told news agency Reuters. \"So this today is historic and it's an acknowledgement. It acknowledges all the survivors that have been courageous enough to share their stories.\"\n\nAcademic Dr Rawiri Waretini-Karena, who was a witness in the inquiry, had earlier spoken about the \"pipeline from state care to prison\".\n\n\"When I walked into the prison yard for the first time as a teenager, having never been there before - I already knew 80% of the men in there. We'd spent the last 11 years growing up together in state care,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for Radio New Zealand.\n\n\"That's when I knew there was a pipeline to prison; a pipeline that has spent decades sweeping up and funnelling M\u0101ori children from state care to prison.\"\n\nDr Waretini-Karena added that the Royal Commission's report acknowledged \"that whilst we are responsible for our actions, we are not responsible for the hidden mechanisms that operate within the environment we are born into, privileging one faction at the expense of the other\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/286465ed0384f85cfe460ed7b87e828b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 2381, "textEnd": 2392}], "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Of these, it estimated 200,000 were abused and even more were neglected.\n\nThe true number will never be known because some records were never created, were lost, or in some cases destroyed.\n\n\"Abuse and neglect were widespread throughout the inquiry period.\"\n\nThe abuse and neglect could not be justified by the standards of the day, or now, the report said.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions.\"\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family.\n\nThe commission was established in 2018, initially to look into abuse in state care, and later expanded its remit to include religious or \"faith-based\" organisations.\n\nThe final report is 2944 pages long in 16 volumes, the last of which is a 364-page book of stories from \"survivors\", the word used by the royal commission to describe the people who had been abused and neglected. The youngest person to give evidence was 14, the oldest was 87.\n\nThe report found fault with successive Government ministers and departments, and a range of religious organisations including the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, the Salvation Army and the Gloriavale religious community on the West Coast.\n\nEven the police were found to be at fault, for several failings, including the disproportionate representation of M\u0101ori in the justice system, negative treatment of Pacific peoples and disabled people, not following policies on the treatment of minors and using police cells to detain children and young people, sometimes for weeks.\n\nThe report called for official apologies and redress from the Government and the organisations responsible.\n\nIt said the apologies should be made by the global heads of the churches involved, including the Pope for the Catholic Church and the Archbishop of Canterbury for the Anglicans.\n\nPolice were asked to establish a specialist unit dedicated to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the abuse, and the inquiry also called for a review of the appropriateness of street names and public amenities named after a proven perpetrator.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon, who called it \"a dark and sorrowful day\" following the report's release, said the Government would make a formal apology on November 12.\n\nThe report found abuse across the spectrum of care settings from foster homes to large institutions, perpetrated by a wide range of people, including professionals and clinicians.\n\nThe abuse \"almost always\" started from the day a person was placed in care and often continued until they left. For some, this meant years or even decades of frequent abuse and neglect.\n\n\"For some, it was a lifetime; for others, it led to an unmarked grave.\"\n\nAnother recommendation called for an inquiry into these unmarked graves, evidence of which had been found at former psychiatric institutions across New Zealand, particularly at Porirua, Tokanui and Sunnyside Hospitals.\n\nThe report said children, young people and adults were regularly treated without compassion, wilfully neglected or denied basic necessities such as privacy, food and suitable clothing.\n\nM\u0101ori, who made up 44% of those who came forward during the inquiry phase, experienced harsher treatment in many settings, being \"degraded\" because of their ethnicity and skin colour.\n\nThey were denied access to practise tikanga or communicate in te reo, or to connect with their whakapapa, sometimes violently.\n\nPacific peoples also experienced racial abuse and cultural neglect. Deaf people and those with disabilities were subjected to targeted abuse and derogatory verbal abuse.\n\nThe report says physical abuse was prevalent across all settings, and staff often pitted children and young people against each other, encouraging peer-on-peer abuse.\n\n\"In some cases, staff went to extremes to inflict as much pain as possible using weapons and electric shocks.\"\n\nSexual abuse was commonplace in both state and faith-based settings.\n\nAbusers groomed children, young people and vulnerable adults into trusting them.\n\nThey also deceived other staff, volunteers and leaders into believing they were trustworthy, which meant survivors who tried to disclose abuse were disbelieved.\n\nMany survivors were sexually assaulted, raped and forced to perform sexual acts. Sexual abuse was used to punish and intimidate.\n\n\"In some cases, the inquiry was told abusers organised the sexual abuse of survivors by trafficking them to members of the public.\"\n\nThe report confirmed that the treatment of people at the former Lake Alice Hospital matched official definitions of torture. Photo / Mark Mitchell\n\nThe inquiry reiterated an earlier finding, previously reported, on the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit near Marton, which found the use of electric shocks and the drug paraldehyde as punishment met official definitions of torture.\n\nLuxon acknowledged the Lake Alice findings in his press conference today.\n\n\"I am sorry it has taken so long for this acknowledgement of torture,\" he said.\n\nThe Abused\n\nPeople were abused in care arrangements right across a spectrum, from state placements in foster care, through boys' homes and boot camps, schools run by religious organisations, to large-scale hospitals and institutions.\n\nThe abused and neglected ranged from babies left unattended in cots without human contact, to long-term adult patients in psychiatric care.\n\n\"Babies were at times left in cots, with no hugs, physical interaction or other expressions of care.\"\n\nMany survivors recounted extreme sexual and physical abuse they experienced as children and adolescents.\n\n\"It cannot be emphasised enough that many of the victims of abuse and neglect, including of serious abuse, were children,\" the report said.\n\n\"Children are vulnerable simply because of their age. Those in care were often extremely vulnerable because of the circumstances that led them to be in care. There was an even greater vulnerability for disabled children. Similar considerations apply in respect of disabled people more generally and adults in care.\"\n\nSuccessive Governments pursued policies of large-scale institutions for people with mental health issues, or with learning difficulties or disabilities.\n\nThe Kimberley Centre near Levin sometimes held over 750 people. Photo / NZME\n\nThe Kimberley Centre near Levin, which received a volume of its own in the report, sometimes housed more than 750 people.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1972, the number of beds in psychopaedic hospitals increased from 549 to 2017.\n\nA report in 1953 recommended large-scale residential institutions, which could accommodate 400 to 500 children from five years old, as the best model of care for children with learning disabilities. This was despite international best practice that identified community care as the best model, and opposition from parent groups.\n\nDeaf and disabled people were placed in institutions including psychopaedic and psychiatric hospitals, specialist wards in general hospitals, and education settings such as special schools and residential schools and occupational training centres.\n\nDisabled people were often identified as disabled at a young age. Social attitudes contributed to disabled people being considered less valuable than other people.\n\nFor M\u0101ori, this was further compounded by racism.\n\nThe people in care had diverse needs, but the report noted that they all needed support and caring, strong protective factors and safeguarding.\n\nMany survivors told the inquiry about the \"horrific\" abuse and neglect they experienced while in care and the lifelong impacts for them and their families and wh\u0101nau.\n\n\"For many survivors, the abuse and neglect they experienced in care resulted in serious and debilitating addictions, an inability to form stable or loving relationships, missed opportunities for educational and vocational achievement and feelings of a deep sense of shame or blame,\" the report said.\n\n\"For some, it set them on a pathway to imprisonment. The Inquiry has heard it led others to take their own lives.\"\n\nDr Rawiri Waretini-Karena, an academic who was in prison for 10 years after being convicted of murder as a teenager, is quoted in the report.\n\n\"I was 18 when I walked into the yard - never been to prison before,\" he said.\n\n\"I walked out into the yard and there were 50 men there. I knew 45 of them, that's because they were beside me in the social welfare homes, the family homes and the boys' homes.\n\n\"So that's when I realised there was a pipeline to prison process.\"\n\nThe Abusers\n\nThe report said there was no single identifiable \"bad apple\" type of abuser.\n\n\"Abusers were male, female, young, old, P\u0101keh\u0101, M\u0101ori, Pacific Peoples, people from other ethnic groups, leaders, respected members of communities, unskilled workers, caregivers, volunteers, educated professionals including teachers, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and medical staff.\"\n\n\"They were also religious leaders including bishops, priests, religious sisters, religious brothers, deacons, lay people.\n\n\"Abusers were single, married with children, heterosexual, homosexual and celibate people.\"\n\nMany held highly-skilled or senior positions. Some were charismatic leaders. Most were adults.\n\nMany survivors were afraid to disclose abuse because of the power adults had over them.\n\nAbusers were able to misuse the power, control and opportunity that came with their positions to perpetrate abuse and neglect, sometimes going undetected for long periods.\n\nPositions that allowed a high degree of unsupervised contact with, or control over, people in care provided the greatest opportunities for abuse - for example, positions in foster homes, boarding schools, institutions and residences.\n\nFoster parents similarly had almost total power and control over a foster child or young person's life.\n\nStaff and volunteers in school hostels or boarding facilities held positions that gave them considerable power and control over the daily routines of those in their care.\n\n\"Abusers were able to use these positions of power and control to carry out abuse and neglect, with high rates of sexual abuse in some settings,\" the report said.\n\nMedical professionals and healthcare workers had \"coercive\" statutory powers to place people in care (at times without consent), decide their treatment including using compulsory orders.\n\n\"Some people misused the power and control that came with these positions to inflict certain types of abuse and neglect.\"\n\nIn religious settings, abusers occupied a wide range of positions.\n\nMany of them benefited from the elevated moral authority and/or power attributed to people in religious roles - bishop, pastor, minister, brother, priest, elder or shepherd - but volunteers or lay people also assumed moral authority.\n\nIn these contexts, abuse occurred in a religious framework or used religious beliefs as justification.\n\nThe report said a higher proportion of people were abused in faith-based settings than in State care.\n\nDilworth School in Epsom, Auckland, was singled out as a place with one of the highest levels of sexual abuse reported. Photo / Dean Purcell\n\nThe highest reported levels of sexual abuse were at Dilworth School in Auckland (Anglican), Marylands School in Christchurch (Catholic) and \"at Catholic institutions in general\".\n\nData from the Catholic Church showed that among the diocesan clergy, there were 378 reports of abuse made against 182 individuals, constituting 14% of all diocesan clergy during the inquiry period.\n\nAmong male members of religious orders, 599 reports of abuse were made against 187 individuals, representing 8% of all male members of religious orders during the same period.\n\n\"Abusers lied, silenced survivors and manipulated others to avoid accountability,\" the report said.\n\n\"Many abusers were adept at hiding their abuse or avoiding accountability once concerns had been raised.\"\n\nAbusers would often take steps so that survivors who had disclosed abuse or neglect were not believed.\n\nMany abusers developed strong relationships with their colleagues, which worked in their favour when concerns were raised.\n\nOther abusers would use their positions to silence or prevent survivors from disclosing abuse or neglect, telling them they would not be believed.\n\nOthers bullied survivors, threatened further abuse and, in some instances, threatened to kill them or hurt members of their family if they told anyone.\n\nThere was also peer\u2011on\u2011peer abuse in care, where people were abused by others of a similar age or in the same care setting.\n\n\"In care settings, a culture of physical or sexual violence could be established through staff condoning or even encouraging peer-on-peer abuse between residents.\"\n\nIn the words of one man who had been at the Van Asch College for deaf students in Christchurch in 1979: \"The older boys would often act as a pack and they would target me.\"\n\n\"About three times, boarding staff saw this same group of boys target me, take my pants off and try to assault me. Every time, the staff just laughed and did nothing. They found it funny.\"\n\nRacism towards M\u0101ori\n\nAbout 44% of the people who came forward to the inquiry were M\u0101ori, 2.5 times the proportion of M\u0101ori in the general population.\n\nThe report said M\u0101ori survivors told the inquiry of the \"overt and targeted racism\" they endured.\n\nThis included cultural neglect and the deliberate stripping away of M\u0101ori survivors from their culture, language, and identity in both State and faith-based care.\n\nThose who were adopted were legally severed from their whakapapa.\n\n\"Cultural genocide as defined by international law is the systematic destruction of traditions, values, language, and other elements that make one group of people distinct from another,\" the report said.\n\n\"While the Inquiry has not found a particular policy that expresses cultural genocide as a goal or intention of the care system, M\u0101ori have been disproportionately targeted, removed from their culture and placed into care systems that have not prioritised or provided for their traditions, values, and language.\"\n\nThis had also disrupted the transmission of knowledge, tikanga, te reo and collective identity to younger generations.\n\nThe Inquiry agreed with a Waitangi Tribunal finding that Crown care policies had been dominated by efforts to assimilate M\u0101ori to the P\u0101keh\u0101 way, which it called \"the most fundamental and persuasive breach\" of te Tiriti o Waitangi and its principles.\n\n\"Care systems were part of the ongoing effect of colonisation,\" the report said.\n\nThe care system had a hostile attitude towards the use and retention of te reo M\u0101ori, and some survivors had their M\u0101ori names changed or were punished for speaking te reo M\u0101ori.\n\n\"M\u0101ori survivors suffered a range of abuse and neglect across care settings, including psychological, emotional, physical, sexual, cultural, educational, medical, and spiritual abuse and neglect, on top of the effects of colonisation and urbanisation.\"\n\nCase study: The Kimberley Centre\n\nThe Kimberley Hospital near Levin, later known as the Kimberley Centre, which sometimes housed more than 750 people, is one of a number of institutions with its own case study within the report.\n\nFor the 61 years from 1945 that the Kimberley Centre was open, the institution had a \"significantly harmful impact\" on the lives of many of the disabled people who lived there, the report said.\n\nMany disabled children, young people and adults were placed at the Kimberley Centre by their family, commonly on the advice of a medical practitioner, in the belief that it was the best place for them.\n\nSome were sent there by their family for respite care and others arrived through transfers or patient swaps with other institutions.\n\n\"Physical and sexual abuse of disabled children, young people and adults at the Kimberley Centre was pervasive and severe.\"\n\n\"Physical abuse by staff and peers was common and normalised at the Kimberley Centre.\n\n\"This was reflected by the 'Kimberley cringe' where survivors would cower and protect their head if they were approached quickly.\"\n\nStaff and other patients at the Kimberley Centre committed rape and severe sexual assaults involving intimidation and punishment on disabled children, young people and adults.\n\nYoung people were forced to abuse their peers.\n\n\"Some staff took payment from groups of external abusers to organise rapes targeting M\u0101ori and non-speaking disabled children and young people,\" the report said.\n\nMany disabled children, young people and adults were placed in seclusion, sometimes as punishment for their behaviour. Some were sedated in seclusion until they calmed down, which could take hours or days.\n\nOthers were locked into day rooms for long periods and overnight with the lights off because of understaffing, in breach of policy.\n\nNeglect was pervasive. Survivors experienced psychological and emotional neglect; physical, cultural, medical, nutritional and educational neglect.\n\nThe emotional and psychological needs of disabled babies, children, young people and adults were largely neglected - they were not hugged, cuddled, or loved.\n\nThere was little to do, with residents spending 80% of their time in no form of purposeful activity, and 70% of their time in their villas.\n\nNutritional practices were poor. Some disabled children, young people and adults reported that they lost weight, were not fed for long periods, and some were fed with unnecessary feeding tubes.\n\nTents where young people slept alongside supervisors at Whakapakari, a youth boot camp on Great Barrier Island. Photo / Living Pictures\n\nCase Study: Boot Camp\n\nYoung people were sent to the Whakapakari Youth Programme, or \"boot camp\", on Great Barrier Island between 1977 and 2004 to be \"straightened out\".\n\nInstead, their lives were ruined from the abuse they suffered there, the report said.\n\nOne P\u0101keh\u0101 survivor told the commission of a \"rape club\" culture when he attended Whakapakari in 1990.\n\nSometimes the abuse occurred after a firearm was brandished at the boys.\n\nThe programme was government-funded to use the environment and outdoor activities to supposedly deprogramme youth from drug abuse, develop self\u2011esteem and learn skills, M\u0101oritanga and gain confidence.\n\nThe geographically isolated \"boot camp\" had harsh conditions that emphasised survival skills, military-style discipline, subservience, self\u2011sufficiency and hard physical labour.\n\nThe young people sent there endured cruel and inhumane treatment.\n\nChildren and young people in the custody of the Director General of Social Welfare were sent there by social workers or sentenced by judges in the Youth Court.\n\nMany had significant emotional and psychological problems but were not assessed for their needs such as disability or neurodiversity.\n\nStaff estimated that 80% were M\u0101ori, 14% P\u0101keh\u0101, and 5% Pacific peoples.\n\nMost were male but some were female. They were mostly aged between 14 and 16 but some were as young as 12.\n\nThey were sent to the programme for between one and six months. Although the young person or their guardian's consent was required, this was not always obtained.\n\nChildren and young people were housed in substandard tents, with long drop toilets and little or no hot water for bathing.\n\nThe daily emphasis was on physically demanding work, such as chopping and moving firewood, hunting and gardening.\n\nSupervisors had guns, ostensibly for hunting, but these were also used to instil discipline and, at times, to facilitate sexual assault.\n\n\"Survivors described extreme psychological, physical and sexual abuse at Whakapakari causing severe mental and physical pain,\" the report said.\n\n\"They were also physically, educationally and medically neglected.\n\n\"There is evidence to suggest physical and sexual abuse were used as punishment as well as to intimidate.\n\n\"Instead of being rehabilitated, survivors suffered immense harm from their experiences there.\n\nThe State funded the programme until its closure in 2004 but failed to monitor it or to safeguard the children and young people in its care at Whakapakari.\n\nIn first-person testimony, one man described being forced to dig a grave and lie in it while a supervisor fired shots overhead. He also described being raped at the camp.\n\nThe commission said that research demonstrated that boot camps and other harsh \"short sharp shock\" interventions for youth are ineffective at reducing repeat offending.\n\nDepartment of Justice research in 1983 found that 71% of young people reoffended within 12 months of release.\n\nIn 1988, reconviction rates of young offenders in these settings were 92%.\n\n\"Survivors of Whakapakari suffer from long-term conditions such as PTSD and terror of meeting their abusers,\" the report said.\n\n\"Almost all have experienced drug and alcohol addiction and every one of the survivors has been in prison since they attended the programme. Some survivors remain there to this day.\"\n\nFormer Minister of Child, Youth and Family, Ruth Dyson, said of Whakapakari in 2017: \"A lot of government money was put into that programme and in the end it resulted in the State funding violence and abuse towards children and young people. That's how horrific it was.\"\n\nKohitere Boy's Training Centre in Levin turned out hundreds of disaffected boys who later formed themselves into gangs. Photo / RNZ\n\nCase Study: The 'Cauldron of Violence'\n\nThe Hokio School and the Kohitere Boys' Training Centre near Levin were among the most abusive of all social welfare residential boys' homes in New Zealand, the report said\n\nThe volume of the report dealing with these institutions, which contained mainly M\u0101ori, is headed \"a cauldron of violence\".\n\n\"Each had cultures of normalised and pervasive violence,\" the report said.\n\n\"Extreme physical abuse was routinely meted out by staff members to punish, contain and humiliate boys. Many survivors experienced severe corporal punishment from staff, sometimes inflicted with weapons and to the genitals.\"\n\nStaff also punished boys with extreme physical training and inhumane tasks, while assaulting them at the same time.\n\nSurvivors also experienced significant violence from other children.\n\nYounger or physically smaller boys, including the few P\u0101keh\u0101 boys, were often a target for abuse from other children and young people.\n\nStaff often condoned, encouraged or ignored peer\u2011on\u2011peer violence through a king\u2011pin system, including violent \"stomping\" initiations of new boys, who were then expected to do the same to others.\n\nSexual abuse was also pervasive. It was inflicted on survivors by staff members, occasional adult visitors, and other boys.\n\n\"One third of registered survivors from these institutions were groomed, sexually abused, or brutally raped by staff,\" the report said.\n\n\"Groups of older boys raped and sexually abused younger boys - one quarter of survivors described being sexually abused by their peers.\"\n\nSolitary confinement or seclusion was misused, and was often used to punish those who had tried to run away.\n\nSome survivors were kept for days, weeks and sometimes months in prison\u2011like solitary confinement as a punishment, and were physically and psychologically abused while in there.\n\nRacism and cultural abuse were normalised.\n\n\"Many survivors suffer from post\u2011traumatic stress disorder, nightmares, depression and suicidal ideation. Some have died by suicide.\n\n\"Many survivors had issues with drug and alcohol use and addiction later in life, and many committed offences connected to their addictions and trauma.\n\nMore than half of the survivors from these institutions who spoke to the Inquiry had been in prison at some point in their lives.\n\nOne survivor told the inquiry he was made to do physical training naked.\n\n\"This involved me running laps around the block, still completely naked,\" he said. \"Every 10th lap you would do push-ups in the middle of the yard. Every time I ran past Mrs [Staff Member], she would hit me with a metal hearth shovel.\"\n\nSome survivors intentionally committed offences sufficiently serious to ensure they would be discharged as a ward of the State, with borstal or prison seen as preferable to care.\n\n\"Hokio School and Kohitere Centre were places where gangs were formed,\" the report said.\n\nGang members attend a hearing of the Abuse in Care Royal Commission. Photo / Te Ao M\u0101ori News\n\nFeeding the gangs\n\nAccording to one survivor, Wiremu Waikari, who was abused in Hokio and Kohitere and later went on to borstal, these institutions turned out hundreds of young men who later became gang members.\n\n\"In the 1960s and 1970s, gangs in New Zealand really kicked off because the boys' homes were feeding them with disenfranchised young people who were not nurtured by M\u0101ori or the State,\" he told the inquiry.\n\n\"That is definitely where my time in State care pushed me, and hundreds of other unhappy M\u0101ori kids, who weren't sure of themselves in any world.\"\n\nWaikari later left the Mongrel Mob and trained to become a social worker.\n\nAnother survivor, Paora (Paul) Sweeney, who later became a prison counsellor, said New Zealand's gang problem began in the institutions.\n\n\"Kohitere was the start of it all. The gang problem in the country today comes from there.\n\n\"A lot of the boys from Kohitere were in the gangs with me later on,\" he said.\n\n\"They were mostly M\u0101ori ... It's called Kohitere Boys' Training Centre, but I don't know what they were training to do. Be gang members?\"\n\nThe inquiry agreed that Hokio School and Kohitere Centre were places where gangs were formed.\n\n\"The State placed children and young people who were already vulnerable in these places, allowed abuse and neglect to occur, and provided no assistance to survivors to work through the impacts of abuse, neglect and trauma.\"\n\n\"Instead, many survivors found protection, connection, support and understanding by joining gangs.\"\n\nGloriavale created a culture through its doctrines which allowed abuse to occur. Photo / Google Maps\n\nGloriavale\n\nForty-one former people who had been members of the Gloriavale community on the West Coast of the South Island gave evidence to the commission.\n\nThe report found that from Gloriavale's inception in 1969 through to the end of the Inquiry period, the community's senior leadership were at fault for allowing physical and sexual abuse to happen within their flock.\n\nThey failed to protect survivors, and to recognise the harm the abuse caused.\n\nThey responded to abuse allegations by \"seeking repentance from offenders and forgiveness from victims\", inappropriately dealing with perpetrators, allowing them to remain in the community and continuing to abuse.\n\nThe commission said Gloriavave handled abuse complaints internally, without involving external authorities such as the police or Oranga Tamariki.\n\nThey also created a culture through the community's doctrines that allowed abuse to occur.\n\n\"If someone made an allegation of sexual abuse against a male member of the community, the leaders did not let the rest of the community know, even if children are involved,\" former Gloriavale member Zion Pilgrim said.", "source": {"uri":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIn response to the findings, New Zealand's government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to say how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe prime minister said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he was shocked by the findings. He said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.\n\n\"We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we're not,\" he said, noting \"a dark and sorrowful day\" for the country.\n\nThe findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, as nations struggle to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 -- in a country that today has a population of 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe figures were likely higher. Complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using the country's M\u0101ori and English names.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,\" they wrote.\n\nHundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings. They stood and sang a M\u0101ori song in an emotional scene.\n\nThe report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse in public hearings. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were \"either oblivious or indifferent\" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and abusers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe inquiry made 138 recommendations across New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying. Few have been enacted.\n\nThe government pledged to supply answers by years end about plans for redress.\n\nThe new recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis. The inquiry also endorsed creating offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming streets and monuments dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.\n\nAmong investigations worldwide, New Zealand's inquiry was the widest-ranging ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.\n\nChildren were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand's criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.\n\nAs in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities. The majority of children in care were M\u0101ori, despite the group making up less than 20% of New Zealand's population during the period examined.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe report singled out churches, particularly the Catholic Church. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nOne recommendation urged an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSenior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement they had received the report and \"will now read and review it carefully.\"\n\nThe average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($508,000), the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that, while the remainder quantifies the survivor's suffering and lost opportunities.\n\nThose abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation. Some accepted small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, the government rejected the need for such an inquiry, and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.\n\nTu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, told The Associated

But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 1999 -- in a country which today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the reported said. The figures were likely higher and accurate numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\nLuxon said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@santamariatimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "charlotte_graham_mclay@santamariatimes.com", "name": "Charlotte GRAHAM-McLAY", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_adult", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable adult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/santamariatimes.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b9c888ca-59a2-11eb-a31f-0b4d74fa96dc.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 2294, "textEnd": 2301}], "sentiment": -0.8196078431372549, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Of these, it estimated 200,000 were abused and even more were neglected.\n\nThe true number will never be known because some records were never created, were lost or, in some cases, destroyed.\n\n\"Abuse and neglect were widespread throughout the inquiry period.\"\n\nThe abuse and neglect could not be justified by the standards of the day, or now, the report said.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions.\"\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family.\n\nThe commission was established in 2018, initially to look into abuse in state care, and later expanded its remit to include religious or \"faith-based\" organisations.\n\nThe final report is 2944 pages long in 16 volumes, the last of which is a 364-page book of stories from \"survivors\", the word used by the royal commission to describe the people who had been abused and neglected. The youngest person to give evidence was 14, the oldest was 87.\n\nEven the police were found to be at fault, for several failings, including the disproportionate representation of M\u0101ori in the justice system, negative treatment of Pacific peoples and disabled people, not following policies on the treatment of minors and using police cells to detain children and young people, sometimes for weeks.\n\nThe report called for official apologies and redress from the Government and the organisations responsible.\n\nPolice were asked to establish a specialist unit dedicated to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the abuse, and the inquiry also called for a review of the appropriateness of street names and public amenities named after a proven perpetrator.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon, who called it \"a dark and sorrowful day\" following the report's release, said the Government would make a formal apology on November 12.\n\nThe report found abuse across the spectrum of care settings, from foster homes to large institutions, and perpetrated by a wide range of people, including professionals and clinicians.\n\n\"For some, it was a lifetime; for others, it led to an unmarked grave.\"\n\nAnother recommendation called for an inquiry into these unmarked graves, evidence of which had been found at former psychiatric institutions across New Zealand, particularly at Porirua, Tokanui and Sunnyside Hospitals.\n\nThe report said children, young people and adults were regularly treated without compassion, wilfully neglected or denied basic necessities such as privacy, food and suitable clothing.\n\nM\u0101ori, who made up 44% of those who came forward during the inquiry phase, experienced harsher treatment in many settings, being \"degraded\" because of their ethnicity and skin colour.\n\nPacific peoples also experienced racial abuse and cultural neglect. Deaf people and those with disabilities were subjected to targeted abuse and derogatory verbal abuse.\n\nThe report says physical abuse was prevalent across all settings, and staff often pitted children and young people against each other, encouraging peer-on-peer abuse.\n\n\"In some cases, staff went to extremes to inflict as much pain as possible using weapons and electric shocks.\"\n\nSexual abuse was commonplace in both state and faith-based settings.\n\nAbusers groomed children, young people and vulnerable adults into trusting them.\n\nThey also deceived other staff, volunteers and leaders into believing they were trustworthy, which meant survivors who tried to disclose abuse were disbelieved.\n\nMany survivors were sexually assaulted, raped and forced to perform sexual acts. Sexual abuse was used to punish and intimidate.\n\n\"In some cases, the inquiry was told abusers organised the sexual abuse of survivors by trafficking them to members of the public.\"\n\nThe inquiry reiterated an earlier finding, previously reported, on the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit near Marton, which found the use of electric shocks and the drug paraldehyde as punishment met official definitions of torture.\n\nLuxon acknowledged the Lake Alice findings in his press conference today.\n\n\"I am sorry it has taken so long for this acknowledgement of torture,\" he said.\n\nPeople were abused in care arrangements right across a spectrum, from state placements in foster care, through boys' homes and boot camps, schools run by religious organisations, to large-scale hospitals and institutions.\n\nThe abused and neglected ranged from babies left unattended in cots without human contact, to long-term adult patients in psychiatric care.\n\n\"Babies were at times left in cots, with no hugs, physical interaction or other expressions of care.\"\n\nMany survivors recounted extreme sexual and physical abuse they experienced as children and adolescents.\n\n\"It cannot be emphasised enough that many of the victims of abuse and neglect, including of serious abuse, were children,\" the report said.\n\n\"Children are vulnerable simply because of their age. Those in care were often extremely vulnerable because of the circumstances that led them to be in care. There was an even greater vulnerability for disabled children. Similar considerations apply in respect of disabled people more generally and adults in care.\"\n\nSuccessive Governments pursued policies of large-scale institutions for people with mental health issues, or with learning difficulties or disabilities.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1972, the number of beds in psychopaedic hospitals increased from 549 to 2017.\n\nA report in 1953 recommended large-scale residential institutions, which could accommodate 400 to 500 children from 5 years old, as the best model of care for children with learning disabilities. This was despite international best practice that identified community care as the best model, and opposition from parent groups.\n\nDeaf and disabled people were placed in institutions including psychopaedic and psychiatric hospitals, specialist wards in general hospitals, and education settings such as special schools and residential schools and occupational training centres.\n\nDisabled people were often identified as disabled at a young age. Social attitudes contributed to disabled people being considered less valuable than other people.\n\nFor M\u0101ori, this was further compounded by racism.\n\nThe people in care had diverse needs, but the report noted that they all needed support and caring, strong protective factors and safeguarding.\n\nMany survivors told the inquiry about the \"horrific\" abuse and neglect they experienced while in care and the lifelong impacts for them and their families and wh\u0101nau.\n\n\"For many survivors, the abuse and neglect they experienced in care resulted in serious and debilitating addictions, an inability to form stable or loving relationships, missed opportunities for educational and vocational achievement and feelings of a deep sense of shame or blame,\" the report said.\n\n\"For some, it set them on a pathway to imprisonment. The inquiry has heard it led others to take their own lives.\"\n\nDr Rawiri Waretini-Karena, an academic who was in prison for 10 years after being convicted of murder as a teenager, is quoted in the report.\n\n\"I was 18 when I walked into the yard - never been to prison before,\" he said.\n\n\"I walked out into the yard and there were 50 men there. I knew 45 of them; that's because they were beside me in the social welfare homes, the family homes and the boys' homes.\n\n\"So that's when I realised there was a pipeline to prison process.\"\n\nThe report said there was no single identifiable \"bad apple\" type of abuser.\n\n\"Abusers were male, female, young, old, P\u0101keh\u0101, M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples, people from other ethnic groups, leaders, respected members of communities, unskilled workers, caregivers, volunteers, educated professionals including teachers, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and medical staff.\"\n\n\"They were also religious leaders including bishops, priests, religious sisters, religious brothers, deacons, lay people.\n\n\"Abusers were single, married with children, heterosexual, homosexual and celibate people.\"\n\nMany held highly-skilled or senior positions. Some were charismatic leaders. Most were adults.\n\nMany survivors were afraid to disclose abuse because of the power adults had over them.\n\nAbusers were able to misuse the power, control and opportunity that came with their positions to perpetrate abuse and neglect, sometimes going undetected for long periods.\n\nFoster parents similarly had almost total power and control over a foster child or young person's life.\n\nStaff and volunteers in school hostels or boarding facilities held positions that gave them considerable power and control over the daily routines of those in their care.\n\n\"Abusers were able to use these positions of power and control to carry out abuse and neglect, with high rates of sexual abuse in some settings,\" the report said.\n\nMedical professionals and healthcare workers had \"coercive\" statutory powers to place people in care (at times without consent), decide their treatment including using compulsory orders.\n\n\"Some people misused the power and control that came with these positions to inflict certain types of abuse and neglect.\"\n\nIn religious settings, abusers occupied a wide range of positions.\n\nMany of them benefited from the elevated moral authority and/or power attributed to people in religious roles - bishop, pastor, minister, brother, priest, elder or shepherd - but volunteers or lay people also assumed moral authority.\n\nIn these contexts, abuse occurred in a religious framework or used religious beliefs as justification.\n\nThe report said a higher proportion of people were abused in faith-based settings than in state care.\n\nThe highest reported levels of sexual abuse were at Dilworth School in Auckland (Anglican), Marylands School in Christchurch (Catholic) and \"at Catholic institutions in general\".\n\nData from the Catholic Church showed that among the diocesan clergy, there were 378 reports of abuse made against 182 individuals, constituting 14% of all diocesan clergy during the inquiry period.\n\nAmong male members of religious orders, 599 reports of abuse were made against 187 individuals, representing 8% of all male members of religious orders during the same period.\n\n\"Abusers lied, silenced survivors and manipulated others to avoid accountability,\" the report said.\n\n\"Many abusers were adept at hiding their abuse or avoiding accountability once concerns had been raised.\"\n\nAbusers would often take steps so that survivors who had disclosed abuse or neglect were not believed.\n\nMany abusers developed strong relationships with their colleagues, which worked in their favour when concerns were raised.\n\nOther abusers would use their positions to silence or prevent survivors from disclosing abuse or neglect, telling them they would not be believed.\n\nOthers bullied survivors, threatened further abuse and, in some instances, threatened to kill them or hurt members of their family if they told anyone.\n\nThere was also peer\u2011on\u2011peer abuse in care, where people were abused by others of a similar age or in the same care setting.\n\n\"In care settings, a culture of physical or sexual violence could be established through staff condoning or even encouraging peer-on-peer abuse between residents.\"\n\nIn the words of one man who had been at the Van Asch College for deaf students in Christchurch in 1979: \"The older boys would often act as a pack and they would target me.\"\n\n\"About three times, boarding staff saw this same group of boys target me, take my pants off and try to assault me. Every time, the staff just laughed and did nothing. They found it funny.\"\n\nAbout 44% of the people who came forward to the inquiry were M\u0101ori, 2.5 times the proportion of M\u0101ori in the general population.\n\nThe report said M\u0101ori survivors told the inquiry of the \"overt and targeted racism\" they endured.\n\nThis included cultural neglect and the deliberate stripping away of M\u0101ori survivors from their culture, language, and identity in both State and faith-based care.\n\nThose who were adopted were legally severed from their whakapapa.\n\n\"Cultural genocide as defined by international law is the systematic destruction of traditions, values, language, and other elements that make one group of people distinct from another,\" the report said.\n\n\"While the inquiry has not found a particular policy that expresses cultural genocide as a goal or intention of the care system, M\u0101ori have been disproportionately targeted, removed from their culture and placed into care systems that have not prioritised or provided for their traditions, values, and language.\"\n\nThis had also disrupted the transmission of knowledge, tikanga, te reo and collective identity to younger generations.\n\nThe inquiry agreed with a Waitangi Tribunal finding that Crown care policies had been dominated by efforts to assimilate M\u0101ori to the P\u0101keh\u0101 way, which it called \"the most fundamental and persuasive breach\" of te Tiriti o Waitangi and its principles.\n\n\"Care systems were part of the ongoing effect of colonisation,\" the report said.\n\nThe care system had a hostile attitude towards the use and retention of te reo M\u0101ori, and some survivors had their M\u0101ori names changed or were punished for speaking te reo M\u0101ori.\n\n\"M\u0101ori survivors suffered a range of abuse and neglect across care settings, including psychological, emotional, physical, sexual, cultural, educational, medical, and spiritual abuse and neglect, on top of the effects of colonisation and urbanisation.\"\n\nThe Kimberley Hospital near Levin, later known as the Kimberley Centre, which sometimes housed more than 750 people, is one of a number of institutions with its own case study within the report.\n\nFor the 61 years from 1945 that the Kimberley Centre was open, the institution had a \"significantly harmful impact\" on the lives of many of the disabled people who lived there, the report said.\n\nMany disabled children, young people and adults were placed at the Kimberley Centre by their family, commonly on the advice of a medical practitioner, in the belief that it was the best place for them.\n\nSome were sent there by their family for respite care and others arrived through transfers or patient swaps with other institutions.\n\n\"Physical and sexual abuse of disabled children, young people and adults at the Kimberley Centre was pervasive and severe.\"\n\n\"Physical abuse by staff and peers was common and normalised at the Kimberley Centre.\n\n\"This was reflected by the 'Kimberley cringe' where survivors would cower and protect their head if they were approached quickly.\"\n\nStaff and other patients at the Kimberley Centre committed rape and severe sexual assaults involving intimidation and punishment on disabled children, young people and adults.\n\nYoung people were forced to abuse their peers.\n\n\"Some staff took payment from groups of external abusers to organise rapes targeting M\u0101ori and non-speaking disabled children and young people,\" the report said.\n\nMany disabled children, young people and adults were placed in seclusion, sometimes as punishment for their behaviour. Some were sedated in seclusion until they calmed down, which could take hours or days.\n\nOthers were locked into day rooms for long periods and overnight with the lights off because of understaffing, in breach of policy.\n\nNeglect was pervasive. Survivors experienced psychological and emotional neglect; physical, cultural, medical, nutritional and educational neglect.\n\nThe emotional and psychological needs of disabled babies, children, young people and adults were largely neglected - they were not hugged, cuddled, or loved.\n\nThere was little to do, with residents spending 80% of their time in no form of purposeful activity, and 70% of their time in their villas.\n\nNutritional practices were poor. Some disabled children, young people and adults reported that they lost weight, were not fed for long periods, and some were fed with unnecessary feeding tubes.\n\nYoung people were sent to the Whakapakari Youth Programme, or \"boot camp\", on Great Barrier Island between 1977 and 2004 to be \"straightened out\".\n\nInstead, their lives were ruined from the abuse they suffered there, the report said.\n\nSometimes the abuse occurred after a firearm was brandished at the boys.\n\nThe programme was government-funded to use the environment and outdoor activities to supposedly deprogramme youth from drug abuse, develop self\u2011esteem and learn skills, M\u0101oritanga and gain confidence.\n\nThe geographically isolated \"boot camp\" had harsh conditions that emphasised survival skills, military-style discipline, subservience, self\u2011sufficiency and hard physical labour.\n\nThe young people sent there endured cruel and inhumane treatment.\n\nChildren and young people in the custody of the Director General of Social Welfare were sent there by social workers or sentenced by judges in the Youth Court.\n\nMany had significant emotional and psychological problems but were not assessed for their needs such as disability or neurodiversity.\n\nStaff estimated that 80% were M\u0101ori, 14% P\u0101keh\u0101, and 5% Pacific peoples.\n\nMost were male but some were female. They were mostly aged between 14 and 16 but some were as young as 12.\n\nThey were sent to the programme for between one and six months. Although the young person or their guardian's consent was required, this was not always obtained.\n\nChildren and young people were housed in substandard tents, with long drop toilets and little or no hot water for bathing.\n\nThe daily emphasis was on physically demanding work, such as chopping and moving firewood, hunting and gardening.\n\nSupervisors had guns, ostensibly for hunting, but these were also used to instil discipline and, at times, to facilitate sexual assault.\n\n\"Survivors described extreme psychological, physical and sexual abuse at Whakapakari causing severe mental and physical pain,\" the report said.\n\n\"They were also physically, educationally and medically neglected.\n\n\"There is evidence to suggest physical and sexual abuse were used as punishment as well as to intimidate.\n\n\"Instead of being rehabilitated, survivors suffered immense harm from their experiences there.\n\nThe state funded the programme until its closure in 2004 but failed to monitor it or to safeguard the children and young people in its care at Whakapakari.\n\nIn first-person testimony, one man described being forced to dig a grave and lie in it while a supervisor fired shots overhead. He also described being raped at the camp.\n\nThe commission said that research demonstrated that boot camps and other harsh \"short sharp shock\" interventions for youth are ineffective at reducing repeat offending.\n\nDepartment of Justice research in 1983 found that 71% of young people reoffended within 12 months of release.\n\nIn 1988, reconviction rates of young offenders in these settings were 92%.\n\n\"Survivors of Whakapakari suffer from long-term conditions such as PTSD and terror of meeting their abusers,\" the report said.\n\n\"Almost all have experienced drug and alcohol addiction and every one of the survivors has been in prison since they attended the programme. Some survivors remain there to this day.\"\n\nFormer Minister of Child, Youth and Family, Ruth Dyson, said of Whakapakari in 2017: \"A lot of government money was put into that programme and in the end it resulted in the state funding violence and abuse towards children and young people. That's how horrific it was.\"\n\nThe Hokio School and the Kohitere Boys' Training Centre near Levin were among the most abusive of all social welfare residential boys' homes in New Zealand, the report said\n\n\"Each had cultures of normalised and pervasive violence,\" the report said.\n\n\"Extreme physical abuse was routinely meted out by staff members to punish, contain and humiliate boys. Many survivors experienced severe corporal punishment from staff, sometimes inflicted with weapons and to the genitals.\"\n\nStaff also punished boys with extreme physical training and inhumane tasks, while assaulting them at the same time.\n\nSurvivors also experienced significant violence from other children.\n\nYounger or physically smaller boys, including the few P\u0101keh\u0101 boys, were often a target for abuse from other children and young people.\n\nStaff often condoned, encouraged or ignored peer\u2011on\u2011peer violence through a king\u2011pin system, including violent \"stomping\" initiations of new boys, who were then expected to do the same to others.\n\nSexual abuse was also pervasive. It was inflicted on survivors by staff members, occasional adult visitors, and other boys.\n\n\"One third of registered survivors from these institutions were groomed, sexually abused, or brutally raped by staff,\" the report said.\n\n\"Groups of older boys raped and sexually abused younger boys - one quarter of survivors described being sexually abused by their peers.\"\n\nSolitary confinement or seclusion was misused, and was often used to punish those who had tried to run away.\n\nSome survivors were kept for days, weeks and sometimes months in prison\u2011like solitary confinement as a punishment, and were physically and psychologically abused while in there.\n\nRacism and cultural abuse were normalised.\n\n\"Many survivors suffer from post\u2011traumatic stress disorder, nightmares, depression and suicidal ideation. Some have died by suicide.\n\n\"Many survivors had issues with drug and alcohol use and addiction later in life, and many committed offences connected to their addictions and trauma.\n\nMore than half of the survivors from these institutions who spoke to the Inquiry had been in prison at some point in their lives.\n\nOne survivor told the inquiry he was made to do physical training naked.\n\n\"This involved me running laps around the block, still completely naked,\" he said. \"Every 10th lap you would do push-ups in the middle of the yard. Every time I ran past Mrs [staff member], she would hit me with a metal hearth shovel.\"\n\nSome survivors intentionally committed offences sufficiently serious to ensure they would be discharged as a ward of the state, with borstal or prison seen as preferable to care.\n\n\"Hokio School and Kohitere Centre were places where gangs were formed,\" the report said.\n\nAccording to one survivor, Wiremu Waikari, who was abused in Hokio and Kohitere and later went on to borstal, these institutions turned out hundreds of young men who later became gang members.\n\n\"In the 1960s and 1970s, gangs in New Zealand really kicked off because the boys' homes were feeding them with disenfranchised young people who were not nurtured by M\u0101ori or the state,\" he told the inquiry.\n\n\"That is definitely where my time in state care pushed me, and hundreds of other unhappy M\u0101ori kids, who weren't sure of themselves in any world.\"\n\nWaikari later left the Mongrel Mob and trained to become a social worker.\n\nAnother survivor, Paora (Paul) Sweeney, who later became a prison counsellor, said New Zealand's gang problem began in the institutions.\n\n\"Kohitere was the start of it all. The gang problem in the country today comes from there.\n\n\"A lot of the boys from Kohitere were in the gangs with me later on,\" he said.\n\n\"They were mostly M\u0101ori... It's called Kohitere Boys' Training Centre, but I don't know what they were training to do. Be gang members?\"\n\nThe inquiry agreed that Hokio School and Kohitere Centre were places where gangs were formed.\n\n\"The state placed children and young people who were already vulnerable in these places, allowed abuse and neglect to occur, and provided no assistance to survivors to work through the impacts of abuse, neglect and trauma.\"\n\n\"Instead, many survivors found protection, connection, support and understanding by joining gangs.\"\n\nForty-one former people who had been members of the Gloriavale community on the West Coast of the South Island gave evidence to the commission.\n\nThey failed to protect survivors, and to recognise the harm the abuse caused.\n\nThey responded to abuse allegations by \"seeking repentance from offenders and forgiveness from victims\", inappropriately dealing with perpetrators, allowing them to remain in the community and continuing to abuse.\n\nThe commission said Gloriavale handled abuse complaints internally, without involving external authorities such as the police or Oranga Tamariki.\n\nThey also created a culture through the community's doctrines that allowed abuse to occur.\n\n\"If someone made an allegation of sexual abuse against a male member of the community, the leaders did not let the rest of the community know, even if children are involved,\" former Gloriavale member Zion Pilgrim said.", "source":

Of these, it estimated 200,000 were abused and even more were neglected.\n\nThe true number will never be known because some records were never created, were lost, or in some cases destroyed.\n\n\"Abuse and neglect were widespread throughout the inquiry period.\"\n\nThe abuse and neglect could not be justified by the standards of the day, or now, the report said.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions.\"\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family.\n\nThe commission was established in 2018, initially to look into abuse in state care, and later expanded its remit to include religious or \"faith-based\" organisations.\n\nThe final report is 2944 pages long in 16 volumes, the last of which is a 364-page book of stories from \"survivors\", the word used by the royal commission to describe the people who had been abused and neglected. The youngest person to give evidence was 14, the oldest was 87.\n\nThe report found fault with successive Government ministers and departments, and a range of religious organisations including the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, the Salvation Army and the Gloriavale religious community on the West Coast.\n\nEven the police were found to be at fault, for several failings, including the disproportionate representation of M\u0101ori in the justice system, negative treatment of Pacific peoples and disabled people, not following policies on the treatment of minors and using police cells to detain children and young people, sometimes for weeks.\n\nThe report called for official apologies and redress from the Government and the organisations responsible.\n\nIt said the apologies should be made by the global heads of the churches involved, including the Pope for the Catholic Church and the Archbishop of Canterbury for the Anglicans.\n\nPolice were asked to establish a specialist unit dedicated to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the abuse, and the inquiry also called for a review of the appropriateness of street names and public amenities named after a proven perpetrator.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon, who called it \"a dark and sorrowful day\" following the report's release, said the Government would make a formal apology on November 12.\n\nThe report found abuse across the spectrum of care settings from foster homes to large institutions, perpetrated by a wide range of people, including professionals and clinicians.\n\nThe abuse \"almost always\" started from the day a person was placed in care and often continued until they left. For some, this meant years or even decades of frequent abuse and neglect.\n\n\"For some, it was a lifetime; for others, it led to an unmarked grave.\"\n\nAnother recommendation called for an inquiry into these unmarked graves, evidence of which had been found at former psychiatric institutions across New Zealand, particularly at Porirua, Tokanui and Sunnyside Hospitals.\n\nThe report said children, young people and adults were regularly treated without compassion, wilfully neglected or denied basic necessities such as privacy, food and suitable clothing.\n\nM\u0101ori, who made up 44% of those who came forward during the inquiry phase, experienced harsher treatment in many settings, being \"degraded\" because of their ethnicity and skin colour.\n\nThey were denied access to practise tikanga or communicate in te reo, or to connect with their whakapapa, sometimes violently.\n\nPacific peoples also experienced racial abuse and cultural neglect. Deaf people and those with disabilities were subjected to targeted abuse and derogatory verbal abuse.\n\nThe report says physical abuse was prevalent across all settings, and staff often pitted children and young people against each other, encouraging peer-on-peer abuse.\n\n\"In some cases, staff went to extremes to inflict as much pain as possible using weapons and electric shocks.\"\n\nSexual abuse was commonplace in both state and faith-based settings.\n\nAbusers groomed children, young people and vulnerable adults into trusting them.\n\nThey also deceived other staff, volunteers and leaders into believing they were trustworthy, which meant survivors who tried to disclose abuse were disbelieved.\n\nMany survivors were sexually assaulted, raped and forced to perform sexual acts. Sexual abuse was used to punish and intimidate.\n\n\"In some cases, the inquiry was told abusers organised the sexual abuse of survivors by trafficking them to members of the public.\"\n\nThe inquiry reiterated an earlier finding, previously reported, on the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit near Marton, which found the use of electric shocks and the drug paraldehyde as punishment met official definitions of torture.\n\nLuxon acknowledged the Lake Alice findings in his press conference today.\n\n\"I am sorry it has taken so long for this acknowledgement of torture,\" he said.\n\nPeople were abused in care arrangements right across a spectrum, from state placements in foster care, through boys' homes and boot camps, schools run by religious organisations, to large-scale hospitals and institutions.\n\nThe abused and neglected ranged from babies left unattended in cots without human contact, to long-term adult patients in psychiatric care.\n\n\"Babies were at times left in cots, with no hugs, physical interaction or other expressions of care.\"\n\nMany survivors recounted extreme sexual and physical abuse they experienced as children and adolescents.\n\n\"It cannot be emphasised enough that many of the victims of abuse and neglect, including of serious abuse, were children,\" the report said.\n\n\"Children are vulnerable simply because of their age. Those in care were often extremely vulnerable because of the circumstances that led them to be in care. There was an even greater vulnerability for disabled children. Similar considerations apply in respect of disabled people more generally and adults in care.\"\n\nSuccessive Governments pursued policies of large-scale institutions for people with mental health issues, or with learning difficulties or disabilities.\n\nThe Kimberley Centre near Levin, which received a volume of its own in the report, sometimes housed more than 750 people.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1972, the number of beds in psychopaedic hospitals increased from 549 to 2017.\n\nA report in 1953 recommended large-scale residential institutions, which could accommodate 400 to 500 children from five years old, as the best model of care for children with learning disabilities. This was despite international best practice that identified community care as the best model, and opposition from parent groups.\n\nDeaf and disabled people were placed in institutions including psychopaedic and psychiatric hospitals, specialist wards in general hospitals, and education settings such as special schools and residential schools and occupational training centres.\n\nDisabled people were often identified as disabled at a young age. Social attitudes contributed to disabled people being considered less valuable than other people.\n\nFor M\u0101ori, this was further compounded by racism.\n\nThe people in care had diverse needs, but the report noted that they all needed support and caring, strong protective factors and safeguarding.\n\nMany survivors told the inquiry about the \"horrific\" abuse and neglect they experienced while in care and the lifelong impacts for them and their families and wh\u0101nau.\n\n\"For many survivors, the abuse and neglect they experienced in care resulted in serious and debilitating addictions, an inability to form stable or loving relationships, missed opportunities for educational and vocational achievement and feelings of a deep sense of shame or blame,\" the report said.\n\n\"For some, it set them on a pathway to imprisonment. The Inquiry has heard it led others to take their own lives.\"\n\nDr Rawiri Waretini-Karena, an academic who was in prison for 10 years after being convicted of murder as a teenager, is quoted in the report.\n\n\"I was 18 when I walked into the yard - never been to prison before,\" he said.\n\n\"I walked out into the yard and there were 50 men there. I knew 45 of them, that's because they were beside me in the social welfare homes, the family homes and the boys' homes.\n\n\"So that's when I realised there was a pipeline to prison process.\"\n\nThe report said there was no single identifiable \"bad apple\" type of abuser.\n\n\"Abusers were male, female, young, old, P\u0101keh\u0101, M\u0101ori, Pacific Peoples, people from other ethnic groups, leaders, respected members of communities, unskilled workers, caregivers, volunteers, educated professionals including teachers, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and medical staff.\"\n\n\"They were also religious leaders including bishops, priests, religious sisters, religious brothers, deacons, lay people.\n\n\"Abusers were single, married with children, heterosexual, homosexual and celibate people.\"\n\nMany held highly-skilled or senior positions. Some were charismatic leaders. Most were adults.\n\nMany survivors were afraid to disclose abuse because of the power adults had over them.\n\nAbusers were able to misuse the power, control and opportunity that came with their positions to perpetrate abuse and neglect, sometimes going undetected for long periods.\n\nPositions that allowed a high degree of unsupervised contact with, or control over, people in care provided the greatest opportunities for abuse - for example, positions in foster homes, boarding schools, institutions and residences.\n\nFoster parents similarly had almost total power and control over a foster child or young person's life.\n\nStaff and volunteers in school hostels or boarding facilities held positions that gave them considerable power and control over the daily routines of those in their care.\n\n\"Abusers were able to use these positions of power and control to carry out abuse and neglect, with high rates of sexual abuse in some settings,\" the report said.\n\nMedical professionals and healthcare workers had \"coercive\" statutory powers to place people in care (at times without consent), decide their treatment including using compulsory orders.\n\n\"Some people misused the power and control that came with these positions to inflict certain types of abuse and neglect.\"\n\nIn religious settings, abusers occupied a wide range of positions.\n\nMany of them benefited from the elevated moral authority and/or power attributed to people in religious roles - bishop, pastor, minister, brother, priest, elder or shepherd - but volunteers or lay people also assumed moral authority.\n\nIn these contexts, abuse occurred in a religious framework or used religious beliefs as justification.\n\nThe report said a higher proportion of people were abused in faith-based settings than in State care.\n\nThe highest reported levels of sexual abuse were at Dilworth School in Auckland (Anglican), Marylands School in Christchurch (Catholic) and \"at Catholic institutions in general\".\n\nData from the Catholic Church showed that among the diocesan clergy, there were 378 reports of abuse made against 182 individuals, constituting 14% of all diocesan clergy during the inquiry period.\n\nAmong male members of religious orders, 599 reports of abuse were made against 187 individuals, representing 8% of all male members of religious orders during the same period.\n\n\"Abusers lied, silenced survivors and manipulated others to avoid accountability,\" the report said.\n\n\"Many abusers were adept at hiding their abuse or avoiding accountability once concerns had been raised.\"\n\nAbusers would often take steps so that survivors who had disclosed abuse or neglect were not believed.\n\nMany abusers developed strong relationships with their colleagues, which worked in their favour when concerns were raised.\n\nOther abusers would use their positions to silence or prevent survivors from disclosing abuse or neglect, telling them they would not be believed.\n\nOthers bullied survivors, threatened further abuse and, in some instances, threatened to kill them or hurt members of their family if they told anyone.\n\nThere was also peer\u2011on\u2011peer abuse in care, where people were abused by others of a similar age or in the same care setting.\n\n\"In care settings, a culture of physical or sexual violence could be established through staff condoning or even encouraging peer-on-peer abuse between residents.\"\n\nIn the words of one man who had been at the Van Asch College for deaf students in Christchurch in 1979: \"The older boys would often act as a pack and they would target me.\"\n\n\"About three times, boarding staff saw this same group of boys target me, take my pants off and try to assault me. Every time, the staff just laughed and did nothing. They found it funny.\"\n\nAbout 44% of the people who came forward to the inquiry were M\u0101ori, 2.5 times the proportion of M\u0101ori in the general population.\n\nThe report said M\u0101ori survivors told the inquiry of the \"overt and targeted racism\" they endured.\n\nThis included cultural neglect and the deliberate stripping away of M\u0101ori survivors from their culture, language, and identity in both State and faith-based care.\n\nThose who were adopted were legally severed from their whakapapa.\n\n\"Cultural genocide as defined by international law is the systematic destruction of traditions, values, language, and other elements that make one group of people distinct from another,\" the report said.\n\n\"While the Inquiry has not found a particular policy that expresses cultural genocide as a goal or intention of the care system, M\u0101ori have been disproportionately targeted, removed from their culture and placed into care systems that have not prioritised or provided for their traditions, values, and language.\"\n\nThis had also disrupted the transmission of knowledge, tikanga, te reo and collective identity to younger generations.\n\nThe Inquiry agreed with a Waitangi Tribunal finding that Crown care policies had been dominated by efforts to assimilate M\u0101ori to the P\u0101keh\u0101 way, which it called \"the most fundamental and persuasive breach\" of te Tiriti o Waitangi and its principles.\n\n\"Care systems were part of the ongoing effect of colonisation,\" the report said.\n\nThe care system had a hostile attitude towards the use and retention of te reo M\u0101ori, and some survivors had their M\u0101ori names changed or were punished for speaking te reo M\u0101ori.\n\n\"M\u0101ori survivors suffered a range of abuse and neglect across care settings, including psychological, emotional, physical, sexual, cultural, educational, medical, and spiritual abuse and neglect, on top of the effects of colonisation and urbanisation.\"\n\nThe Kimberley Hospital near Levin, later known as the Kimberley Centre, which sometimes housed more than 750 people, is one of a number of institutions with its own case study within the report.\n\nFor the 61 years from 1945 that the Kimberley Centre was open, the institution had a \"significantly harmful impact\" on the lives of many of the disabled people who lived there, the report said.\n\nMany disabled children, young people and adults were placed at the Kimberley Centre by their family, commonly on the advice of a medical practitioner, in the belief that it was the best place for them.\n\nSome were sent there by their family for respite care and others arrived through transfers or patient swaps with other institutions.\n\n\"Physical and sexual abuse of disabled children, young people and adults at the Kimberley Centre was pervasive and severe.\"\n\n\"Physical abuse by staff and peers was common and normalised at the Kimberley Centre.\n\n\"This was reflected by the 'Kimberley cringe' where survivors would cower and protect their head if they were approached quickly.\"\n\nStaff and other patients at the Kimberley Centre committed rape and severe sexual assaults involving intimidation and punishment on disabled children, young people and adults.\n\nYoung people were forced to abuse their peers.\n\n\"Some staff took payment from groups of external abusers to organise rapes targeting M\u0101ori and non-speaking disabled children and young people,\" the report said.\n\nMany disabled children, young people and adults were placed in seclusion, sometimes as punishment for their behaviour. Some were sedated in seclusion until they calmed down, which could take hours or days.\n\nOthers were locked into day rooms for long periods and overnight with the lights off because of understaffing, in breach of policy.\n\nNeglect was pervasive. Survivors experienced psychological and emotional neglect; physical, cultural, medical, nutritional and educational neglect.\n\nThe emotional and psychological needs of disabled babies, children, young people and adults were largely neglected - they were not hugged, cuddled, or loved.\n\nThere was little to do, with residents spending 80% of their time in no form of purposeful activity, and 70% of their time in their villas.\n\nNutritional practices were poor. Some disabled children, young people and adults reported that they lost weight, were not fed for long periods, and some were fed with unnecessary feeding tubes.\n\nYoung people were sent to the Whakapakari Youth Programme, or \"boot camp\", on Great Barrier Island between 1977 and 2004 to be \"straightened out\".\n\nInstead, their lives were ruined from the abuse they suffered there, the report said.\n\nOne P\u0101keh\u0101 survivor told the commission of a \"rape club\" culture when he attended Whakapakari in 1990.\n\nSometimes the abuse occurred after a firearm was brandished at the boys.\n\nThe programme was government-funded to use the environment and outdoor activities to supposedly deprogramme youth from drug abuse, develop self\u2011esteem and learn skills, M\u0101oritanga and gain confidence.\n\nThe geographically isolated \"boot camp\" had harsh conditions that emphasised survival skills, military-style discipline, subservience, self\u2011sufficiency and hard physical labour.\n\nThe young people sent there endured cruel and inhumane treatment.\n\nChildren and young people in the custody of the Director General of Social Welfare were sent there by social workers or sentenced by judges in the Youth Court.\n\nMany had significant emotional and psychological problems but were not assessed for their needs such as disability or neurodiversity.\n\nStaff estimated that 80% were M\u0101ori, 14% P\u0101keh\u0101, and 5% Pacific peoples.\n\nMost were male but some were female. They were mostly aged between 14 and 16 but some were as young as 12.\n\nThey were sent to the programme for between one and six months. Although the young person or their guardian's consent was required, this was not always obtained.\n\nChildren and young people were housed in substandard tents, with long drop toilets and little or no hot water for bathing.\n\nThe daily emphasis was on physically demanding work, such as chopping and moving firewood, hunting and gardening.\n\nSupervisors had guns, ostensibly for hunting, but these were also used to instil discipline and, at times, to facilitate sexual assault.\n\n\"Survivors described extreme psychological, physical and sexual abuse at Whakapakari causing severe mental and physical pain,\" the report said.\n\n\"They were also physically, educationally and medically neglected.\n\n\"There is evidence to suggest physical and sexual abuse were used as punishment as well as to intimidate.\n\n\"Instead of being rehabilitated, survivors suffered immense harm from their experiences there.\n\nThe State funded the programme until its closure in 2004 but failed to monitor it or to safeguard the children and young people in its care at Whakapakari.\n\nIn first-person testimony, one man described being forced to dig a grave and lie in it while a supervisor fired shots overhead. He also described being raped at the camp.\n\nThe commission said that research demonstrated that boot camps and other harsh \"short sharp shock\" interventions for youth are ineffective at reducing repeat offending.\n\nDepartment of Justice research in 1983 found that 71% of young people reoffended within 12 months of release.\n\nIn 1988, reconviction rates of young offenders in these settings were 92%.\n\n\"Survivors of Whakapakari suffer from long-term conditions such as PTSD and terror of meeting their abusers,\" the report said.\n\n\"Almost all have experienced drug and alcohol addiction and every one of the survivors has been in prison since they attended the programme. Some survivors remain there to this day.\"\n\nFormer Minister of Child, Youth and Family, Ruth Dyson, said of Whakapakari in 2017: \"A lot of government money was put into that programme and in the end it resulted in the State funding violence and abuse towards children and young people. That's how horrific it was.\"\n\nThe Hokio School and the Kohitere Boys' Training Centre near Levin were among the most abusive of all social welfare residential boys' homes in New Zealand, the report said\n\nThe volume of the report dealing with these institutions, which contained mainly M\u0101ori, is headed \"a cauldron of violence\".\n\n\"Each had cultures of normalised and pervasive violence,\" the report said.\n\n\"Extreme physical abuse was routinely meted out by staff members to punish, contain and humiliate boys. Many survivors experienced severe corporal punishment from staff, sometimes inflicted with weapons and to the genitals.\"\n\nStaff also punished boys with extreme physical training and inhumane tasks, while assaulting them at the same time.\n\nSurvivors also experienced significant violence from other children.\n\nYounger or physically smaller boys, including the few P\u0101keh\u0101 boys, were often a target for abuse from other children and young people.\n\nStaff often condoned, encouraged or ignored peer\u2011on\u2011peer violence through a king\u2011pin system, including violent \"stomping\" initiations of new boys, who were then expected to do the same to others.\n\nSexual abuse was also pervasive. It was inflicted on survivors by staff members, occasional adult visitors, and other boys.\n\n\"One third of registered survivors from these institutions were groomed, sexually abused, or brutally raped by staff,\" the report said.\n\n\"Groups of older boys raped and sexually abused younger boys - one quarter of survivors described being sexually abused by their peers.\"\n\nSolitary confinement or seclusion was misused, and was often used to punish those who had tried to run away.\n\nSome survivors were kept for days, weeks and sometimes months in prison\u2011like solitary confinement as a punishment, and were physically and psychologically abused while in there.\n\nRacism and cultural abuse were normalised.\n\n\"Many survivors suffer from post\u2011traumatic stress disorder, nightmares, depression and suicidal ideation. Some have died by suicide.\n\n\"Many survivors had issues with drug and alcohol use and addiction later in life, and many committed offences connected to their addictions and trauma.\n\nMore than half of the survivors from these institutions who spoke to the Inquiry had been in prison at some point in their lives.\n\nOne survivor told the inquiry he was made to do physical training naked.\n\n\"This involved me running laps around the block, still completely naked,\" he said. \"Every 10th lap you would do push-ups in the middle of the yard. Every time I ran past Mrs [Staff Member], she would hit me with a metal hearth shovel.\"\n\nSome survivors intentionally committed offences sufficiently serious to ensure they would be discharged as a ward of the State, with borstal or prison seen as preferable to care.\n\n\"Hokio School and Kohitere Centre were places where gangs were formed,\" the report said.\n\nAccording to one survivor, Wiremu Waikari, who was abused in Hokio and Kohitere and later went on to borstal, these institutions turned out hundreds of young men who later became gang members.\n\n\"In the 1960s and 1970s, gangs in New Zealand really kicked off because the boys' homes were feeding them with disenfranchised young people who were not nurtured by M\u0101ori or the State,\" he told the inquiry.\n\n\"That is definitely where my time in State care pushed me, and hundreds of other unhappy M\u0101ori kids, who weren't sure of themselves in any world.\"\n\nWaikari later left the Mongrel Mob and trained to become a social worker.\n\nAnother survivor, Paora (Paul) Sweeney, who later became a prison counsellor, said New Zealand's gang problem began in the institutions.\n\n\"Kohitere was the start of it all. The gang problem in the country today comes from there.\n\n\"A lot of the boys from Kohitere were in the gangs with me later on,\" he said.\n\n\"They were mostly M\u0101ori ... It's called Kohitere Boys' Training Centre, but I don't know what they were training to do. Be gang members?\"\n\nThe inquiry agreed that Hokio School and Kohitere Centre were places where gangs were formed.\n\n\"The State placed children and young people who were already vulnerable in these places, allowed abuse and neglect to occur, and provided no assistance to survivors to work through the impacts of abuse, neglect and trauma.\"\n\n\"Instead, many survivors found protection, connection, support and understanding by joining gangs.\"\n\nForty-one former people who had been members of the Gloriavale community on the West Coast of the South Island gave evidence to the commission.\n\nThe report found that from Gloriavale's inception in 1969 through to the end of the Inquiry period, the community's senior leadership were at fault for allowing physical and sexual abuse to happen within their flock.\n\nThey failed to protect survivors, and to recognise the harm the abuse caused.\n\nThey responded to abuse allegations by \"seeking repentance from offenders and forgiveness from victims\", inappropriately dealing with perpetrators, allowing them to remain in the community and continuing to abuse.\n\nThe commission said Gloriavave handled abuse complaints internally, without involving external authorities such as the police or Oranga Tamariki.\n\nThey also created a culture through the community's doctrines that allowed abuse to occur.\n\n\"If someone made an allegation of sexual abuse against a male member of the community, the leaders did not let the rest of the community know, even if children are involved,\" former Gloriavale member Zion Pilgrim said.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ric_stevens@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "Ric Stevens", "type": "author", "isAgency":

It cut into my skin until I bled and I couldn't sit down afterwards for weeks,\" she said in testimony published in the report.\n\nJesse Kett spoke of how he was beaten and raped by staff in a residential school in Auckland when he was eight years old - recounting in his testimony that other staff members would sometimes watch the abuse happen.\n\nMoeapulu Frances Tagaloa was abused by a priest for two years from the age of five in the 1970s.\n\n\"He was a popular, well-known teacher,\" she said.\n\n\"But he was also a paedophile and unfortunately there were other little girls that he abused.\"\n\nMs Tagaloa now works to help other survivors and has called for all 138 recommendations included in the report to be implemented.\n\nThe report found that M\u0101ori and Pacific survivors endured higher levels of physical abuse, and were often \"degraded because of their ethnicity and skin colour\".\n\nIt also found that children and people in foster care experienced the highest levels of sexual abuse among various social welfare care settings.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions,\" the report said.\n\n\"Many survivors died while they were in care or by suicide following care. For others, the impacts of abuse are ongoing and compounding, making everyday activities and choices challenging,\" it added.\n\nMr Luxon said: \"We should have done better, and I am determined we will do so.\n\n\"To every person who took part, I say thank you for your exceptional strength, your incredible courage and your confronting honesty. Because of you, we know the truth about the abuse and trauma you have endured,\" he said, describing many of the stories as horrific and harrowing.\n\n\"I cannot take away your pain, but I can tell you this: you are heard and you are believed.\"\n\nHe added that it was too soon to reveal how much the government expected to pay victims in compensation. He said he would offer a formal apology on 12 November.\n\nAccording to the report, the economic cost of this abuse and neglect has been estimated to be anywhere from NZ$96bn to $217bn, taking into consideration negative outcomes including increased mental and physical healthcare costs, homelessness and crime.\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of care abuse survivors took part in a march to parliament before the inquiry was released.\n\nOne survivor called the report \"historic\".\n\n\"For decades they told us we made it up,\" Toni Jarvis told news agency Reuters. \"So this today is historic and it's an acknowledgement. It acknowledges all the survivors that have been courageous enough to share their stories.\"\n\nAcademic Dr Rawiri Waretini-Karena, who was a witness in the inquiry, had earlier spoken about the \"pipeline from state care to prison\".\n\n\"When I walked into the prison yard for the first time as a teenager, having never been there before - I already knew 80% of the men in there. We'd spent the last 11 years growing up together in state care,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for Radio New Zealand.\n\n\"That's when I knew there was a pipeline to prison; a pipeline that has spent decades sweeping up and funnelling M\u0101ori children from state care to prison.\"\n\nDr Waretini-Karena added that the Royal Commission's report acknowledged \"that whilst we are responsible for our actions, we are not responsible for the hidden mechanisms that operate within the environment we are born into, privileging one faction at the expense of the other\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphanage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orphanage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Indian residential school system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/286465ed0384f85cfe460ed7b87e828b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 3343, "textEnd": 3354}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

I'm pretty happy that this day has finally happened.\"\n\nWiffin was instrumental in persuading the previous Labour Government to launch an inquiry into abuse in state care six years ago. He was later made a member of the Royal Commission's Survivor Advisory Group.\n\nToday, he said victims of abuse, estimated to be as many as 200,000, felt they had been heard, listened to and acknowledged by the commission.\n\n\"Survivors carried themselves with great dignity. It was very uplifting to be among them in the public gallery.\n\n\"There was an overriding feeling of solidarity today. And there was a ... feeling that something now will finally be done for all those who have suffered.\n\n\"It was made clear in all the MPs' speeches that we still have unacceptable rates of abuse, and that's where the focus needs to be.\"\n\nHe said: \"There are very senior people who need to hang their heads in shame for the ways they have conducted themselves, both in the state and church - in trying to deny, minimise and cover-up for as long as they have done.\n\n\"Unfortunately, a lot of the state's resources have been channelled into that approach.\"\n\nWiffin was sent to Epuni Boys' Home, in Lower Hutt, in the 1970s.\n\nOne of four children, he was handed over to the state because his mother was struggling after the death of his father at age 38. He had developed behavioural problems and ran away from home on one occasion.\n\nHe had two stints at Epuni - the first was eight months and the second, three months - with several years in between spent at \"family homes\", large foster homes with more than a dozen children.\n\nAt Epuni, Wiffin faced violence at the hands of staff members and was sexually abused by a housemaster, Alan Moncrieff-Wright.\n\nHis initial attempts to get justice stalled, despite the Crown being aware Moncrieff-Wright had been convicted for similar offending in 1972 and 1988.\n\nMoncrieff-Wright was eventually convicted in 2011 of assaulting three boys, including Wiffin.\n\nAfter suing the government, Wiffin received an apology from government officials and a $20,000 payment, but he said this worsened his feelings of guilt.\n\nHe was confident that thr Government would commit to a new, independent redress system - one of the key recommendations from the commission.\n\nThe abuse and neglect of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders in the care of state and faith-based institutions has been branded \"a national disgrace\".\n\nThe long-awaited report of the Abuse in Care Royal Commission, six years in the making, was released this afternoon.\n\n\"Instead of receiving care and support, children, young people and adults in care were exposed to unimaginable physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse, severe exploitation and neglect,\" the report says.\n\nIt found people who had suffered during decades of systemic abuse had received little redress and \"if this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever\".\n\nAmong its 138 recommendations, the inquiry proposed avenues be opened up allowing for compensation claims to be made in the courts, outside the ACC system.\n\nAn estimated 655,000 children, young people and adults were in care during the period under review, from 1950 to 2019. Of these, it is estimated 200,000 were abused and even more were neglected.\n\nThe true number will never be known because some records were never created, were lost or, in some cases, destroyed.\n\n\"Abuse and neglect were widespread throughout the inquiry period.\"\n\nThe abuse and neglect could not be justified by the standards of the day, or now, the report said.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family.\"\n\nThe commission was established in 2018, initially to look into abuse in state care, and later expanded its remit to include religious or \"faith-based\" organisations.\n\nThe final report is 2944 pages long in 16 volumes, the last of which is a 364-page book of stories from \"survivors\", the word used by the royal commission to describe the people who had been abused and neglected. The youngest person to give evidence was 14, the oldest was 87.\n\nThe report found fault with successive government ministers and departments, and a range of religious organisations including the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, the Salvation Army and the Gloriavale religious community on the West Coast.\n\nEven the police were found to be at fault, for several failings, including the disproportionate representation of M\u0101ori in the justice system, negative treatment of Pacific peoples and disabled people, not following policies on the treatment of minors and using police cells to detain children and young people, sometimes for weeks.\n\nThe report called for official apologies and redress from the Government and the organisations responsible.\n\nIt said the apologies should be made by the global heads of the churches involved, including the Pope, for the Catholic Church, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, for Anglicans.\n\nPolice were asked to establish a specialist unit dedicated to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the abuse, and the inquiry also called for a review of the appropriateness of street names and public amenities named after a proven perpetrator.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon, who called it \"a dark and sorrowful day\" following the report's release, said the Government would make a formal apology on November 12.\n\nThe report found abuse across the spectrum of care settings, from foster homes to large institutions, and perpetrated by a wide range of people, including professionals and clinicians.\n\nThe abuse \"almost always\" started from the day a person was placed in care and often continued until they left. For some, this meant years or even decades of frequent abuse and neglect.\n\n\"For some, it was a lifetime; for others, it led to an unmarked grave.\"\n\nAnother recommendation called for an inquiry into these unmarked graves, evidence of which had been found at former psychiatric institutions across New Zealand, particularly at Porirua, Tokanui and Sunnyside hospitals.", "source": {"uri":

But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 1999 -- in a country which today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the reported said. The figures were likely higher and accurate numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\nLuxon said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "charlotte_graham_mclay@eagletribune.com", "name": "Charlotte GRAHAM-McLAY", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_adult", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerable adult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/be/1be26868-f064-536c-8e87-1e23d5f74cb2/66a07e2e7eba0.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 2294, "textEnd": 2301}], "sentiment": -0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

There have been clear failures to properly investigate and respond when abuse was reported.\"\n\nThey also \"acknowledged that we have not provided accessible, straightforward processes for the handling of disclosures and complaints of abuse\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gibson_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gibson (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hipkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hipkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/24/10/newFile-3.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 1122, "textEnd": 1133}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

I am sorry it has taken so long for this acknowledgement of torture.\"\n\nThe Minister responsible for coordinating the Crown Response to the Abuse in Care Inquiry, Erica Stanford, told RNZ Lake Alice survivors - given their age - would be prioritised and today, the government had acknowledged what happened to them amounted to torture.\n\nStanford said everyone in Parliament would take on the recommendations and each minister would see what they could do in their own individual portfolios to make sure protections are in place.\n\nSome recommendations - that suggested a complete overhaul and legislation changes would take longer than some other recommendations, she said.\n\nChief Children's Commissioner Dr Clair Achmad said \"the report must galvanise real action that makes change\" and welcomed the government's announcement that it would make a formal apology in November.\n\nDr Achmad acknowledged the courage of those survivors who shared their experiences through the inquiry, but said state care and the youth justice system is continuing to harm children and young people.\n\n\"While the Inquiry's report spans experiences from 1950 - 1999, we know that widespread abuse in State and faith-based care did not end then. The Inquiry has heard from rangatahi who have experienced abuse in care much more recently,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe inquiry highlighted that certain groups were over-represented in receiving harsh treatment, particularly tamariki and rangatahi M\u0101ori, she said.\n\nEvery case of child abuse, neglect and maltreatment was one too many and the care system must be safe and uphold the rights of all, she said.\n\n\"This is not a one-off call to action, but something we need to work continuously on as a nation. It's all of our responsibility to end the horrific abuse that is undeniably part of our recent history and our present, so we make Aotearoa New Zealand a safe, caring and inclusive place to be a child.\"\n\nHealth and Disability Commissioner Morag McDowell said the stories of those who told their stories would \"serve as an enduring reminder that we must all work towards the collective change required to prevent systemic abuse and neglect\".\n\nThe Health and Disability Commission continued to see a small but unacceptable number of cases where people had experienced abuse and neglect in care settings, she said.\n\n\"It is clearly unacceptable for people to be subject to trauma and harm in the places where they are meant to be safe, and by the people who are there to care for them. I support many of the recommendations of this report and will work to uphold people's rights with a view to improving systems and other safeguards to prevent continued recurrence of abuse and neglect,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe Royal Commission highlighted the importance of independent advocates in mitigating the power imbalance between people receiving care and providers, she said.\n\nThe Citizens Commission on Human Rights said the government needed to make sure the abuse uncovered by the Royal Commission of Inquiry did not happen again.\n\nDirector Mike Ferris said it was now up to the government to redress the wrongs of the past and ensure a better future.\n\n\"The prime minister's announced he's gonna make an apology. That apology will be very important for survivors, but with an apology, there has to be some action,\" he said.\n\n\"What many of the survivors want is to have this never happen again to any child in care,\" Ferris said.\n\nOpposition leader Chris Hipkins has committed to working in a bipartisan way on Abuse in Care recommendations and redress.\n\nHe said the inquiry's report was \"harrowing and confronting\" - and only the start of making amends.\n\nHipkins said the abuse occurred under successive governments of different stripes - and politicians would need to work across the House on redress.\n\n\"It's going to take some time, it's going to be hard work. The next steps of this process are going to span over multiple governments as well. This should not be about politics in any way, this must be about doing the right thing.\"\n\nIt was imperative politicians read the report in full, so survivors did not have to keep telling their stories, Hipkins said.\n\nThe Children's Minister said the Abuse in Care Royal Commission of Inquiry has renewed her determination to break the cycle of family and sexual violence.\n\nThe Inquiry has found at least 200,000 people have been abused in state and faith-based care since 1950.\n\nThe Minister for Children - ACT's Karen Chhour said she had \"personal trauma\" from her own time in state care - and wanted the government to do better.\n\n\"This report has renewed my determination to break the cycle of family violence and sexual violence. It's time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside.\"\n\nThe government will make a public apology for abuse in state and faith-based care at Parliament in November.\n\nTe P\u0101ti M\u0101ori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said the government had already failed abuse survivors by ignoring their experience and allowing abuse in state care to still be happening today.\n\nNgarewa-Packer said all of Parliament needed to learn from the lived experience of survivors, otherwise the inquiry report was just lip service.\n\n\"Everything that you have told us in this has been ignored. Every experience that you have asked us to think about continues to be perpetuated by this monstrous system that you've talked about,\" she said in Parliament.\n\nNgarewa-Packer said the trauma of the survivors who told their stories was on the heads of all governments.\n\nThe Green Party said the government must do all it could to bring abuse in care to an end.\n\nGreen Party spokesperson for children Kahurangi Carter said it was incumbent on the government to listen and learn from the stories of the survivors.\n\n\"This five-year inquiry involved painstaking collation of stories from people who have experienced grave mistreatment in care. We as a country have a duty to ensure this inquiry wasn't in vain.\"\n\nThe Anglican Church issued a joint statement attributed to Archbishops Don Tamihere, Justin Duckworth and Archbishop Sione Ulu'ilakepa.\n\n\"We acknowledge and take full responsibility for our failures to provide the safe, caring and nurturing environment those\n\nwho have been in our care had a right to expect and to receive.\"\n\nThe statement also acknowledged the Anglican Church had failed to provide accessible \"consistent processes of redress\".\n\nThe bishops said that they supported in principle the establishment of an independent entity for the handling of future complaints.\n\nThe Catholic Church is acknowledging the abuse and neglect that happened to the most vulnerable, while they were in care in faith-based institutions.\n\nA statement issued by Bishop Steve Lowe and Father Thomas Rouse said the abuse of people in the care of the Church was real and the failures of Church leaders in responding to reports were real.\n\nLeaders in the Catholic Church had a special role to play to ensure that the findings were not lost or confined to words in a report, it said.", "source": {"uri":

He was later made a member of the Royal Commission's Survivor Advisory Group.\n\nToday, he said victims of abuse, estimated to be as many as 200,000, felt they had been heard, listened to and acknowledged by the commission.\n\n\"Survivors carried themselves with great dignity. It was very uplifting to be among them in the public gallery.\n\n\"There was an overriding feeling of solidarity today. And there was a ... feeling that something now will finally be done for all those who have suffered.\n\n\"It was made clear in all the MPs' speeches that we still have unacceptable rates of abuse, and that's where the focus needs to be.\"\n\nHe said: \"There are very senior people who need to hang their heads in shame for the ways they have conducted themselves, both in the state and church - in trying to deny, minimise and cover-up for as long as they have done.\n\n\"Unfortunately, a lot of the state's resources have been channelled into that approach.\"\n\nWiffin was sent to Epuni Boys' Home, in Lower Hutt, in the 1970s.\n\nOne of four children, he was handed over to the state because his mother was struggling after the death of his father at age 38. He had developed behavioural problems and ran away from home on one occasion.\n\nHe had two stints at Epuni - the first was eight months and the second, three months - with several years in between spent at \"family homes\", large foster homes with more than a dozen children.\n\nAt Epuni, Wiffin faced violence at the hands of staff members and was sexually abused by a housemaster, Alan Moncrieff-Wright.\n\nHis initial attempts to get justice stalled, despite the Crown being aware Moncrieff-Wright had been convicted for similar offending in 1972 and 1988.\n\nMoncrieff-Wright was eventually convicted in 2011 of assaulting three boys, including Wiffin.\n\nAfter suing the government, Wiffin received an apology from government officials and a $20,000 payment, but he said this worsened his feelings of guilt.\n\nHe was confident that thr Government would commit to a new, independent redress system - one of the key recommendations from the commission.\n\nThe abuse and neglect of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders in the care of state and faith-based institutions has been branded \"a national disgrace\".\n\nThe long-awaited report of the Abuse in Care Royal Commission, six years in the making, was released this afternoon.\n\n\"Instead of receiving care and support, children, young people and adults in care were exposed to unimaginable physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse, severe exploitation and neglect,\" the report says.\n\nIt found people who had suffered during decades of systemic abuse had received little redress and \"if this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever\".\n\nAmong its 138 recommendations, the inquiry proposed avenues be opened up allowing for compensation claims to be made in the courts, outside the ACC system.\n\nAn estimated 655,000 children, young people and adults were in care during the period under review, from 1950 to 2019. Of these, it is estimated 200,000 were abused and even more were neglected.\n\nThe true number will never be known because some records were never created, were lost or, in some cases, destroyed.\n\n\"Abuse and neglect were widespread throughout the inquiry period.\"\n\nThe abuse and neglect could not be justified by the standards of the day, or now, the report said.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family.\"\n\nThe commission was established in 2018, initially to look into abuse in state care, and later expanded its remit to include religious or \"faith-based\" organisations.\n\nThe final report is 2944 pages long in 16 volumes, the last of which is a 364-page book of stories from \"survivors\", the word used by the royal commission to describe the people who had been abused and neglected. The youngest person to give evidence was 14, the oldest was 87.\n\nThe report found fault with successive government ministers and departments, and a range of religious organisations including the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, the Salvation Army and the Gloriavale religious community on the West Coast.\n\nEven the police were found to be at fault, for several failings, including the disproportionate representation of M\u0101ori in the justice system, negative treatment of Pacific peoples and disabled people, not following policies on the treatment of minors and using police cells to detain children and young people, sometimes for weeks.\n\nThe report called for official apologies and redress from the Government and the organisations responsible.\n\nIt said the apologies should be made by the global heads of the churches involved, including the Pope, for the Catholic Church, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, for Anglicans.\n\nPolice were asked to establish a specialist unit dedicated to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the abuse, and the inquiry also called for a review of the appropriateness of street names and public amenities named after a proven perpetrator.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon, who called it \"a dark and sorrowful day\" following the report's release, said the Government would make a formal apology on November 12.\n\nThe report found abuse across the spectrum of care settings, from foster homes to large institutions, and perpetrated by a wide range of people, including professionals and clinicians.\n\nThe abuse \"almost always\" started from the day a person was placed in care and often continued until they left. For some, this meant years or even decades of frequent abuse and neglect.\n\n\"For some, it was a lifetime; for others, it led to an unmarked grave.\"\n\nAnother recommendation called for an inquiry into these unmarked graves, evidence of which had been found at former psychiatric institutions across New Zealand, particularly at Porirua, Tokanui and Sunnyside hospitals.", "source": {"uri":

This revelation comes from the final report of the Abuse in Care Royal Commission of Inquiry, which looked into the experiences of nearly 3,000 people.\n\nThe inquiry, which represents the most extensive and costly investigation in New Zealand's history, spanned six years and required a budget of about NZ$170 million (roughly US$101 million or \u00a378 million).\n\nAccording to the report, nearly one-third of children in care from 1950 to 2019 suffered various forms of abuse. Disturbing accounts include instances of rape, electric shock treatment, and forced labor. The prevalence of abuse was notably higher among children from disadvantaged communities, particularly M\u0101ori, Pacific peoples, and individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe inquiry heard testimonials from over 2,300 survivors, revealing that the abuse generally began from the very first day in care. Many M\u0101ori and Pacific survivors reported experiencing more severe physical abuse and were often subjected to racial degradation based on their ethnicity. Additionally, children in foster care faced the highest incidents of sexual abuse compared to other forms of social welfare care.\n\nThe Royal Commission's report has been described by officials as a profound national embarrassment, emphasizing the serious consequences of this abuse, including ongoing trauma for many survivors. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon characterized the publication of the report as \"a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history\" and acknowledged the failures of the system, stating, \"we should have done better.\" He has pledged to offer a formal apology on November 12.\n\nThe economic ramifications of the abuse have been estimated between NZ$96 billion (about US$56.9 billion) and NZ$217 billion, factoring in costs related to mental and physical healthcare, homelessness, and increased crime rates.\n\nOn the day of the report's release, many survivors participated in a march to Parliament. One survivor, Toni Jarvis, expressed her feelings about the report, saying, \"For decades they told us we made it up. So this today is historic and it's an acknowledgement. It acknowledges all the survivors that have been courageous enough to share their stories.\"\n\nDr. Rawiri Waretini-Karena, an academic and inquiry witness, highlighted a troubling trend referred to as the \"pipeline from state care to prison,\" indicating that many individuals who grew up in state care end up in the prison system.

Many of the victims were children who had been removed from their families and placed in state, religious or foster care.\n\n\"For some people this meant years or even decades of frequent abuse and neglect,\" the report said. \"For some it was a lifetime; for others it led to an unmarked grave.\"\n\nIn a statement accompanying the release, Coral Shaw, the inquiry's chair, described the abuse as an \"unthinkable national catastrophe.\"\n\nThe results of the investigation were presented to New Zealand's Parliament on Wednesday.\n\n\"I cannot take away your pain, but I can tell you this: Today you are heard and you are believed,\" Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told survivors at a news conference. \"The state was supposed to care for you, to protect you, but instead it subjected you to unimaginable physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse.\"\n\nMr. Luxon said New Zealand's government would formally apologize to survivors in November and he committed to implementing a redress process. He did not answer questions on Wednesday about how much he expected it would cost to compensate victims, but the inquiry indicated that the total could reach billions of dollars.\n\nThe inquiry, established in 2018 by the New Zealand government, involved interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors as it examined orphanages, foster care systems, mental health facilities and other forms of care that were charged with supporting 655,000 people from 1950 through 2019. The inquiry's leaders described it as the widest-ranging examination of its kind in the world.\n\nThe report noted that most children in care were Indigenous Maori, even though the group makes up a minority of the country's overall population of five million people, and said that \"Maori were often targeted because of their ethnicity.\"\n\nBeyond the 200,000 people estimated to have been abused, the report said countless others had suffered neglect. \"The true number will never be fully known as records of the most vulnerable people in Aotearoa New Zealand were never created or were lost and, in some cases, destroyed,\" the report said, referring to the country in Maori and English.\n\nThe inquiry found that even when abuses by government and religious leaders were discovered, the leaders \"were rarely held to account for their actions or inactions, which emboldened them to perpetrate further abuse.\"\n\nAmong the inquiry's 138 recommendations were calls for public apologies from the pope, the archbishop of Canterbury, and New Zealand's police commissioner and its top civil servant. It also urged the government to overhaul the country's no-fault accident compensation program to provide tailored support for survivors of abuse.\n\nThe report prompted New Zealand's Catholic, Methodist and Anglican churches to promise change. \"We will ensure that action follows our review of the inquiry's findings,\" Steve Lowe, president of the New Zealand Catholic Bishops Conference, said in a statement. \"We owe it to survivors,\" the Anglican Church said in another statement.\n\nThe report follows decades of complaints from survivors. \"Survivors repeatedly called for justice but were unheard, disbelieved, and ignored,\" according to the report. \"Significant resources have been used to deny survivors their voice and to defend the indefensible.

The findings could lead to substantial compensation claims from survivors.\n\n\"This is a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history,\" Luxon remarked at a press conference. \"As a society and as a state, we should have done better, and I am committed to ensuring that we will do so.\" An official apology is scheduled for November 12.\n\nThe report was presented while survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery of the New Zealand Parliament. After Luxon's address, many attendees stood and sang an Indigenous Maori song emphasizing love and unity.\n\nThe inquiry, which spoke with over 2,300 survivors in a country of 5.3 million, highlighted egregious abuses that peaked in the 1970s. It found that Indigenous Maori individuals and those with mental or physical disabilities were particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe report also criticized civil and faith leaders for covering up the abuse by relocating perpetrators and denying responsibility, leaving many victims without justice before their deaths.\n\nThe report made 138 recommendations, including public apologies from the New Zealand government, as well as from Pope Francis and the Archbishop of Canterbury, leaders of the Catholic and Anglican churches, respectively. The Catholic Church of New Zealand has stated that it is reviewing the report's findings and is committed to taking action.

It says roughly 200,000 people, including children, young people and vulnerable adults, suffered abuse in care facilities between 1950 and 2019. The report calls it an \"unthinkable national catastrophe.\"\n\nThe six-year investigation by the Abuse in Care Royal Commission of Inquiry, the largest and most expensive probe in the country's history, found that for generations, people at these facilities had been subjected to electric shock, medical experimentation, starvation, beatings, forced labor, and rape. Many of the victims were from the country's disadvantaged and marginalized communities, including the native M\u0101ori and Pacific Islanders, as well as people with disabilities.\n\nNew Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon apologized and said, \"This is a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history as a society and as a state. We should have done better, and I am determined that we will do so.\"\n\nInvestigators spoke to more than 2,300 survivors who detailed how the abuse often started from the day they arrived. Most of the survivors are now over 50 years old, according to the inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry reported that even when these abuses were brought to the attention of government or religious leaders, those accused were rarely held accountable. The report made 138 recommendations, including setting up a Care Safe Agency responsible for overseeing the sector, and called for public apologies from the pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who heads the Anglican Church, and the government of New Zealand.\n\nIn a statement, the Catholic Church in New Zealand said it \"will ensure that action follows our review of the Inquiry's findings.\" The Anglican Church in New Zealand released a statement saying, \"We acknowledge and take full responsibility for our failures to provide the safe, caring and nurturing environment those who have been in our care had a right to expect and to receive.\"\n\nNew Zealand's prime minister said an official apology will come in November. His government will also reveal how much it's expected to pay victims in compensation.\n\nThe report said the average lifetime cost to survivors was estimated in 2020 to be more than half a million dollars per person, while the economic cost of the abuse may have cost the state up to $130 billion when taking into consideration everything from increased mental and physical health care costs to crime and homelessness.\n\nDozens of survivors were on hand when the inquiry was released to Parliament. They said they felt vindicated by its findings.\n\n\"For decades they told us we made it up,\" Toni Jarvis told the Reuters news agency. \"So, this today is historic and it's an acknowledgement.

Abuse and neglect were widespread ... in state and faith-based care institutions,\" the commissioners said.\n\n\"Any abuse and neglect, let alone the prevalence of it, could not be justified by the standards of the day and certainly cannot be justified now.\n\n\"Critical rights, such as those guaranteed to M\u0101ori in te Tiriti o Waitangi and human rights, that should have protected people in care, were ignored and overlooked altogether.\"\n\nThe commissioners made 138 recommendations to right the wrongs of the past; ensure the safety of every child, young person and adult in care today; and to empower and invest in wh\u0101nau and communities.\n\nThey included the establishment of a specialist investigation unit, an independent Care Safe Agency to oversee the care system and a Care System Office, which would later become the Ministry for the Care System, to lead the implementation of the royal commission's recommendations.\n\nThe commissioners also called for the government to \"prioritise and accelerate current work to close care and protection residences, which perpetuate the institutional environments and practices\".\n\n\"Of the estimated 655,000 children, young people and adults in care from 1950 to 2019, it is estimated that 200,000 were abused and even more were neglected,\" the report said.\n\n\"The true number will never be fully known as records of the most vulnerable people in Aotearoa New Zealand were never created or were lost and, in some cases, destroyed.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the State and faith-based institutions.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family. If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever.\"\n\nThe report called for public apologies and accountability from the prime minister, faith leaders, public sector leaders, leaders of relevant professional bodies, leaders of care providers and leaders of faith-based institutions.\n\n\"An apology is hollow without change. With urgency, state and faith-based institutions must implement the inquiry's 2021 recommended puretumu torowh\u0101nui system and scheme. There must be no further delay.\"\n\nThe commissioners were critical of the work to date on its redress recommendations from the interim report He Purapura Ora, he M\u0101ra Tipu - which were presented to the previous Labour Government in December 2021.\n\n\"Since then, there has been very little clear progress by the government in implementing the inquiry's recommendations,\" the commissioners said.\n\n\"Timeframes in He Purapura Ora, he M\u0101ra Tipu have not been met, and the government has not met the timeframes it set itself. The steps the government has taken to date are inconsistent in important respects with the recommendations of the inquiry.\n\n\"Many survivors in Aotearoa New Zealand continue to have no effective remedy, and the puretumu torowh\u0101nui system which the inquiry recommended has not been implemented.\"\n\n\"Unless significant change occurs, this will continue to be the case.\n\n\"Meaningful reform which provides fair, holistic and comprehensive redress will inevitably be expensive for the government and faith-based institutions.\n\n\"The alternative is for many survivors and their wh\u0101nau, and society at large, to continue bearing these costs, despite the abuse having taken place in state and faith-based care and the survivors not being at fault.\"\n\nSurvivors could also pursue a civil litigation process or other means for compensation or settlements, \"which are far beyond anything currently available in Aotearoa New Zealand including through the accident compensation scheme\", the commissioners said.\n\n\"The question is not whether these things can be done, but whether New Zealanders want to ensure survivors of abuse and neglect receive holistic redress that recompenses them for what happened, and the lost economic opportunities and loss of life enjoyment, and in particular whether government wants to do them.\n\n\"Survivors have been told that they matter, they are respected for their courage, and they have been heard. Some apologies have been given, and a national apology is being planned.\n\n\"The inquiry considers much more needs to be done, mostly led by the government. And government needs to act promptly so that survivors do not continue to die without receiving effective, holistic redress.\"\n\nThe commissioners called for urgent action to address the \"systemic and deeply embedded\" harm caused at all levels of care.\n\n\"The findings call for a complete overhaul of Aotearoa New Zealand's state and faith-based care systems in social welfare, disability, mental health, education, and transitional and law enforcement and pastoral care settings.\n\n\"The recommendations comprise mutually reinforcing strands woven together into a k\u0101kahu (cloak) to right the wrongs of the past and protect against abuse and neglect in care in the future.\n\n\"These recommendations cannot be selectively implemented - missing out any of the strands will create gaps and points of weakness in the k\u0101kahu which mean the cycles of abuse and neglect in care will continue.\n\n\"Abuse and neglect in care does not just harm individuals - it imposes a significant burden on wh\u0101nau, kainga and society. The long-term impacts include poor health outcomes, welfare dependency, and increased crime rates.\"", "source": {"uri": "odt.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Otago Daily Times Online News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gibson_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gibson (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compassion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitangi,_Northland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waitangi, Northland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waitangi, Northland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_(demon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mara (demon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wh\u0101nau", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wh\u0101nau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_of_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cycle of abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_dependency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare dependency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastoralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/story/2024/07/abuse_ribbons.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This included physical, emotional, psychological, medical, educational, spiritual, and cultural neglect.\n\nMoreover, discrimination and racism by authorities and the public contributed to the likelihood of being taken into care and the severity of treatment received. The financial cost of abuse in care was staggering, estimated at NZ$96 billion to NZ$217 billion over nearly seven decades.\n\nThe report highlighted that a disproportionate number of Maori entered state care between the 1950s and the 1980s, facing higher levels of abuse. The inquiry, launched in 2018, faced delays due to expanded scope but ultimately provided 138 critical recommendations.\n\nAmong these, the report called for public apologies from national and religious leaders, compensation for survivors, the creation of a National Care Safety Strategy, and the establishment of a specialist police unit for investigating abuse cases.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/17_07_2024_23_03_01_9708066.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

And I really would like to see churches support all the recommendations,\" said Tagaloa.\n\nThe inquiry narrates accounts from survivors who were subjected to abuse and torture including rape, sterilisation and electric shocks in state and faith-based care.\n\nThose from the Indigenous Maori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, the report found, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.\n\nAnna Thompson, a survivor, told the commission how she was physically and verbally abused at a faith-based orphanage.\n\n\"At night, the nuns would strip my clothes off, tie me to the bed face-down, and thrash me with a belt with the buckle. It cut into my skin until I bled and I couldn't sit down afterwards for weeks,\" Thompson said in her testimony published in the report.\n\nJesse Kett spoke of how he was beaten and raped by staff in a residential school in Auckland when he was eight years old.\n\n\"Sometimes my abuser would be alone, but sometimes other staff members would watch,\" he said in his testimony to the inquiry.\n\nSeveral of the testimonies spoke of the impact the abuse had on their lives -- many suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, depression, anxiety and resorted to substance abuse and violence. Several of them spoke of attempting suicide repeatedly.\n\n\"Just the trauma of the memories of abuse they live with you all the time and you can get by the simplest of things every days,\" said Tagaloa, who is now working to help other survivors.\n\nTagaloa said the establishment of the inquiry was an opportunity for her to tell her story. She has also been involved both in a survivor advisory role with the inquiry and now with the Survivor Experiences Service, which was set up to allow survivors to share their experiences.\n\nThe report recommended a transformation in the care given for children in schools, the care of the vulnerable and those with disabilities and Maori and Pasifika.\n\n\"I just think it's a pathway for survivors to be able to get redress and it's a pathway that will protect our children and our vulnerable for the future,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Lucy Craymer; editing by Praveen Menon and Michael Perry)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagaloa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tagaloa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Thompson_(runner)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Thompson (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anglicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphanage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orphanage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Perry_(triple_jumper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Perry (triple jumper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasifika_New_Zealanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasifika New Zealanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Indian residential school system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Ritual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Ritual Abuse", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 38}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Many survivors died while they were in care or by suicide following care. For others, the impacts of abuse are ongoing and compounding, making everyday activities and choices challenging,\" said Arrun Soma, an advisor of the commission, on July 24.\n\n\"Faith-based institutions had some unique factors that contributed to abuse and neglect in their care,\" he said.\n\n\"The assumed moral authority and trustworthiness of clergy and religious leaders allowed abusers in faith-based institutions to perpetrate abuse and neglect with impunity. Religious beliefs were often used to justify the abuse and neglect, and to silence survivors. Hierarchical and opaque decision-making processes impeded scrutiny and making complaints,\" Soma continued.\n\nHe said in faith-based care settings, abuse was treated as a religious transgression that required survivors to forgive, let go of anger and blame, and instead embrace those who had sinned against them; and abusers to merely repent.\n\n\"Many abusers were relocated and went on to continue abusing people in care,\" he added.\n\nThe report said as many as 42 percent of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused.\n\nThe Catholic Church in New Zealand itself said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14 percent of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nThe report also called for an investigation of Catholic priests from New Zealand and Australia sent to Papua New Guinea after suffering accusations of abuse.\n\nIn his comments on Wednesday, Soma said New Zealand's care system is broken.\n\n\"Survivors want to see a total overhaul and fundamental change to ensure that this national catastrophe does not continue,\" he said.\n\nHe also said faith-based institutions should \"exit the business of care and in their pastoral care adopt national standards and transparent complaint processes.\"\n\n\"In faith-based institutions, leaders providing pastoral care reflect the diversity of their communities and expression of that diversity is welcomed,\" he added. \"Faith community members are free to choose partners, seek appropriate health care and have no fear of being shunned.\"\n\nIn a statement, the New Zealand Catholic Bishops Conference (NZCBC) said it has \"received a copy of the Inquiry's Final Report and will now read and review it carefully.\"\n\n\"There is work for the government to do and work to be undertaken by many other people. We understand that within the community, some of us - including leaders in the Catholic Church - have a special role to play to ensure that the findings and recommendations of this significant Inquiry are not lost or confined to words in a report. We commit to that role,\" said the statement signed by Bishop Steve Lowe, the president of the NZCBC.\n\n\"There are things that all of us can and must do to eliminate abuse of any kind in whatever context we live and work in. We hope this report and the work that flows from it will result in a better society and a safer environment for all people,\" the bishops' statement said.\n\n\"Over the past 30 years, the Catholic Church in Aotearoa New Zealand has made significant progress in responding to reports of abuse and safeguarding.

Abuse and neglect were widespread ... in state and faith-based care institutions,\" the commissioners said.\n\n\"Any abuse and neglect, let alone the prevalence of it, could not be justified by the standards of the day and certainly cannot be justified now.\n\n\"Critical rights, such as those guaranteed to M\u0101ori in te Tiriti o Waitangi and human rights, that should have protected people in care, were ignored and overlooked altogether.\"\n\nThe commissioners made 138 recommendations to right the wrongs of the past; ensure the safety of every child, young person and adult in care today; and to empower and invest in wh\u0101nau and communities.\n\nThey included the establishment of a specialist investigation unit, an independent Care Safe Agency to oversee the care system and a Care System Office, which would later become the Ministry for the Care System, to lead the implementation of the royal commission's recommendations.\n\nThe commissioners also called for the government to \"prioritise and accelerate current work to close care and protection residences, which perpetuate the institutional environments and practices\".\n\n\"Of the estimated 655,000 children, young people and adults in care from 1950 to 2019, it is estimated that 200,000 were abused and even more were neglected,\" the report said.\n\n\"The true number will never be fully known as records of the most vulnerable people in Aotearoa New Zealand were never created or were lost and, in some cases, destroyed.\n\n\"It is a national disgrace that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the State and faith-based institutions.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family. If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever.\"\n\nThe report called for public apologies and accountability from the prime minister, faith leaders, public sector leaders, leaders of relevant professional bodies, leaders of care providers and leaders of faith-based institutions.\n\nRead more:\n\n\"An apology is hollow without change.

The steps the government has taken to date are inconsistent in important respects with the recommendations of the inquiry.\n\n\"Many survivors in Aotearoa New Zealand continue to have no effective remedy, and the puretumu torowh\u0101nui system which the inquiry recommended has not been implemented.\"\n\nThe commissioners described survivors facing a second or third-class system in Aotearoa New Zealand compared with Australia.\n\n\"Unless significant change occurs, this will continue to be the case.\n\n\"Meaningful reform which provides fair, holistic and comprehensive redress will inevitably be expensive for the government and faith-based institutions.\n\n\"The alternative is for many survivors and their wh\u0101nau, and society at large, to continue bearing these costs, despite the abuse having taken place in state and faith-based care and the survivors not being at fault.\"\n\nSurvivors could also pursue a civil litigation process or other means for compensation or settlements, \"which are far beyond anything currently available in Aotearoa New Zealand including through the accident compensation scheme\", the commissioners said.\n\n\"The question is not whether these things can be done, but whether New Zealanders want to ensure survivors of abuse and neglect receive holistic redress that recompenses them for what happened, and the lost economic opportunities and loss of life enjoyment, and in particular whether government wants to do them.\n\n\"Survivors have been told that they matter, they are respected for their courage, and they have been heard. Some apologies have been given, and a national apology is being planned.\n\n\"The inquiry considers much more needs to be done, mostly led by the government. And government needs to act promptly so that survivors do not continue to die without receiving effective, holistic redress.\"\n\nThe commissioners called for urgent action to address the \"systemic and deeply embedded\" harm caused at all levels of care.\n\n\"The findings call for a complete overhaul of Aotearoa New Zealand's state and faith-based care systems in social welfare, disability, mental health, education, and transitional and law enforcement and pastoral care settings.\n\n\"The recommendations comprise mutually reinforcing strands woven together into a k\u0101kahu (cloak) to right the wrongs of the past and protect against abuse and neglect in care in the future.\n\n\"These recommendations cannot be selectively implemented - missing out any of the strands will create gaps and points of weakness in the k\u0101kahu which mean the cycles of abuse and neglect in care will continue.\n\n\"Abuse and neglect in care does not just harm individuals - it imposes a significant burden on wh\u0101nau, kainga and society.

Several of them spoke of attempting suicide repeatedly.\n\n\"Just the trauma of the memories of abuse they live with you all the time and you can get by the simplest of things every days,\" said Tagaloa, who is now working to help other survivors.\n\nTagaloa said the establishment of the inquiry was an opportunity for her to tell her story. She has also been involved both in a survivor advisory role with the inquiry and now with the Survivor Experiences Service, which was set up to allow survivors to share their experiences.\n\nThe report recommended a transformation in the care given for children in schools, the care of the vulnerable and those with disabilities and Maori and Pasifika.\n\n\"I just think it's a pathway for survivors to be able to get redress and it's a pathway that will protect our children and our vulnerable for the future,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@deccanherald.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagaloa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tagaloa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anglicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous Australians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphanage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orphanage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasifika_New_Zealanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasifika New Zealanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Indian residential school system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2024-07%2Fc2da81ba-d4f9-4bf8-bb8c-cd036661338a%2FiStock-1139822596.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C2121%2C1114&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

And, as you might guess, religion is a huge part of the problem.\n\n\"This is a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history as a society and as a state, we should have done better, and I am determined that we will do so,\" Mr Luxon told a news conference after its release.\n\nIn short, the report found that about 200,000 people were abused over the course of seven decades. (That's in a country with a current population of only 5 million.) Many of the organizations -- both state-run and religious -- got away with it because of an overwhelming lack of oversight.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019... nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher, though precise numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the M\u0101ori and English names for the country.\n\nThe report also found that the \"average cost of abuse\" for survivors amounted to about $857,000 ($508,000 in USD), including health care, suffering, opportunity costs, and premature death.\n\nWhile the government will be offering a formal apology in November, it's not clear which, if any, of the 138 recommendations for moving forward they will adopt -- including payments to survivors.\n\nIn the meantime, though, we can look at what the report found regarding the larger religious groups, like the Catholic Church:\n\nThe report singled out churches -- particularly the Catholic Church -- as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.\n\nWhen allegations are made against 14% of a workforce, there's no way to blame a couple of rogue members. The problem in the Catholic Church is systemic. Consider the fact that, according to the report, several priests who were convicted of sexual abuse were sent by the Church to Australia or Papua New Guinea. They were allowed to start fresh in a place where their crimes weren't known.\n\n[Royal Commission advisor Arrun Soma] also said faith-based institutions should \"exit the business of care and in their pastoral care adopt national standards and transparent complaint processes.\"\n\n\"In faith-based institutions, leaders providing pastoral care reflect the diversity of their communities and expression of that diversity is welcomed,\" he added. \"Faith community members are free to choose partners, seek appropriate health care and have no fear of being shunned.\"\n\nChurch officials said they were reviewing the report and would issue a response after they were done. (Don't hold your breath.)\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses didn't fare much better. In fact, the JWs actually went to court to prevent the section about them from being made public, but they lost that battle. The resulting 64-page case study into that one group is a troubling read.\n\nIt blames, among other things, the power held by Elders, \"high barriers\" when it came to disclosing abuse, \"the inferior position of women within the faith,\" the fear of being disfellowshipped, horrible record-keeping, and the existence of the \"Two-Witness rule\" (which says church elders shouldn't take a victim's account of abuse seriously unless another person witnessed it... even though the only other person around may have been the abuser himself).\n\nPerhaps the most damning passage in the report is this one which says the JWs defended their actions by insisting they never took care of children:\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' approach to this Inquiry and to its activities was premised on the basis that no children or young people were ever in its care. The ongoing failure of the faith to recognise that children and young people were in its care gives the Inquiry concern about the faith's overall approach to the safety of children and young people in its care during the Inquiry period.\n\nThe JWs acted like, since they didn't run a formal daycare, they couldn't be blamed for what happened to children under their watch. The Commission was right to call out that kind of negligence. Just consider what the JWs did to Jasmine Grew, one woman who went on record and spoke with authorities about how her religious leaders handled her own account of abuse:\n\nJasmine Grew told the Inquiry that she had disclosed abuse to her mother in 1989, when she was 12 years old. Her mother told the Elders of her congregation \"as she was expected\" to do. Soon after at a faith meeting, an Elder came up to Jasmine and said \"we'd like to speak to you in the back room\":\n\n\"I went back into the back room and the elders (male) were there. I had no support, no friend, no mother, nothing. My mother did not know, at the time, what was happening.\"\n\n...\n\nJasmine Grew said, \"They put the blame on me. They said I was wearing seductive clothing. I was aged from five to eight years old at the time [he] was sexually abusing me.\"\n\n...\n\n\"... The elders interrogated me. They were asking the worst questions you can imagine, for someone who was just 12 years old. They asked me, 'Was it hard,' referring to my abuser physically. They wanted to know everything. Their questions were inappropriate. At that age it was a terrifying experience for me. It seemed as abusive as the sexual abuse itself ... I was honest, and I told them everything because I had to be honest. I was fearful of the consequences of Armageddon.\"\n\nHer story seems sadly typical. JW leaders took care of abuse by talking to minors without their parents present, then used religious threats to get them to keep quiet. It worked. The abuse remained a secret for years if not decades.\n\nThe Inquiry has not seen any evidence of the Jehovah's Witnesses referring sexual abuse allegations to police during the Inquiry period in Aotearoa New Zealand. This is consistent with Inquiry findings in Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 364-page \"Future\" section offers recommendations regarding how to move forward. When it comes to the religious institutions, the options are limited... but the document calls on various religious leaders -- including the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Governing Body of JWs -- to issue formal apologies.\n\nI don't know who would benefit from such an apology but it would at least acknowledge those institutions' roles in facilitating the abuse. Right now, may of them are just trying to wipe their hands clean of all of it. In addition to the apologies, the faith-based groups were asked to consider working with an agency dedicated to safety or oversight bodies... but there's no punishment if they don't.\n\nThat's why, more than anything, it's the public shaming that may have a greater effect on the institutions than anything else. People should know their families may not be safe in a faith-based group and that those leaders have a long-standing habit of denying abuse exists. Better to avoid religious groups entirely than put your kids at risk.", "source": {"uri": "friendlyatheist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Friendly Atheist"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hemant_mehta@friendlyatheist.com", "name": "Hemant Mehta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patreon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jehovah's Witnesses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastoral care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(Christianity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elder (Christianity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excommunication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church sexual abuse cases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_humiliation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public humiliation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armageddon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Ffriendlyatheist.substack.com%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fpost_preview%2F146965016%2Ftwitter.jpg%3Fversion%3D4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The authors said it is the widest-ranging exploration of abuse and neglect of people in care ever conducted worldwide. They decried the widespread abuse and neglect of hundreds of thousands of people in care between 1950 and 1999 as a \"national disgrace\" and made 138 recommendations.\n\nPrevious New Zealand governments had resisted holding such an inquiry.\n\nOther countries have conducted similar investigations over the past two decades. Among them:\n\n- Australia held two recent inquiries into the abuse of children and disabled people. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse ran from 2012-2017 and scrutinized public, church and private institutions - including child care, cultural, educational, religious, sporting and other organizations. Then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison made an emotional public apology in 2018 for the systemic sexual abuse of children in Australia. A second Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability operated from 2019-2023, examining mistreatment of disabled people in all areas of society.\n\n- Two decades earlier, Australia investigated its systematic removal of Indigenous children from their families in the report \"Bringing Them Home,\" which followed a national inquiry from 1995-1997 into the so-called Stolen Generations of young Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders taken by the state between 1910 and 1970 - thought to be between 10% and 30% of all such children. Then-Prime Minister John Howard rejected the report's call for a national apology, but a later Australian leader, Kevin Rudd, gave one in 2008.\n\nPeople arrive at Parliament in Wellington, New Zealand, on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, for the tabling of a wide-ranging independent inquiry into the abuse of children and vulnerable adults in care over the span of five decades wrote in a blistering final report. (AP Photo/Charlotte Graham-McLay)\n\n- Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission extended from 2007-2015 and examined individual and collective harms perpetrated against Aboriginal people between 1883 and 1996 in government-funded, church-run residential schools, where 150,000 children were placed. Sexual abuse and religious indoctrination were rife. Pope Francis in 2022 apologized for the Catholic Church\u00b4s involvement with Canada\u00b4s \"catastrophic\" policy of Indigenous residential schools, one of several he has made for the church's transgressions against children in care settings around the world.\n\n- In 2022, the United States Interior Department released a first-of-its-kind federal study of Native American boarding schools that for over a century sought to assimilate Indigenous children into white society and undercut their cultural and tribal ties. It identified more than 500 student deaths at more than 400 schools that were established or supported by the U.S. government. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary, acknowledged the boarding school era perpetuated poverty, mental health disorders, substance abuse and premature deaths in Indigenous communities.\n\n- In England and Wales, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse ranged from 2015-2022, examining abuse and exploitation in state institutions - including police, government departments, schools, health services and custodial institutions - and non-state institutions, including religious organizations and private schools. It covered abuse that happened \"in living memory.\"\n\n- The Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry covered the physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children between 1922 and 1995. It ran 2013-2017 and examined abuse in state and non-state residential institutions, including religious institutions and excluding schools.\n\n- Ireland's Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse ranged from 2000 until 2009, and initially scrutinized physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children that happened between 1940 and 1999 - before it was extended to reach back as far as 1914. It covered a comprehensive list of state and religious-run institutions, although it excluded the notorious Magdalene Laundries, where 10,000 so-called fallen women were consigned and forced to undertake menial labor. A government apology to the women was made in 2013. Pope Francis apologized to the tens of thousands of women and children abused in the Catholic Church's care in 2018.\n\n- The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry began in 2015 and is ongoing. It covers abuse in living memory that happened in a wide-ranging list of state or non-state institutions, including faith-based groups.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u00b4s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The abuse was physical, emotional, mental and sexual - and there was severe exploitation and neglect.\n\n\"At the heart of this report are the stories of 2400 survivors - many of whom are here today,\" Luxon said in Parliament to a packed public gallery.\n\n\"To every person who took part, I say thank you for your exceptional strength, your incredible courage, and your confronting honesty.\n\n\"Because of you, we know the truth about the abuse and trauma you have endured.\n\n\"I cannot take away your pain, but I can tell you this: You are heard and you are believed.\"\n\nLuxon has formally acknowledged the abuse experienced by some at Lake Alice Hospital, a psychiatric facility, was \"torture\". Patients were given electric shocks without anaesthetic and painful and immobilising paraldehyde injections, he said.\n\n\"Today, I humbly stand before you in this house to offer a long overdue apology to the survivors of Lake Alice. I am sorry that it has taken so long for this acknowledgement of torture.\"\n\nPoliticians debated the report in Parliament yesterday afternoon with a series of emotional and impassioned speeches - and calls to ensure changes are made so such accounts of abuse never happen again.\n\nIn the House, Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said her party would not stop trying to make change to prevent further harm - \"until our last breath goes out\".\n\nShe implored those affected to leave the mamae (pain) of the experiences with the House of Parliament, where the report was tabled. She urged the survivors in the public gallery to \"unshackle the weight of the trauma\" and \"leave it here\".\n\n\"Do not leave here without dumping that mamae that you have had to carry and pass on.\n\n\"The fact that those who targeted our people - because they were M\u0101ori. They were Takat\u0101pui, they were T\u0101ngata Whaikaha, they were Tangata Turi and they were poor - that's why we were targeted. What the hell has changed?\"\n\n\"We should be working with the lived experiences and learn from it - otherwise all of this is just lip service.\"\n\nThe Green Party has called on the Government to do \"all it can\" to bring abuse in care to an end, saying: \"\"We cannot let history repeat itself.\"\n\n\"We must learn from our mistakes and bring abuse in care to an end,\" Green Party Spokesperson for Children Kahurangi Carter said.\n\n\"The difficult journeys and harrowing testimonies from survivors who contributed to the Royal Commission of Inquiry cannot be ignored. It is incumbent on the Government to listen and learn from their stories.\"\n\nChildren's Minister Karen Chhour described the perpetrators of the abuse as \"monsters\" who used their positions of authority \"both as a weapon and a shield.\n\n\"We must take a long, hard look at not only the perpetrators, but those who enabled this abuse to continue for so long but chose to look the other way.\n\n\"If you see something, say something. Too many of us have failed and still to this day are failing to do this.\"\n\nThere must be change, she said, adding that she could not say \"hand on heart\" that young people are no longer being hurt in care.\n\n\"We will address it immediately - to not do so is unacceptable.\"\n\nLuxon acknowledged the previous Government which commenced this important inquiry almost six years ago.\n\n\"A terrible injustice was done in the name of State care. It is now the responsibility of the State to make redress and this Government will ensure it happens.\"\n\nLabour Leader Chris Hipkins described the abuse as \"a disgraceful part of our history\" with far-reaching and intergenerational consequences that had affected people for decades.\n\n\"I want to acknowledge the thousands of survivors, those who've given their time, energy and stories to the inquiry, and those who have died before this report was able to be finalised.\n\n\"There will never be closure for some, but I hope that today offers some relief for survivors - that their fight to be heard has resulted in a formal apology and redress.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electroconvulsive therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_P\u0101ti_M\u0101ori", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Ngarewa-Packer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debbie Ngarewa-Packer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takat\u0101pui", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Takat\u0101pui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraldehyde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paraldehyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Alice_(Gainesville,_Florida)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Alice (Gainesville, Florida)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Chhour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen Chhour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Aotearoa_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hipkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hipkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/ZCKQZONQXVCV3NN7K2WN2YBFKA.jpg?auth=d1ff88eb8520ee51797c0cd5437c147fc92e952d67c41c862e35fb4bf608b50d&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 83, "textEnd": 94}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

A 2020 briefing from the Catholic Church previously noted abuse accusations against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during those decades.\n\nThe report details different forms of abuse occurring in a variety of institutions, including physical, emotional, mental, and sexual, as well as cultural neglect and racism against the indigenous M\u0101ori of New Zealand.\n\nThe commission found that the Catholic Church relied \"heavily on psychiatrists' opinions, leading to transferring abusers to other areas of ministry where they re-offended.\" In addition, it also found the Church at fault for prioritizing its \"reputation over safety\" and the creation of a \"power imbalance between clergy and parishioners.\"\n\nThe commission noted that there was a \"lack of resources and investment in those caring for children and vulnerable individuals\" in Catholic institutions.\n\n\"Faith-based institutions had some unique factors that contributed to abuse and neglect in their care,\" Soma said. \"The assumed moral authority and trustworthiness of clergy and religious leaders allowed abusers in faith-based institutions to perpetrate abuse and neglect with impunity.\"\n\n\"Religious beliefs were often used to justify the abuse and neglect, and to silence survivors,\" he continued. \"Hierarchical and opaque decision-making processes impeded scrutiny and making complaints.\"\n\nFrom the more than 2,300 survivors who spoke with investigators, there was \"a higher proportion of survivors in faith settings than in state care [who] were sexually abused,\" the report read. Investigators found that \"the highest reported levels of sexual abuse\" were at Dilworth School in T\u0101maki Makaurau Auckland, an Anglican institution, as well as Marylands School in \u014ctautahi Christchurch, a Catholic institute, and \"at Catholic institutions in general.\"\n\n\"In faith-based care settings, abuse was treated as a religious transgression that required survivors to forgive, let go of anger and blame, and instead embrace those who had sinned against them; and abusers to merely repent,\" Soma noted. \"Many abusers were relocated and went on to continue abusing people in care.\"\n\nThe New Zealand Conference of Catholic Bishops thanked the commission for its report in a July 24 statement and promised to take action following its review of the findings.\n\n\"We hope this report and the work that flows from it will result in a better society and a safer environment for all people,\" read the statement by Bishop Steve Lowe, head of the bishops. \"Abuse is not only historical, nor confined to one part of society or another. The inquiry's report and the material that we heard from victims and survivors make that crystal clear.\"\n\n\"Over the past 30 years, the Catholic Church in Aotearoa New Zealand has made significant progress in responding to reports of abuse and safeguarding,\" the bishops continued. \"We must continue to work to ensure that progress continues and that our church communities are places where people are safe.\"\n\n(Story continues below)\n\nThe commission recommended that New Zealand seek apologies from state and Church leaders, including Pope Francis. The report also called for an investigation into Catholic priests who were transferred to Papua New Guinea after abuse allegations.\n\nThe New Zealand investigation is notably the most wide-ranging investigation into abuse and neglect undertaken worldwide, according to its leadership.

They condemned the extensive abuse and neglect of hundreds of thousands of individuals in care from 1950 to 1999 as a \"national disgrace\" and proposed 138 recommendations for action.\n\nPrevious New Zealand governments had resisted holding such an inquiry. Other countries have conducted similar investigations over the past two decades. Among them:\n\n-- Australia held two recent inquiries into the abuse of children and disabled people. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse ran from 2012-2017 and scrutinized public, church and private institutions -- including child care, cultural, educational, religious, sporting and other organizations. Then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison made an emotional public apology in 2018 for the systemic sexual abuse of children in Australia. A second Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability operated from 2019-2023, examining mistreatment of disabled people in all areas of society.\n\n-- Two decades earlier, Australia investigated its systematic removal of Indigenous children from their families in the report \"Bringing Them Home,\" which followed a national inquiry from 1995-1997 into the so-called Stolen Generations of young Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders taken by the state between 1910 and 1970 -- thought to be between 10% and 30% of all such children. Then-Prime Minister John Howard rejected the report's call for a national apology, but a later Australian leader, Kevin Rudd, gave one in 2008.\n\n-- Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission extended from 2007-2015 and examined individual and collective harms perpetrated against Aboriginal people between 1883 and 1996 in government-funded, church-run residential schools, where 150,000 children were placed. Sexual abuse and religious indoctrination were rife. Pope Francis in 2022 apologized for the Catholic Church's involvement with Canada's \"catastrophic\" policy of Indigenous residential schools, one of several he has made for the church's transgressions against children in care settings around the world.\n\n-- In 2022, the United States Interior Department released a first-of-its-kind federal study of Native American boarding schools that for over a century sought to assimilate Indigenous children into white society and undercut their cultural and tribal ties. It identified more than 500 student deaths at more than 400 schools that were established or supported by the U.S. government. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary, acknowledged the boarding school era perpetuated poverty, mental health disorders, substance abuse and premature deaths in Indigenous communities.\n\n-- In England and Wales, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse ranged from 2015-2022, examining abuse and exploitation in state institutions -- including police, government departments, schools, health services and custodial institutions -- and non-state institutions, including religious organizations and private schools. It covered abuse that happened \"in living memory.\"\n\n-- The Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry covered the physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children between 1922 and 1995. It ran 2013-2017 and examined abuse in state and non-state residential institutions, including religious institutions and excluding schools.\n\n-- Ireland's Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse ranged from 2000 until 2009, and initially scrutinized physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children that happened between 1940 and 1999 -- before it was extended to reach back as far as 1914. It covered a comprehensive list of state and religious-run institutions, although it excluded the notorious Magdalene Laundries, where 10,000 so-called fallen women were consigned and forced to undertake menial labor. A government apology to the women was made in 2013.

This conclusion came after a six-year investigation by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care, which examined cases from 1950 to the present.\n\nThe commission's final report described the abuse as \"unimaginable\" within both state and religious institutions, revealing that at least 200,000 people had been abused in these care settings over the decades. The report, presented to New Zealand's Governor-General on June 25 and then to Parliament on July 24, highlighted the lifelong impact of abuse on survivors.\n\n\"Abuse and neglect in care have had lifelong consequences for survivors. Many have died under care or committed suicide afterward. For others, the impacts are ongoing and compound daily challenges,\" stated Arrun Soma, an advisor to the commission, on July 24.\n\nSoma emphasized that religious institutions had unique factors that contributed to the abuse. \"The assumed moral authority and reliability of clergy and religious leaders enabled abusers within these institutions to act with impunity. Religious beliefs were often used to justify the abuse and to silence survivors. Hierarchical and opaque decision-making processes obstructed scrutiny and reporting,\" he said.\n\nIn faith-based care settings, abuse was often framed as a religious transgression, requiring survivors to forgive their abusers and suppress their anger and guilt. Many abusers were simply relocated and continued their misconduct elsewhere. The report noted that up to 42 percent of individuals in religious care across denominations were victims of abuse.\n\nThe Catholic Church in New Zealand acknowledged during a 2020 briefing that allegations had been made against 14 percent of its clergy during the investigation period. The report also called for an investigation into New Zealand and Australian Catholic priests sent to Papua New Guinea after abuse allegations.\n\nSoma criticized the broken state of New Zealand's care system and called for a comprehensive overhaul to prevent further national catastrophe. He urged religious institutions to withdraw from providing care and adopt transparent national standards and complaint processes in their pastoral care.\n\nIn response, the New Zealand Catholic Bishops Conference (NZCBC) issued a statement: \"We have received a copy of the Final Report and will read and review it carefully. The government has much work to do, and many others, including Church leaders, have a special role in ensuring the findings and recommendations are acted upon.\" The statement, signed by Bishop Steve Lowe, NZCBC president, emphasized the Church's commitment to eradicating abuse and ensuring safe communities.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the Catholic Church in New Zealand has made significant strides in responding to abuse allegations and protecting children's rights. The Church vows to continue improving and ensuring its communities are safe places.\n\nSoma concluded with a stark reminder of the enduring trauma faced by sexual abuse survivors, impacting their ability to maintain healthy relationships and leading to emotional and psychological isolation. He stressed that everyone in New Zealand must play a role in preventing abuse, ensuring harmful beliefs are challenged, and abusers are identified and stopped.", "source": {"uri": "zenit.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZENIT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor-General of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church in New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moral authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Children's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastoral care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Papua New Guinea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://zenit.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/protest-ahead-of-publication-of-royal-commission-into-care-abuse-report-in-parliament-01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 54, "textEnd": 61, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 689, "textEnd": 696}], "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

I regret that that is not something that we can give you today, but it is a priority for the government in the coming months.\"\n\nHe thanked the nearly 2400 submitters \"for your exceptional strength, your incredible courage, and your confronting honesty ... because of you, we know the truth about the abuse and trauma you have endured.\"\n\n\"Many of your stories are horrific and harrowing. They are painful to read, but not as painful as they were to endure. The state was supposed to care for you - but instead many of you were subjected to the most horrendous physical, emotional, mental, and sexual abuse.\"\n\nHe acknowledged they had been failed by the institutions they should have been able to trust, and were ignored or denied when they tried to seek justice, noting M\u0101ori, Pacific, deaf and disabled people disproportionately bore the brunt.\n\n\"I want to assure you that we understand the urgency and importance of this work and we will provide clarity before the end of the year.\"\n\nHowever, he also emphasised that while action would come \"it cannot be rushed\", pointing ahead to the formal apology set down for 12 November and the ministerial group to be headed by lead minister Erica Stanford.\n\nHe also thanked the Commissioners and staff who worked on the inquiry, acknowledged the previous Labour government for beginning it nearly six years earlier, and again thanked survivors for their bravery.\n\n\"I will never lose sight of what you have endured to bring the truth to life,\" he said, before closing with a karakia written by Waihoroi Shortland who worked on the inquiry.\n\n\"To you upon whom this inquiry has been centred, resolute in your pursuit of justice, relentless in your belief for life, we have only our highest regard and respect, may your peace of mind be assured.\"\n\nLabour leader Hipkins acknowledged survivors' strength, courage and perseverance.\n\n\"Many of you have dedicated your lives to this fight and many of you have dedicated your lives to protecting and being a voice for future generations, so that they do not have to endure what you have. We see you, we hear you, and we thank you.\"\n\nHe said while a formal apology was still some time away \"we are sorry, as a society and a country we are sorry\".\n\nHipkins said New Zealand owed an enormous debt to the survivors, with the Royal Commission having shone a light on a \"nationwide intergenerational shame for New Zealand\".\n\nHe could not imagine how it would feel being told as a child nobody loved them, and to then have those entrusted to care for them \"to set about demonstrating that through their actions, I cannot imagine the trauma, the lifelong trauma, that would have inflicted\".\n\nHe pointed to the targeting of M\u0101ori, Pasifika, and disabled people, highlighting a quote from the report which said the abuse had one thing in common: \"they devalued and dehumanised children, young people and adults in care\".\n\n\"Those words are a siren call to all of us today, they are a ruler that we should measure our actions today against, because the abuse in state care is not over,\" he said, to raucous applause from survivors in the public gallery.\n\nHe also referred to a quote from Dr Rawiri Waratini-Karena from the beginning of the report, saying that at age 18 never having been to prison before, he knew 45 of the 50 men in the prison yard and knew there was a pipeline to prison process in care.\n\nHipkins thanked Luxon for his words, and admitted Labour had fallen short in its own response.\n\n\"Prime Minister, we didn't do enough, and the ball now falls to you and your government. This must be bigger than politics.\"\n\nHe ended with a lengthy homage to those who did not survive, a quote from the Royal Commission on how they began their report: \"To you who came to us with nothing in your hands, with sorrow clouding your hearts ... while your voices are now silent, your words will endure, rest in peace, and in that peace we hope you find solace in this report\".\n\nGreen co-leader Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick said she wanted to acknowledge the wight of history, resilience, and the potential for healing, saying words could not convey the failures and injustices of the state.\n\n\"But words do matter, they are something to be held accountable to ... let it be clear that we in the Greens are so, so deeply sorry.\"\n\nShe said she had spoken to some survivors who had asked if there would be a formal welcome to Parliament, and had personally handed a letter from one to the prime minister.\n\nSurvivors had told her they wanted two things on the record: the apology, and to identify what redress and justice looks like. The next step would be an apology outside of the institution of Parliament, \"to come to survivors, not to continue to ask survivors to come to us\".\n\nThey had also said they wanted her to be clear the abuse had not stopped in 1999, which is where the Royal Commission's scope ends, she said.\n\nSwarbrick also highlighted the disproportionate targeting of members of minorities, including with girls and women placed in faith-based homes - their babies taken away and adopted out and for M\u0101ori legally severing their ties to whakapapa.\n\n\"That harm did not just happen in state care in the form of immense and devastating physical and sexual abuse, it stayed with the people and in some cases it multiplied. That harm was the seed that grew gangs in this country and the state responded largely by compounding that harm.\"\n\nIt was most obviously visible today in prisons, she said, which also failed victims and offenders \"by producing more crime, not less\".\n\n\"We need to reconcile that this abuse and the consequences of this abuse are not historic ... it is built into the fabric of the way that our state has worked since colonisation in this country established this Parliament.\"\n\nShe said there must be financial redress, but more than that: \"this apology must transcend into ensuring that no people are ever subjected to this at the hand of the state ever again\".\n\n\"What that means, and what survivors this morning told us, is that that means no military-style boot camps,\" she said, to cheers and applause. She also called for section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act to be retained, before ending with the refrain:\n\n\"At the end of the day, what is the most important thing in the world? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata, it is people, it is people, it is people.\"\n\nACT's Karen Chhour acknowledged those who were no longer living, who \"left this world only knowing the horrors they experienced, the cruelty and the unbearable treatment that they received, and my heart goes out to them\", before also acknowledging those watching.\n\nChhour is also the lead minister for the government's boot camps policy, and a cry of 'shame' had come down from the public gallery as she stood. A call of \"no boot camps\" could also be heard later on in her speech.\n\nBut Chhour is also the only sitting MP who experienced the care system first hand, and delivered her speech with passion and sorrow.\n\n\"The fact that so many offenders were able to victimise and harm, repeatedly for years on end, negatively impacting countless children and their families for generations long past their own lifetimes is devastating and unacceptable,\" she said, growing visibly emotional.\n\n\"These monsters used their positions of authority both as a weapon and a shield.\"\n\nApplause rang out as she said a long hard look was needed - not only at the perpetrators but those who enabled the abuse by looking the other way. More applause and cheers as she said it was unacceptable to remove a child from harm, only to place them somewhere that was equally unsafe or worse.\n\nChhour also paid tribute to survivors who had later become Oranga Tamariki workers to fight for change from the inside.\n\n\"We need the care system as a whole for children and for adults across all settings and environments to become increasingly safer for those who need it.\"\n\n\"I have my own personal trauma related to dealing with state care, and this report affects me deeply. I am filled with compassion for the hardships and trauma that so many have endured and have continued to suffer from .... it is time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside.\"\n\nShe said what had happened was clearly unacceptable and the state had tolerated rape and misuse of power for far too long.\n\n\"This did not just happen in a few isolated cases or situations. The abuse was systematic, continuous, and sadly normalised ... it is important that we act decisively and honour the courage of these victims and survivors by making sure that something like this never happens again.\"\n\nMP Casey Costello spoke for NZ First, saying the report had captured the nation's attention and she hoped those gathered at Parliament would feel that place \"is not talking about you, but that we are representing you.\n\n\"No matter your politics, no matter your party affiliations or political outlook, I believe every member in this chamber knows that the key role fo the state is to protect our most vulnerable. Every society should be judged by how we care for and protect those who need it most.\n\n\"This report is our judgement ... as a society and as the Crown, we should have done better.\"\n\nShe said it was clear to her all the parties were united in wanting to make a difference in the wake of the report.\n\nCostello also spoke of her time as a police officer, saying she had looked into the eyes of many victims and \"I still see those eyes and I see those faces whether it was child who had been the victim of recent abuse ... or whether it was a grown adult who was recounting the pain from many years ago\".\n\n\"In some way it helps me understand what it must have been like for those who have shared their experiences in the report,\" she said.\n\nLike the tortured little boy who she had once seen show an \"absolute shining light of joy\" after being given a lollipop by a nurse, it was small interventions which could have brought survivors joy, she said.\n\n\"Perhaps today as we speak and recognise the strength, resilience, perseverance and courage, there will be some light.\"\n\nSimilar to Luxon, she said the response to the report six years in the making needed to be considered with respect and care.\n\n\"It will have been hard and painful to share your story, it has been hard and painful to read it, however you must know that after we all leave this place, when we have taken the action agreed and delivered what is needed your story will never fade out. We have heard your voice, we have seen your face and felt your pain. Today you have changed lives, moved hearts, and opened eyes.\"\n\nAfter beginning in te reo M\u0101ori, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said she wanted to mihi to those who were brave and gave their stories to the report, and those who never could.\n\n\"Arrive here and unshackle the weight... of everything you have carried and had to listen to. This is not the place for your rongo\u0101, the place for your rongo\u0101 is in your moana, by your maunga, by your awa, by your hap\u016b, by your marae.\n\n\"This is the place where you lay your mamae and you leave it here, you leave it here with those with a forked tongue.\"\n\nShe said she had to hear how people had been targeted because they were M\u0101ori, takat\u0101pui, tangata whaikaha, tangata turi or poor, and \"you listen to the richness of all the k\u014drero today but what the hell has changed for us?\"\n\nShe said the Crown must be held accountable for the abuse \"because it is criminal, and it is criminal negligence ... there must be consequences\".\n\nShe told survivors not to accept that the report must be digested slowly.\n\n\"For cripes sake, my mokopuna can see what's needed.\"\n\nShe related the experiences of a long list of survivors and their experiences.\n\n\"Nothing learned, all of these experiences have been shared ... yet here we are in a government which is saying how sorry it is but it continues to create mega-prisons, removes 7AA of Oranga Tamariki and experiments with our rangatahi in justice in boot camps.\"\n\nShe said the authorities should be learning from the report, \"otherwise all of this is just lip service that looks really great for the international governments\".\n\n\"So we will not stop until the last of our breath goes out and I can sit here and I can say that this place stops creating harm for not just our people but all of our people and all of our mokopuna.\"\n\nThe report includes findings of widespread sexual, financial, and cultural abuse against about 30 percent of the 655,000 children, young people and adults in care from 1950 to 2019.\n\nIt details neglect and violence against those people, typically from the first day they were placed in care and for their entire experience of it. M\u0101ori and Pacific people were stripped of their culture, and disabled people were stripped of their dignity and autonomy.\n\nSexual abuse, medical abuse, solitary confinement, and conditions akin to slavery were all used as tools of control. Some 82 percent of the more than 2300 who spoke to the inquiry suffered sexual abuse. Male survivors reported higher levels of abuse than females, including sexual abuse.\n\nThe report estimates the overall cost to society of this abuse at between $96 billion and $217b, with the majority of this - up to $172b - borne by the survivors themselves. The average lifetime cost per survivor from loss of enjoyment of normal day-to-day activities was estimated at $875,000.\n\nThey told the inquiry they want care systems to fundamentally change, with power, funding and control handed to local communities. Faith-based institutions would exit the \"business of care\", and \"out-of-wh\u0101nau\" care would become only a short-term measure to give the wh\u0101nau time to receive support. Police would set up a dedicated team,\n\nThe report delivers 138 recommendations.\n\nA small selection of quotes from the executive summary lays out a grim litany of the horrors of the care system:\n\n\"For some it was a lifetime; for others it led to an unmarked grave ... degraded because of their ethnicity and skin colour ... ableist, disablist and audist abuse ... sexual abuse was used to punish and intimidate ... sexually assaulted, raped and forced to perform sexual acts ... locked in areas with limited or no access to toilets and water ... survivors of disability care settings were exploited in sheltered workshops for minimal or no pay, or had their money taken by staff or caregivers ... in faith-based care settings, abuse was treated as a religious transgression ...\"\n\n\"Many survivors died while they were in care or by suicide following care. For others, the impacts of abuse are ongoing and compounding, making everyday activities and choices challenging.\"\n\nIt is not just a systemic failing.\n\n\"The people who perpetrated abuse and neglect in State and faith-based care took advantage of their positions of power ... were rarely held to account for their actions or inactions, which emboldened them ... came from all walks of life and were frequently trusted and well-regarded ... institutional systems they operated in enabled abusers and institutions to abuse and neglect those in their care and act with impunity.\"\n\nBut importantly, the report finds, it is also a systemic failing.\n\n\"The State was ultimately responsible for the care system during the Inquiry period. This system was one of institutionalisation ... the State placed children, young people and adults in punitive, institutional settings that segregated and isolated them from their wh\u0101nau and communities where they were out of sight and out of mind...\n\n\"Most of the factors that led or contributed to abuse and neglect during the Inquiry period continue to persist ... It has been minimised and covered up by the institutions responsible. Significant resources have been used to deny survivors their voice and to defend the indefensible. This must stop.\"\n\nThe report calls for \"radical\" change from the government.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hipkins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hipkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_camp_(correctional)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boot camp (correctional)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasifika_New_Zealanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasifika New Zealanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oranga_Tamariki", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oranga Tamariki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Stanford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erica Stanford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karakia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devaluation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devaluation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rongo\u0101", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rongo\u0101"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Chhour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen Chhour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Aotearoa_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Labour_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Labour Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chl\u00f6e_Swarbrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whakapapa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whakapapa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Ngarewa-Packer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debbie Ngarewa-Packer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_First", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand First"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--6DkN_apE--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1721786258/4KMJEZP_MicrosoftTeams_image_png?_a=BACCd2AD", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 2349, "textEnd": 2360}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The authors said it is the widest-ranging exploration of abuse and neglect of people in care ever conducted worldwide. They decried the widespread abuse and neglect of hundreds of thousands of people in care between 1950 and 1999 as a \"national disgrace\" and made 138 recommendations.\n\nPrevious New Zealand governments had resisted holding such an inquiry.\n\nOther countries have conducted similar investigations over the past two decades. Among them:\n\n-- Australia held two recent inquiries into the abuse of children and disabled people. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse ran from 2012-2017 and scrutinized public, church and private institutions -- including child care, cultural, educational, religious, sporting and other organizations. Then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison made an emotional public apology in 2018 for the systemic sexual abuse of children in Australia. A second Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability operated from 2019-2023, examining mistreatment of disabled people in all areas of society.\n\n-- Two decades earlier, Australia investigated its systematic removal of Indigenous children from their families in the report \"Bringing Them Home,\" which followed a national inquiry from 1995-1997 into the so-called Stolen Generations of young Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders taken by the state between 1910 and 1970 -- thought to be between 10% and 30% of all such children. Then-Prime Minister John Howard rejected the report's call for a national apology, but a later Australian leader, Kevin Rudd, gave one in 2008.\n\n-- Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission extended from 2007-2015 and examined individual and collective harms perpetrated against Aboriginal people between 1883 and 1996 in government-funded, church-run residential schools, where 150,000 children were placed. Sexual abuse and religious indoctrination were rife. Pope Francis in 2022 apologized for the Catholic Church's involvement with Canada's \"catastrophic\" policy of Indigenous residential schools, one of several he has made for the church's transgressions against children in care settings around the world.\n\n-- In 2022, the United States Interior Department released a first-of-its-kind federal study of Native American boarding schools that for over a century sought to assimilate Indigenous children into white society and undercut their cultural and tribal ties. It identified more than 500 student deaths at more than 400 schools that were established or supported by the U.S. government. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary, acknowledged the boarding school era perpetuated poverty, mental health disorders, substance abuse and premature deaths in Indigenous communities.\n\n-- In England and Wales, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse ranged from 2015-2022, examining abuse and exploitation in state institutions -- including police, government departments, schools, health services and custodial institutions -- and non-state institutions, including religious organizations and private schools. It covered abuse that happened \"in living memory.\"\n\n-- The Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry covered the physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children between 1922 and 1995. It ran 2013-2017 and examined abuse in state and non-state residential institutions, including religious institutions and excluding schools.\n\n-- Ireland's Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse ranged from 2000 until 2009, and initially scrutinized physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children that happened between 1940 and 1999 -- before it was extended to reach back as far as 1914. It covered a comprehensive list of state and religious-run institutions, although it excluded the notorious Magdalene Laundries, where 10,000 so-called fallen women were consigned and forced to undertake menial labor. A government apology to the women was made in 2013. Pope Francis apologized to the tens of thousands of women and children abused in the Catholic Church's care in 2018.\n\n-- The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry began in 2015 and is ongoing. It covers abuse in living memory that happened in a wide-ranging list of state or non-state institutions, including faith-based groups.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation -- a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars -- or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.\n\nThe publication of findings by the Royal Commission -- the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand -- capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations' struggles to reckon with authorities' transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.\n\nThe results were a \"national disgrace,\" the inquiry's report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 1999 -- in a country which today has a population of just 5 million -- nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the reported said.

The authors said it is the widest-ranging exploration of abuse and neglect of people in care ever conducted worldwide. They decried the widespread abuse and neglect of hundreds of thousands of people in care between 1950 and 1999 as a \"national disgrace\" and made 138 recommendations.\n\nPrevious New Zealand governments had resisted holding such an inquiry.\n\nOther countries have conducted similar investigations over the past two decades. Among them:\n\n-- Australia held two recent inquiries into the abuse of children and disabled people. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse ran from 2012-2017 and scrutinized public, church and private institutions -- including child care, cultural, educational, religious, sporting and other organizations. Then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison made an emotional public apology in 2018 for the systemic sexual abuse of children in Australia. A second Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability operated from 2019-2023, examining mistreatment of disabled people in all areas of society.\n\n-- Two decades earlier, Australia investigated its systematic removal of Indigenous children from their families in the report \"Bringing Them Home,\" which followed a national inquiry from 1995-1997 into the so-called Stolen Generations of young Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders taken by the state between 1910 and 1970 -- thought to be between 10% and 30% of all such children. Then-Prime Minister John Howard rejected the report's call for a national apology, but a later Australian leader, Kevin Rudd, gave one in 2008.\n\n-- Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission extended from 2007-2015 and examined individual and collective harms perpetrated against Aboriginal people between 1883 and 1996 in government-funded, church-run residential schools, where 150,000 children were placed. Sexual abuse and religious indoctrination were rife. Pope Francis in 2022 apologized for the Catholic Church's involvement with Canada's \"catastrophic\" policy of Indigenous residential schools, one of several he has made for the church's transgressions against children in care settings around the world.\n\n-- In 2022, the United States Interior Department released a first-of-its-kind federal study of Native American boarding schools that for over a century sought to assimilate Indigenous children into white society and undercut their cultural and tribal ties. It identified more than 500 student deaths at more than 400 schools that were established or supported by the U.S. government. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary, acknowledged the boarding school era perpetuated poverty, mental health disorders, substance abuse and premature deaths in Indigenous communities.\n\n-- In England and Wales, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse ranged from 2015-2022, examining abuse and exploitation in state institutions -- including police, government departments, schools, health services and custodial institutions -- and non-state institutions, including religious organizations and private schools. It covered abuse that happened \"in living memory.\"\n\n-- The Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry covered the physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children between 1922 and 1995. It ran 2013-2017 and examined abuse in state and non-state residential institutions, including religious institutions and excluding schools.\n\n-- Ireland's Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse ranged from 2000 until 2009, and initially scrutinized physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect of children that happened between 1940 and 1999 -- before it was extended to reach back as far as 1914. It covered a comprehensive list of state and religious-run institutions, although it excluded the notorious Magdalene Laundries, where 10,000 so-called fallen women were consigned and forced to undertake menial labor. A government apology to the women was made in 2013. Pope Francis apologized to the tens of thousands of women and children abused in the Catholic Church's care in 2018.\n\n-- The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry began in 2015 and is ongoing. It covers abuse in living memory that happened in a wide-ranging list of state or non-state institutions, including faith-based groups.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Officials called the report's findings a \"national disgrace,\" involving the abuse of children, young adults and the elderly.\n\nThe report estimated that about 200,000 of the 655,000 children, young people and adults in state and faith-based care were abused over the time of the report and even more were neglected. The commission said the true number will never be known because of lost and destroyed records and incidents where no records were created.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family, \" said the report, which has 16 volumes over 2,944 pages.\n\nSome on the commission called for a \"total system overall.\" Judge Coral Shaw, who chaired the investigation, said the abuses described in the report must never happen again.\n\n\"The people who were taken into care were babies, they were young children, they were young people and they were adults who needed care,\" Shaw said, according to The Guardian. \"They were taken under the guise of being supported and protected but instead they were abused and harmed.\"\n\nA formal national apology was part of some 95 redress recommendations and another 138 additional changes.

He was tortured at the old Lake Alice hospital. He was given electric shock treatment for doing things like wetting the bed as a 14-year-old.\n\n\"But, despite so many setbacks, Paul has never given up in his quest for justice and accountability. He supports other survivors and he's just a real Kiwi battler.\"\n\nAlong with the harrowing stories of abuse came a torrent of apologies, something Morrah thinks falls on deaf ears.\n\n\"I clearly remember Cardinal John Dew stepping up and apologising and acknowledging that Catholic Church systems and its culture allowed children to be abused and that was a hugely significant day.\n\n\"But, some of these survivors have been raising these concerns for decades and have not felt listened to. So the apologies, I think, ring hollow.\"\n\nAn independent redress scheme is expected as part of the Crown's response. An interim report on redress made 95 recommendations calling for urgent action.\n\nThe report said many survivors attempting to obtain redress were rejected \"time and time again\" with their experiences often \"downplayed, disbelieved or dismissed\".\n\nMorrah said several people he has spoken to who have entered the redress process say it is incredibly drawn out.\n\n\"I spoke with a leading lawyer in this area, Sonja Cooper, who has thousands of clients from state abuse and she said the average time it takes to have some form of compensation or payout is about six years,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon is expected to deliver a formal apology to those who experienced abuse in state and faith-based care on November 12 at Parliament.\n\nLuxon said what he had read of the report so far was \"horrific and harrowing\". The report was 3000 pages long and weighed 14kg.\n\n\"This is a shameful part of our history,\" he said.\n\nMorrah said survivors would hope some kind of action is taken well before November.\n\n\"This is an incredibly dark chapter in New Zealand where survivors were silenced. Some claimed cover-ups of complaints.\n\n\"This has impacted the most marginalised groups in society. We had church leaders who befriended families to get access to and sexually abuse children.

I am sorry that it has taken so long for this acknowledgement of torture,\" Luxon said to Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nNow, as the Government gears up to deliver a formal apology in November, it could also be staring down the barrel of paying out redress to the tune of $217 billion, according to estimations in the commission's report.\n\nThen there's the potential for a swathe of civil proceedings and further damages to be awarded through the courts, with cases expected to be taken against individuals, including former ministers and senior public servants.\n\nThe commission clearly lays fault at the feet of the state, singling out successive ministers and heads of what is now Oranga Tamariki (formerly the Child Welfare Division), ministers and heads of education, ministers and heads of social development, ministers and directors general of health and mental health, police commissioners and public service commissioners.\n\nMeanwhile, the commission found the state and faith-based institutions have covered up the systemic abuse and neglect across decades and successive governments.\n\nThese specific findings of fault open up a pathway for survivors to bring legal cases against former and current senior politicians and public servants, as well as government departments.\n\nAnd among the inquiry's 138 recommendations are calls to prioritise civil proceedings through the courts, and remove barriers to these cases being heard, including statutes of limitations and former settlements.\n\nThe commission, which was set up under Jacindas Ardern's coalition government in 2018 and launched in 2019, has taken five years to report back and cost $150 million.\n\nThe commission heard from 2300 survivors, who shared harrowing and explicit testimonies of sexual abuse by adults in positions of power, peers and groups of people including examples of trafficking and organised abuse; extreme physical abuse including beatings and electric shocks; psychological abuse; neglect such as being tied up for days, and being left without food and bedding, and no emotional support.\n\nMs MC - a M\u0101ori woman who was first put into foster care when she was a toddler - told the commission about a lifetime of sexual and physical abuse, and neglect.\n\n\"I was only about 12 or 13 years old. I gave birth on their bed, on a big plastic sheet so I wouldn't make a mess. After it arrived, they took it away ... I think I've been pregnant 12 to 15 times. Once a baby came out, another one came in. It felt like there were no breaks in between,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't know what happened to the babies. I think they either kept them or gave them away ... I know some of the babies weren't born 'normal'. Those ones, I'd hate to think what they did to them, knowing what they did to me.\"\n\nThe commission found when people acted out (ran away, broke rules, stole, drank alcohol) in response to the abuse and neglect they faced, they were met with more abuse and neglect. This often led to people being moved between institutions, and some of those who had been abused went on to abuse others.\n\nThe commission concluded that in many cases, state care became a pathway into gangs and into prison.\n\nSurvivor and academic Dr Rawiri Waretini-Karena told the commission: \"I was 18 when I walked into the yard - never been to prison before. I walked out into the yard and there were 50 men there. I knew 45 of them, that's because they were beside me in the social welfare homes, the family homes and the boys' homes. So that's when I realised there was a pipeline to prison process.\"\n\nWiremu Waikari (Ng\u0101ti Porou) told the commission he had minimal education while at Kohitere Boys' Training Centre, but was exposed to and learnt about criminal conduct and activities from other residents on a daily basis.\n\n\"It was the links I made in Hokio and Kohitere that led me to joining the Mongrel Mob when I was 16 years old. I loved it because I already knew them - I felt more at home with Mob members than I did with my own family.\"\n\nWaikari said the boys' homes fed gangs \"disenfranchised young people who were not nurtured by M\u0101ori or the state\" throughout the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\"That is definitely where my time in state care pushed me, and hundreds of other unhappy M\u0101ori kids, who weren't sure of themselves in any world.\"\n\nWaikari left the Mob while in prison and became a social worker, and now works in education and coaching people who are facing trauma.\n\nOn Wednesday, Luxon stood by his Government's gang policies.\n\n\"We are determined that gangs cannot peddle harm and suffering on their fellow citizens. We will continue to work with them to make sure they have an opportunity to turn their lives around.\"\n\nThe report has been made public in the same week the Government launched its young offender boot camp pilot.\n\nOne of the case studies in the report focused on the harm done by boot camps and military-style punishments, with specific focus on the boot camp on Aotea Great Barrier Island, Whakapakiri. The chapter is called: \"A case study of state\u2010funded violence and abuse of children and young people needing care and protection.\"\n\nWhile Children's Minister Karen Chhour said the new military-style youth academy was \"nothing like a boot camp\", the rebranding has only happened in recent months as opposition from experts and the public has mounted.\n\nThose who were exposed to the abuse detailed in the report - and their wh\u0101nau - have suffered lifelong harm. In some cases, this included physical medical issues, mental health issues and suicidal ideation, shame and humiliation, issues with trust and intimacy, and a disconnection from culture and language.\n\n\"I witnessed other boys at Kohitere harming themselves. There wasn't anywhere for them to get help,\" Waikari said.\n\n\"Suicide became something that was normalised for me - it happened so often that I just began to accept it when people would disappear.\"\n\nThe commission's report covered the extent and the nature of the abuse and neglect, as well as the factors that led to people being placed in care.\n\nA common question from survivors is: What did I do to deserve this?\n\nThe commission found racism, ableism and disablism, societal attitudes towards deaf and disabled people, moral panic regarding so-called delinquency and mental health, and major societal shifts such as welfare reform, urbanisation and rising poverty rates were all key factors in going into care - either through compulsion by the state or voluntarily.\n\nOn Wednesday, Luxon and Erica Stanford - the minister leading the Government response - unreservedly apologised for the harm done to survivors, and said they now planned to attempt to do right by them through redress and carefully considering the commission's recommendations.\n\nLuxon thanked survivors for their bravery and honesty.\n\n\"I cannot take away your pain but I can tell you this: Today you are heard and you are believed. The state was supposed to care for you, to protect you, but instead it subjected you to unimaginable physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse.\n\n\"A number of faith-based schools, institutions and people in positions of authority, who you should have been able to trust, failed you in the worst possible way. This is a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history. And as a society and as a state we should have done better and I am determined that we will do.\"\n\nStanford said survivors' stories were now etched in the pages of history and officially corrected the record.\n\n\"The stories contained in this report serve as a jolt of reality. The kinds of unimaginable, despicable horrors and abuse and neglect and fear that we always believed happened in other countries, happen here. They happened at scale, and they destroyed lives.\"\n\nStanford said she had read all of the stories. When talking about the experiences of unwed mothers whose babies were taken from them when they were drugged, she became emotional. \"That is confronting,\" Stanford said.\n\nAhead of the public release of the final report, the commission delivered five interim reports, including specific findings on the torture that happened at the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit, which the Government has now accepted.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Luxon told the House: \"It is my heavy duty to say that today, the Government is formally acknowledging that the experiences of some children and young people at Lake Alice Hospital did amount to torture.\"\n\nPatients at Lake Alice were given electric shocks without anaesthetic, as well as painful and immobilising paraldehyde injections.\n\nThese so-called treatments were not administered for medical reasons. They were used for punishment and emotional control.\n\n\"These experiences were nothing short of horrific and they happened in the New Zealand health system within living memory,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\n\"To the survivors of Lake Alice - some of whom are here today - thank you for your determination to ensure what you suffered was brought to light.\n\n\"What happened was wrong. You knew then it was wrong, and all these years later, the state also acknowledges it was wrong.\n\n\"Today, I humbly stand before you in this house to offer a long overdue apology to the survivors of Lake Alice. I am sorry that it has taken so long for this acknowledgement of torture.\"\n\nIn 2021, the commission released a report into how to design a redress system that acknowledged what survivors and their wh\u0101nau had experienced, and offered fair compensation.\n\nThe report looks at the current, piecemeal, and inconsistent redress schemes in play.\n\nThe commission's first recommendation is to implement all 59 recommendations of the 2021 redress report.\n\nIn response, a Cabinet paper showed Stanford had established a ministerial group to work with the redress design group that was led by survivors.\n\nStanford said she would be prioritising redress in terms of the Government's response, especially for Lake Alice survivors and victims, many of whom were elderly and unwell.\n\n\"We know that time is of the essence.\"\n\nThe commission's final report said that based on the estimated number of people abused and neglected in care between 1950 and 2019, the total cost was between $96b and $217 billion.\n\nThe average lifetime cost to the survivor of things that New Zealanders considered normal, day-to-day activities was estimated in 2020 to be approximately $857,000 per person.\n\nLuxon would not comment on the potential total cost of redress, saying the monetary value wasn't a factor in his thinking.\n\n\"When you read those accounts, and you read these reports, it's important we do the right thing.\"\n\nBetween 1950 and 2019, 655,000 children, young people and adults were placed into the care of the state. The peak was in the 1970s with about 56,000 children being put into the state system. Of this group, an estimated 200,000 were abused and even more were neglected.\n\nThe inquiry said the true number would never be fully known as records of the most vulnerable people were never created or were lost and, in some cases, destroyed.\n\nWhile other countries, including Australia and Canada, have held similar inquiries, New Zealand's numbers put them to shame. During a 100-year period, 150,000 kids went through indigenous residential schools in Canada. While it's estimated that 50,000 children were separated from their families in Australia between 1800 and 2000.\n\nThe inquiry said it was \"a national disgrace\" that hundreds of thousands of children, young people and adults were abused and neglected in the care of the state and faith-based institutions.\n\n\"These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,\" it said.\n\n\"If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever.\"\n\nOf those placed in care, as many as 80 percent were M\u0101ori, across the inquiry period. In the 2022/2023 financial year, that number remained high at 69 percent. Pacific people were also over-represented.\n\nWhile the inquiry focused on historical harm, abuse and neglect in state care settings continues. In the 2022-2023 year, Oranga Tamariki reported that 519 children were harmed while in care, and some more than once, with 895 total incidents reported.\n\nIt's clear some of the issues that led to abuse and neglect continue.\n\nThe inquiry technically covered the period from 1950 to 1999, but it had the ability to look outside of that timeframe to better understand the systems still in play today. Among the recommendations are calls to overhaul the oversight of the current care system, improve education and vetting, and close care and protection residences that continue to perpetuate the institutional environments and practices that led to historic abuse and neglect in care.\n\nThe report - which has been more than five years in the making and spans 16 volumes, covering almost 3000 pages - said survivors were right to call for an inquiry.\n\n\"There has been widespread abuse and neglect in state and faith-based care which has had a devastating personal and multigenerational impact on survivors, their wh\u0101nau and society as a whole.\n\n\"It has been minimised and covered up by the institutions responsible. Significant resources have been used to deny survivors their voice and to defend the indefensible. This must stop.\"\n\nThe report not only found widespread, systemic abuse and neglect at state and faith-based institutions - including boarding schools, borstals, boot camps, psychiatric institutions, and foster homes - it also found the state had attempted to cover up the abuse for the subsequent decades.\n\n\"Political and public service leaders spent time, energy and taxpayer resources to hide, cover up and then legally fight survivors to protect the potential perceived costs to the Crown, and their own reputations.\"\n\nFaith leaders similarly fought to cover up abuse by moving abusers to other locations and denying culpability.\n\nThe report said despite decades of calls for investigations, inquiries and redress, survivors had been \"unheard, disbelieved, ignored and silenced\".\n\nTheir experiences had been minimised or dismissed, and they were told by those in power that the abuse and neglect was not systemic.\n\nAny recognition to date had been \"piecemeal\" and \"insincere\", took years to to extract from the state and faith-based institutions and \"fell far short of any notions of fair redress\".\n\nThe Government apology - led by the Prime Minister - will be delivered in November. This is the second recommendation of the commission's report, following calls to adopt the new redress scheme.\n\nHow and where that apology is delivered is being developed in collaboration with survivors.\n\nFollowing on from an apology from the Prime Minister, the commission recommends all faith-based leaders offer a public apology, including the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the President Elect of the Methodist Church, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in New Zealand and the head of each individual Presbyterian Support Organisation, the General of the Salvation Army, the Overseeing Shepherd of Gloriavale, and the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nThe commission has also called for public apologies from public sector leaders, including the Public Service Commissioner, Solicitor\u2010General, Commissioner of NZ Police and the chief executives of Oranga Tamariki, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Education.\n\n\"Survivors are united in calling for state and faith leaders to make public apologies and take accountability for the harm caused to children, young people and adults,\" the commission said.\n\n\"This includes the Prime Minister and faith leaders, but it goes much deeper. All public sector leaders, leaders of relevant professional bodies, leaders of care providers and leaders of faith-based institutions need to apologise to survivors publicly.\"\n\nAmong the recommendations was a call for a standalone and independent Care Safe Agency, to oversee the care sector, set professional standards, accreditation, vetting and administer a new Care Safety Act.\n\nThe new agency should be required to report publicly to Parliament, and face scrutiny from a select committee, every year. And a full review of the agency, regulations, and relevant legislation should be reviewed after nine years.\n\nStanford said some of the more complex recommendations would take more time to consider and respond to, particularly those involving legislative and major organisational change.\n\nStanford said the Government would provide an update on progress in November, but expected the work would continue in 2025.\n\nThe commission also recommended the establishment of a separate police investigation unit to pursue historical and current cases of abuse.\n\nAmong the recommendations were calls for faith-based institutions to bring in better vetting, background checks and oversight.\n\nOne of the top recommendations was for the Catholic Church in New Zealand to write to the Pope and other church leaders to express concern about accused and convicted abusers having been sent to Papua New Guinea, where little is known about their whereabouts or the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there.\n\nOne of the 16 volumes is a case study on abuse and neglect perpetrated by Jehovah's Witnesses in New Zealand. The case study showed there were risk factors in how the church operated, including a lack of oversight, survivors being forced to give evidence without parents present, and a fear of being shunned by the community or excommunicated.\n\nThe church denied responsibility throughout the inquiry, saying these children were never technically in their care.\n\nAnd this week, the Jehovah's Witnesses failed in an eleventh hour legal attempt to block this part of the report.\n\nThe commission set up a separate inquiry into allegations of child sexual abuse by a \"paedophile ring\" of former central government politicians in the 1980s.\n\nThe commission began a confidential investigation into the allegations because of a concern that survivors and witnesses may not come forward to the Inquiry out of fear of retribution, or that there would be a \"cover up\" if alleged abusers became aware of the investigation.\n\nThe scope of the investigation later broadened to include all allegations of organised abuse of children and young people in state care by people in public positions of power and influence.\n\nThis included situations where children in care were taken out of facilities, and Catholic clergy were able to choose which boys to abuse. This was investigated by the Catholic Church but it was unclear what happened as a result.\n\nIn regards to the alleged paedophile ring, the commission did not gather enough evidence to substantiate the claims.\n\nThe inquiry did receive direct information from two survivors who alleged they had been sexually abused by different individual former central government politicians.\n\nOne of the allegations was referred to police in June 2023. In November, police said progress has been hindered by challenges in locating evidence.\n\n\"While the evidence that the Inquiry received is deeply suspicious, the Inquiry is unable to make a finding that organised abuse of children and young people in State care occurred by groups of people in public positions of influence.\"\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon told parliament the tabling of the report was of historical significance.\n\n\"It is the result of the largest and most complex public inquiry ever held on our shores. Because of this, the content needs to be considered with respect and with care.\n\n\"It cannot be rushed. The findings in this report need to be widely understood.\"\n\nHe said the Government must be accountable for what happened.\n\n\"It is important that, as a country, we bring to the surface and understand the hard truths of what happened so we can try and move forward together.\n\n\"I say to the survivors, the burden is no longer yours to carry alone. The state is now standing here beside you, accountable and ready to take action.\"\n\nLabour leader Chris Hipkins said he was committed to working on a bipartisan solution for redress.\n\n\"The abuse in care has happened over generations, it's happened over successive governments of all different persuasions. It's vitally important that parliament comes together, that we rise above politics, that we focus on properly addressing the underlying causes of abuse in state care and that we put things right.\n\n\"It's going to take some time, it's going to be hard work and next steps of this process are going to span over multiple government's as well. This must not be about politics in any way, this must be about doing the right thing.\n\nTe P\u0101ti M\u0101ori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said the apology could not be taken seriously while the Government made plans to introduce legislation to \"tackle gangs\" and reinstate military youth academies.\n\nThe links of state care and abuse to gangs, and the impact of \"boot camps\" was a recurring theme from survivors.\n\n\"We've got a Government who didn't read all the [previous] reports ... so do we think the apology will be authentic? Will the apology and the adopting recommendations give absolute assurance to us as a nation that there will be no repeat of it? That is where we have really grave concerns.\"\n\nCo-leader Rawiri Waititi said the current policy agenda was \"history repeating itself\".\n\n\"The apology is one thing, but stopping harmful legislation would be the biggest thing this Government can do, but at this particular time they're making it worse.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsroom.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsroom"},

What I can commit to you is we will engage with the Royal Commission's report and recommendations in good faith, with careful consideration and we will never lose sight of what you have endured to bring the truth to light,\" Mr Luxon says.\n\nNote to editors: The report can be found on the Royal Commission's website here: www.abuseincare.org.nz.\n\n/Public Release.

Thousands of abuse survivors shared their stories across 133 days of public hearings, including our clients.\"\n\n\"Shockingly, more than 1.1Million documents were received with complaints and recommendations to address institutional wrongdoing.\"\n\n\"Survivors today will have many questions out of today's findings. We're encouraged by the recommendation to introduce a holistic redress scheme.\n\n\"It also recommended that the Crown offer faith-based institutions and indirect State care providers a window of opportunity to voluntarily join the scheme. We now wait for institutions and churches to acknowledge the harm caused to survivors.\"\n\n\"The most significant of the recommendations is the Inquiry's recommendation that apologies should acknowledge harm and should include a commitment to financially support the restoration of wellbeing and mana for survivors.\"\n\n\"It is also a significant step forward to allow for claims to be reopened to allow for fair compensation where the Crown deems a settlement inadequate for the harm caused.\".\n\n\"The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional abuse learned that it can take more than 20 years for a survivor to muster the courage to confront the wrongdoing they were subjected to. The NZ Royal Commission has fallen short in its understanding of a survivor's journey by not acknowledging the need to lift limitation laws. It places the power back in the hands of the Crown and limits the scope for compensation for historic abuse. This is not holistic, it's a cop out.\"\n\nShine Lawyers' client, Jack*, was abused at school when he was 11 years old by a Catholic Priest. In 2022, Jack read about Shine Lawyers' work in abuse law in the media, when another client went public about the abuse at the School. The School Board accepted Jack's claim but said that without the Royal Commission's redress due to be announced was not in a position to meet our client's claim.\n\nJack's relationships and employment history were affected. He was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression and relies on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety mediation to manage his symptoms. He takes sleeping tablets and receives psychiatric treatment when required.\n\nIt became obvious in the course of Shine's investigations that the abuse dated as far back as the 1950s, decades prior to Jack's abuse. There was a pattern of abuse, and it is highly probable that several other complainants are yet to come forward. It is also highly probable that had the priest been reprimanded for his conduct earlier, Jack's abuse may not have occurred.\n\nCurrently in New Zealand there is a six-year limitation date for a claimant to bring a claim against a defendant from the date the cause of action or omission arose (the limitation period is a defence and there are exceptions as to when the limitation period rises). As the Royal Commission Inquiry in Australia found, it was nonsensical to have such a date apply to historic abuse survivors as on average it takes an historic abuse survivor 25 years to recall the abuse due to a psychological term called repressed memory, the mind's way of suppressing the abuse. The Royal Commission in Australia abolished the archaic limitation laws that apply to historic abuse, which has meant that thousands of history abuse survivors have been able to access compensation and closure.\n\nShine Lawyers made submissions in 2019 for the scope of the New Zealand enquiry to be widened from considering only abuse in state care, to faith-based institutions as well. The scope of the Inquiry was later widened.\n\nIn New Zealand, there is the added complexity of ACC, which prevents claims for personal injury. In contrast, a recent landmark case in Australia awarded the sum of $5.5million to the claimant.\n\nThe Royal Commission Inquiry in December 2021 released its findings that on average the economic cost of abuse is around $900,000. However, the average offers of settlement for historic abuse claims in New Zealand is around $20,000.\n\n\"We are hopeful that we see some positive change, not just around the long-awaited redress scheme, puretumu torowh\u0101nui, but positive change to legislation to allow claimants access to compensation that isn't described as a slap in the face or are instead vigorously defended. \"", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_Lawyers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shine Lawyers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hearing (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiolytic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antidepressant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypnotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_(Take_That_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shine (Take That song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

It has been obvious for years that the bill for adequate compensation could run into billions. Regardless, billions have been poured into other areas, such as reinstating a huge tax break for landlords. When the government dismisses something as unaffordable, this is usually a reflection of its own political preferences, in the wake of choices it has already made.\n\nThis week, the government appeared unprepared to provide even a timeline for when the compensation funds will be paid out, on what terms, and whether back-dating is on the cards. In addition, the cost of the structural changes that the Royal Commission has urged the government to embrace is also unknown.\n\nTo keep faith with the victims, the compensation payments - and funding for the systemic changes required in the Police, ACC, psychiatric care and disability facilities etc - will have to be treated as a political urgency. It will be costly, but the victims have already paid a terrible price in human terms. As the Royal Commission has also pointed out, the victims have also borne the lion's share of the economic costs of their abuse:\n\nBased on the estimated number of people abused and neglected in care between 1950 and 2019, the total cost is estimated to be between $96 billion and $217 billion. Of this the smallest proportion, up to $46.7 billion, is paid by the taxpayers of New Zealand. The largest cost, estimated at up to $172 billion, is borne by survivors.\n\nThat injustice has to be promptly addressed. Otherwise, as one skeptical survivor said last week, do the politicians even know what they're apologising for?\n\nIn Australia, a Royal Commission of Inquiry into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse was set up over a decade ago by Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It began work in 2013 and concluded in 2017 with the publication of a multi-volume series of findings and recommendations. A few months after that, Labour PM Jacinda Ardern launched our own Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in State Care.\n\nAmong a myriad of recommendations, the Australian inquiry strongly recommended that the Catholic Church should cease some of its practices that were held to be directly responsible for creating a toxic climate conducive to abuse, such as priestly celibacy. The Church should also be willing, it was argued, to automatically waive confessional box secrecy whenever child abuse has been confessed.\n\nHere, our Royal Commission has recognised that \"Religious beliefs were often used to justify the abuse and neglect, and to silence survivors.\" While its recommendations in this area do not go as far as its Australian counterpart, the Royal Commission does extensively discuss the celibacy issue, and the \"clericalism\" that both encourages abuse and conceals its disclosure. ( See Chapter 8, para 656 and following.) For example, the Royal Commission says:\n\nResearch suggests that the requirement to agree to celibacy for Catholic priests, nuns, sisters and brothers may deprive them of romantic and physical intimacy, which when combined with unchecked power over children in care can lead to abuse.. Internationally, some men have admitted they entered the priesthood to curb pre-existing sexual problems, such as child sex offending, in the 'sex-free' zone of clerical life... Dr Thomas Doyle, former priest, canon lawyer, and addictions therapist, told the Inquiry that \"mandatory celibacy has had a definite influence on the development of dysfunctional sexuality within the context of the closed clerical world.\"\n\nMoreover, as the Commission also indicates, Catholic authorities have routinely treated sexual abuse by its clerics not as a crime but as a sin - thereby opening the door to declarations of repentance by the perpetrators, who would commonly be shifted to other locations, free to lapse again. Moreover, once abuse had been classified as a sin qualifying for forgiveness, the report notes that some victims would be coerced into pardoning their abusers, under pain of sin if they refused.\n\nAs the Commission's report makes clear, these double binds were prevalent within the Catholic Church, but were not uncommon in the caring institutions managed by other religious denominations. Throughout, the state failed to carry out its oversight duty of care to protect the victims, and often did not treat their complaints of abuse seriously.\n\nThe state failed in its oversight role not only within faith-based caring institutions. In state-run youth detention centres, disability work-shops, special schools and psychiatric care facilities, physical and sexual abuse was also rife - and not only carried out by staff and clinicians, but routinely condoned and encouraged between the inmates themselves. At Lake Alice psychiatric facility, electroshock treatments akin to torture were carried out experimentally, and were also used (and threatened) as punishments to enforce compliance.\n\n...Abusers groomed children, young people and adults in care into trusting them. They also groomed other staff, volunteers and people in leadership positions into believing they were trustworthy, which meant that survivors who tried to disclose the abuse were not believed. Many survivors were sexually assaulted, raped and forced to perform sexual acts. Sexual abuse was used to punish and intimidate. In some cases, abusers organised the sexual abuse of survivors by trafficking them to members of the public.\n\nMedical abuse and neglect occurred in many care settings. This included improper medical treatment and practices, misuse of medication or medical equipment and treatment without consent, including electric shocks. Chemical restraint, like sedation, was used to control behaviour and as a form of punishment in disability and mental health institutions and social welfare residences.\n\nWomen and girls were routinely tested for sexually transmitted infections and were often forced to have degrading internal vaginal examinations. Clinicians would sometimes use medical checks as an opportunity for sexual abuse.\n\nSolitary confinement was commonly used to manage or control behaviour and as a form of punishment. In disability and mental health institutions, special schools and social welfare residences, some survivors were locked in areas with limited or no access to toilets and water....\n\nHow could this happen? Routinely, authority appears to breed contempt for those induced to submit to it. Once vulnerable people are deemed to be either mad or bad, the Royal Commission findings show how there can be no limits to how some individuals and organisations will mis-use the secular and spiritual powers vested in them.\n\nIn fact, reading the Royal Commission report brings home the extent to which power in these \"caring\" institutions was hierarchically organised, with no effective checks and balances on those at the top. Perhaps for that reason, many of the Royal Commission's 138 recommendations are as much about trying to future-proof the systems of care against further abuse, as they are about redressing past wrongs, or setting up compensation procedures for the people still bearing the scars. Since those corrosive impacts can be intergenerational, the Royal Commission has acknowledged that compensation may need to go beyond the initial victims in the cycles of abuse, and include wider whanau.\n\nGiven the advancing age of many of the estimated 200,000 victims, the need for urgency is obvious. While money isn't everything, compensation will be one tangible test of the government's sincerity about addressing the state's past failings.\n\nTalking about future proofing... in Parliament last week, some MPs alleged that the dangerous power imbalance in some modern institutions - such as military style boot camps - carries a similar potential for systemic abuse. Arrun Soma, one of the Royal Commissioners made a relevant point in this official summary of the report findings:\n\nMany residences and institutions developed cultures and practices that were often reflective of society's attitudes to be punitive or to segregate those perceived as 'other'. These de-humanised people in care, and tolerated or encouraged abuse and neglect. People with military backgrounds were assumed to be appropriate to care for children, young people and adults in care, and many brought with them a culture of command and control, punishment, physical violence and verbal abuse. (My emphasis.)\n\nEvidently, history is on the brink of repeating itself. As for faith-based organisations, the Royal Commission offered several ways in which religious leaders should be publicly accountable for the behaviour (and training) of the religious personnel to whom they assign spiritual powers over their flocks.\n\nTo that end, each leader of the eight denominations within the Commission's terms of reference was urged to personally apologise to their victims, and to indicate a willingness to impose lifelong sanctions on any religious personnel found likely \"on the balance of probabilities\" to have abused their authority. Only by doing so, the Royal Commission indicated, can the cycle of treating physical and sexual abuse as a sin and not as a crime, be broken.\n\nThe report carries extensive discussion (again, see chapter 8) of the beliefs and practices at Gloriavale community that continue to be conducive to physical and sexual abuse, starting with the genderised division of roles, and the belief-based concentration of all effective authority solely in the hands of men. According to the Royal Commission, the state must ensure the \"ongoing safety\"of the inhabitants of the Gloriavale community but - unfortunately - the recommendations do not spell out what actions and interventions this would require.\n\nFinally on the quest for a response \"bigger than politics\"... there are other grounds for petty political disputes over the Royal Commission's findings. Parliament is about to debate the ACT Party's Treaty Principles Bill that aims to remove any reference to \"Treaty principles\" from New Zealand legislation.\n\nThis puts the Bill on a direct collision course with the Royal Commission's recommendation 14, which urges the government to ensure that its response to historical abuse in care is \"designed and operated in a manner that gives effect to te Tiriti o Waitangi and its principles.\" Such concerns seem to be anathema to at least two of the three political parties that comprise the current government.\n\nClearly, the Royal Commission's excellent report is only a road map for what, in many respects, is still a work in progress.", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [],

The response cannot be rushed. It needs to be considered with respect and care,\" said Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.\n\nThe published Royal Commission report contains 138 recommendations to transform New Zealand's care system, address past injustices, and compensate survivors, including the country's children, young people and adults.\n\nThe Royal Commission of Inquiry, which was established in 2018, recommends that the government focus on supporting people to remain in their families and communities, and out-of-home care should be short-term and delivered by the community.\n\nThe first step is a formal apology which will take place this year on Nov. 12 when a significant event will be delivered, Luxon said.\n\nProf. Elizabeth Stanley of the School of Social and Cultural Studies at the Victoria University of Wellington said the report sets out, in detail, some of the most serious crimes ever committed in New Zealand. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wellington Region"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington Region"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Auckland", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Auckland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_University_of_Wellington", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria University of Wellington"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health/Home_Care", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health/Home Care", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Caregiver_Support", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Caregiver Support", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 19}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 1192, "textEnd": 1199}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Then change.\n\nSurvivors of abuse in care say it needs to be fast and far-reaching, after the final report of the six-year Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care was published on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nIt recommended a total overhaul of the care system, and a better way of providing redress for survivors.\n\nAt nearly 3000 pages, and weighing 14 kilograms when printed out, the report is damning, finding widespread abuse and neglect have permeated state and religious care for decades.\n\nIt contains survivor stories that are truly horrific.\n\nChildren at Whakapakari Camp were set to digging trenches. Combined with the violence, the rape, the waved guns, the intimidation from those in charge, many of them truly believed they were digging their own graves.\n\nDisabled children at Kimberly were raped and abused. Racism was overt across the board.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon admitted what happened at the Palmerston North boys' home Lake Alice amounted to torture.\n\nOn Wednesday, survivors packed the public gallery at Parliament, spilling out into the banquet hall, as politicians apologised and promised change.\n\nLabour leader Chris Hipkins said he wanted every New Zealander to read it; Minister for Children Karen Chourr was in tears, hands shaking as she spoke -- and she wasn't the only MP crying; M\u0101ori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer demanded: \"What's changed?\"\n\nEveryone who spoke acknowledged the collective fault of successive governments in allowing this abuse to go ahead, and ignore and bury stories from survivors.\n\nIndeed, the report found: \"Political and public service leaders spent time, energy and taxpayer resources to hide, cover up and then legally fight survivors to protect the potential perceived costs to the Crown, and their own reputations.\"\n\nLuxon announced a formal apology would be issued at Parliament on 12 November, and the minister responsible for the government's response, Erica Stanford, would establish a working group to review the recommendations.\n\nBut Green Party co-leader Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick said the apology should be taken to the people.\n\n\"Many survivors told us that they believe that this apology should have happened on their terms and in their turf, not in this institution which has caused so much harm. I hope that is the Government's next step, to come to survivors, not to continue to ask survivors to come to us.\"\n\nSurvivor and community worker Denise Messiter agreed, saying that while the experience at Parliament would be the start of a journey for many, \"the healing happens at home\".\n\n\"But I do think the perpetrator needs to own the damage, and the harm, and I do believe that the right place for it to land is here,\" she said.\n\n\"This is the place that owns all of the mamae, all of the trauma.\"\n\nThe report's recommendations included:\n\nThe report said: \"Many of the factors that contributed to abuse and neglect during the Inquiry period are not confined to the past. They are present today and continue to put people at risk of harm.\"\n\nIt said it saw no room for Oranga Tamariki in the future of the care system.\n\nFrances Tagaloa, co-chair of the survivor experiences board, said an overhaul was long overdue.\n\n\"It's been very hopeful, listening to all the politicians across the various parties supporting the recommendations, supporting the final report, acknowledging survivors... but we need to see action, now.\"\n\nShe said naturally, there would be mistrust in the government. \"Survivors have been abused by the state, and now the state is going to make decisions about what's the best way to move forward,\" she said. \"That's why we had all our hopes in this final report... it's like a taonga.\"\n\nShe said the government had had all the information it needed for years, and action had been disappointingly slow.\n\n\"Us as survivors came forward with a lot of difficulty shared our stories, because we need to see prevention. We don't want this to happen to anyone else.\"\n\nMore important than apologies was a system to compensate survivors.\n\n\"All the parties need to unite together and do this, instead of trying to score points with each other and votes,\" said survivor and artist Catherine Daniels.\n\n\"It's not about points, and it's not about votes. You're talking about people's lives.\"\n\nPaora Moyle said they carried with them people who had died before they could see this day.\n\n\"[The government's] got a road map now that is so friggen detailed,\" they said. \"And I think that survivors being here today will hold them to account.\"\n\nHohepa Taiaroa said it was good to see the politicians who spoke were in agreement about the need for change.\n\n\"For me, this is the day of tears. More of enjoyment than sadness - enjoyment that we can hand this over to the government now.

It would require \"massive amounts of bipartisanship\" and it was important to ensure all political leaders play a role.\n\n\"You have to make sure that our most vulnerable kids in state care are incredibly well looked after and cared for.\"\n\nHe also confirmed the government was at last acknowledging the Lake Alice experiences amounted to torture, and apologised for the delay in doing so.\n\nLuxon said the response to the report needed to be approached with \"respect and with care, it cannot be rushed\", pointing ahead to the formal apology set down for 12 November. He did not give a date for when redress would become available, saying the government was working on that.\n\n\"Finally, to survivors, thank you: we will never lose sight of what you have endured to bring the truth to light.\"\n\nStanford said she had read the full report and spoke of it serving as a \"jolt of reality\" which underlines \"unimaginable, despicable horrors and abuse and neglect in care that we always thought happened in other countries, happened here.\n\n\"They happened at scale and they destroyed lives,\" she said. \"The pages of those stories tell us that they were young, they were vulnerable and they were terrified. They repeatedly spoke truth to those who they thought were there to protect them ... the abuse was covered up and the investigations were botched or entirely absent.\"\n\nShe grew notably emotional as she spoke of young unwed mothers in homes having been deliberately underfed \"because [the care providers] wanted to have easy births and small babies and then they drugged them up and they took their babies, they never got to hold them. That is confronting\".\n\nShe said Cabinet would consider the findings and the 138 recommendations, but the government would prioritise redress because many of the survivors were older, sick or had already died and \"we know that time is of the essence\".\n\n\"We are taking a number of Cabinet papers, we've already taken a couple of high-level Cabinet papers, there'll be a number of Cabinet papers taken before the end of the year, what we've done with the redress is taken it in parts because it's very big and very broad.\"\n\nAsked if he expected the redress to cost billions, Luxon said \"we're gonna do it right ... we'll work with survivor groups along that process but I haven't given thought to the dollars, it's not about the dollars\".\n\nThey would engage with the report and recommendations in good faith, with careful consideration, and would provide more clarity on the response by November, they promised.\n\n\"I have heard the survivors loud and clear, they must be at the heart of all of the work that we do,\" Stanford said.\n\nOne of the core volumes from the nearly 3000-page report links the effects of abuse in care with gang membership, but Luxon - asked what he would tell gang members - said: \"I understand many gang members came from very dysfunctional upbringings ... but also we can't have gang members causing pain and suffering.\"\n\nHe said it may well be that gangs would end up accessing some funding and supports provided through the redress process, but \"gangs today cause pain and suffering to their fellow citizens\".\n\nBut he also said the government was determined to solve the problems identified \"at the top of the cliff, rather than at the bottom of the cliff\".\n\nLabour leader Chris Hipkins said he \"absolutely and without question\" was committed to working in a bipartisan way on redress.\n\n\"The abuse in state care has happened over generations, it's happened over successive governments of all different persuasions, it's vitally important that Parliament comes together, that we rise above politics, that we focus on properly addressing the underlying causes of the abuse in state care and that we put things right.\"\n\nHe also said it would take time, and the next steps would also span multiple governments.\n\n\"This should not be about politics in any way, this must be about doing the right thing.\"\n\nHe said immediate changes to the setup of the redress system was set up in 2021, \"with the intention that a fully revamped redress system would be put in place after the Royal Commission had delivered its final report\".", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Alice_(Gainesville,_Florida)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lake Alice (Gainesville, Florida)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Stanford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erica Stanford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Labour_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Labour Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hipkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hipkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--de7mJpQ_--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1721792206/4KMJGWJ_240724_Abuse_in_Care_PRESSER_6_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 1444, "textEnd": 1455}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

There were reports of abuse against a massive 14% of all clergypeople over the period the report covered.\n\nBut it was so much more widespread than that. The report estimated of the 655,000 New Zealanders in care between 1950 and 2019, 30 per cent or 200,000 were abused and many more neglected.\n\nThe true number of survivors could be much higher.\n\nThe memories are horrific.\n\nIn some cases, carers went to extremes to inflict as much pain as possible. Electric shocks, violence and sexual harm was common.\n\nThen there's the harm from vulnerable children simply being ignored, seen as less than others and shown no love.\n\nIn one example, staff at the Kimberley Centre in Levin, which ran for 61 years, took payment to allow outsiders to come in and rape young people in the centre's care.\n\nThen there are the youth boot camps, where a gun was brandished in front of young boys who were then raped. Eighty per cent were M\u0101ori.\n\nThere are too many stories to even scrape the surface. All of them are horrific. All of them make you feel sick.\n\nAll of them should explain why people who grew up in care went on to commit crime, join gangs, use drugs and display violence more than those who weren't exposed to such harm.\n\nThen there's the abusers.\n\nThe abusers were respected community members. They were unskilled workers and caregivers. They were educated professionals like teachers and medical staff including psychologists and psychiatrists. They were religious leaders. They were men and they were women. They were young and they were old.\n\nThey were horrific people who committed horrific crimes, and most of them were never held to account.\n\nOne survivor said they felt dirty, they felt incredibly vulnerable, and they thought if they spoke out they would be killed by their abusers.\n\nThis is the power the abusers had.\n\nThere were 138 recommendations from the report, including calling for apologies from the government, the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon said yesterday was a dark and sorrowful day in NZ's history.\n\nHe said he couldn't take away the pain but, but told survivors he believed them.\n\nThe Minister responsible for the report Erica Stanford said the abuse destroyed lives.\n\nShe mentioned the stories of the unwed mothers who were deliberately underfed because the staff wanted to have easy births and small babies.\n\nThe mothers were then drugged up and had their children taken. They never got to hold them.\n\nShe says it will take time to work through the report's recommendations and options for redress. And that's where our minds turn today. What are the next steps?\n\nA formal apology in November aims to provide more clarity on the next steps, but the focus now has to be on two things.\n\nOne; redress for everything that happened. And two; a proper plan to ensure something like this never happens again.\n\nThe most horrific part of the story to me is that so many people in positions of power knew this was going on.

In 2021 and 2022, Australian courts ordered payouts to survivors of A$2,632,319, A$1,498,122, and A$1,908,647. In New Zealand, victims are currently receiving up to $30,000 under a rapid payment scheme.\n\nThe inquiry viewed that the Government should compare what most survivors in New Zealand receive through ACC with what survivors overseas in comparable countries such as Australia can access through court cases.\n\nAccording to the report, survivors have received little to no financial compensation from the ACC scheme, which is meant to provide fair compensation, rehabilitation and other assistance.\n\n\"For that, and other reasons, the inquiry considered survivors should be able to seek a public decision from the courts and to have their claim for compensation assessed. Survivors in other countries including Australia have these rights, as well as access to out-of-court redress schemes.\n\n\"In contrast, there is little scope in Aotearoa New Zealand to bring a case to court for abuse in care outside of the accident compensation scheme. As a result, very few cases have been brought, there are no recent high compensation awards, and the risk for defendants is generally low. These factors impact on the comparatively low amounts offered in settlements.\"\n\nHowever, the report stated that \"despite the gravity of these issues\", it remains unclear whether the Government accepts there is a problem concerning civil litigation settings and the ACC scheme.\n\nThe Minister responsible for co-ordinating the Crown Response to the Abuse in Care Inquiry, Erica Stanford said the Government is prioritising decisions around improving redress.\n\n\"Other recommendations will require more time to consider and respond to, particularly those involving legislative and major organisational change. We will provide an update by November.\"\n\nStandford said the first step was a formal apology which will take place on November 12.\n\nCurrently, survivors of abuse and neglect in care can receive up to $25,000 from the Government but exactly how much they collect depends on the length of time they spent in care.\n\nThe Ministry of Social Development's (MSD) rapid payment scheme states survivors who spent less than five years in care will receive $10,000, while the set sum for five to 15 years is $20,000, and for 15 years or more, it is $25,000.\n\nThis is based on MSD's view that the longer a person spends in state care, the more likely it is that they were harmed repeatedly.\n\nIn the report, which details the scheme, the inquiry found that using time spent in care as the main criterion was concerning.\n\n\"There is a risk that survivors who have spent a long time in care and experienced lower-level abuse will receive more (even substantially) than survivors who have spent a short time in care yet suffered higher-level abuse (such as multiple rapes).\n\n\"A survivor who experienced this type of abuse could choose an individualised assessment, but that would likely take years under MSD's timeframes.\"\n\nThe inquiry had recommended the Government create a mechanism to make advance payments to survivors who were at significant risk of being unable to apply to the pending redress scheme because of serious ill health or age.\n\nIt further recommended that applicants for an advance payment should only have to provide a statutory declaration that they were abused rather than evidence, that an advance payment should be the same amount for every survivor, and that those who received the payment should retain their right to also claim once the scheme had been established.\n\nBut the Government did not endorse the inquiry's recommendations on advance payments.\n\nInstead, MSD introduced the rapid payment scheme in December 2022, and made it available to any survivor who has made a claim, not just survivors who are ill or elderly.\n\nA survivor who accepts a rapid payment from MSD has to sign an agreement settling their claims against MSD, and it is unclear whether survivors who accept the payment will have access to any new scheme.\n\nWhile the rapid payment amounts differ based on a survivor's time spent in care, additional amounts may be added where the survivor has raised concerns relating to bush programmes run by non-governmental organisations in isolated settings, inappropriate detention and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.\n\nBut the maximum rapid payment available is $30,000.\n\nA survivor who receives a rapid payment may also choose to receive their care records, access counselling, receive \"an apology for their experience\", and tell MSD what happened to them.\n\nThe inquiry had several concerns about the scheme, including that no determination is made in the rapid payment process about whether MSD accepts the survivor's claims about that abuse.\n\n\"The actual abuse suffered by the survivor is irrelevant or mostly irrelevant to the amount received as a rapid payment. It is difficult for the Inquiry to see how MSD can offer meaningful apologies to survivors for abuse if it has not accepted that the abuse occurred.\"\n\nAccording to the report, MSD is also endeavouring to settle claims from a group of survivors made under the Privacy Act 2020 relating to MSD's alleged failure to provide their care records on time.\n\nUp to $17,000 could be paid out for the delays, based on a banding approach. The inquiry was \"very concerned\" that a survivor from this group could receive more from MSD, or not much less, for a delay in providing records than the survivor could receive as a rapid payment in return for settling abuse claims against the ministry.\n\n\"Such an outcome seems neither logical nor fair.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Education runs a similar rapid payment scheme for survivors of abuse at Waimokoia Residential School with the maximum sum available being $20,000.\n\nHowever, monetary restitution was only one aspect of the report.\n\nIt otherwise detailed the scale of the abuse and neglect that occurred in the care of New Zealand state and faith-based institutions from 1950 to 2019.\n\nSurvivors who suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse, severe exploitation and neglect, shared their experiences and their subsequent life-long pain and trauma.\n\nIt examined how the abuse and neglect was able to occur, how it persisted for decades, and its lasting individual and collective impacts.\n\nAnd it provided a clear pathway to help put right the deep harm done to survivors.\n\nThe inquiry described it as a \"national catastrophe\" that at least 200,000 children, young people and adults endured abuse and neglect at the hands of leaders who had a duty to nurture, protect and help people flourish.\n\nIt warned that if the injustices were not addressed, it would remain a stain on our national character forever.\n\n\"There must be no further delay... Aotearoa New Zealand must not put survivors through further hurt,\" the report insisted.\n\nCalls were made for key leaders including the Prime Minister, the Pope, and the heads of all faith\u2011based institutions across New Zealand to issue public acknowledgments and apologies to survivors for the decades of atrocities.\n\nNew Zealand Police were asked to establish a specialist unit dedicated to investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the abuse, and the inquiry also called for a review of the appropriateness of street names and public amenities named after a proven perpetrator.\n\nAn investigation into potential unmarked graves and urup\u0101 at the sites of former psychiatric and psychopaedic hospitals, social welfare institutions, or other relevant sites was recommended, and courts were advised to prioritise civil proceedings regarding abuse and neglect in care.\n\nThe report, released more than five years after its terms of reference were announced and decades after survivors first called for redress, blasted the Government and faith-based institutions for their failure to implement the initial 95 recommendations made in the inquiry's 2021 interim report on redress.\n\nThose recommendations, if implemented, would establish a new scheme to provide holistic redress for survivors.\n\nThe scheme would aim to restore the power, dignity and standing of those affected by abuse in care, without them having to go to court, and take effective steps to prevent abuse.\n\nIt would fit within what the inquiry referred to as the \"puretumu torowh\u0101nui system\", which is the wider system of services, laws, policies and organisations, including the courts, that have a role in providing different types of holistic redress and preventing or responding to abuse, harm and trauma in care.\n\n\"Since then, there has been very little clear progress by the Government in implementing the Inquiry's recommendations.\n\n\"Timeframes in He Purapura Ora, he M\u0101ra Tipu [the interim report] have not been met, and the Government has not met the timeframes it set itself.\n\n\"The steps the Government has taken to date are inconsistent in important respects with the recommendations of the Inquiry.\"\n\nThe inquiry found there have been positive initiatives but many survivors continued to have no effective remedy.\n\n\"In comparison to Australia, many survivors in Aotearoa New Zealand have a second or third-class system. Unless significant change occurs, this will continue to be the case.\"\n\nIn today's report, the first recommendation insisted that the Government implement the new puretumu torowh\u0101nui, or holistic redress, system and scheme as an immediate priority.\n\n\"Survivors have been told that they matter, they are respected for their courage, and they have been heard. Some apologies have been given, and a national apology is being planned.\n\n\"The Inquiry considers much more needs to be done, mostly led by the Government. And Government needs to act promptly so that survivors do not continue to die without receiving effective, holistic redress ...\n\n\"An apology is hollow without change ... There must be no further delay.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tara_shaskey@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "Tara Shaskey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wh\u0101nau", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wh\u0101nau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merck & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rehabilitation (penology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Stanford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erica Stanford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Bill_of_Rights_Act_1990", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Social_Development_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_declaration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statutory declaration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Education (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_(demon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mara (demon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Indian residential school system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/6P3CZX5DRBHKJFVOHXVTFRRCAI.jpg?auth=8b59d252be1acc4f5e60c0b0a5a2c7db85bb3970bdef9b6c84dcc09511fa1443&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 3475, "textEnd": 3486}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

She says the report must galvanise real action that makes change, and welcomes the Government's announcement that it will make a formal apology in November.\n\n\"Today I'm acknowledging the deep courage of those survivors who have shared their experiences through the Inquiry, and all those who could not, including those who have died while in care. Any abuse experienced by a child or young person creates lifelong and often intergenerational trauma. It's now up to us all to listen deeply to your life experiences and mamae, to support healing, act on your voices and solutions, and work together to build a safer future for all children and young people.\n\n\"I will continue listening to the voices and experiences of children and young people who have been abused in care, and amplifying their collective calls to action. Children and young people who come into the State care and protection system have already experienced harm. The State has a duty to ensure that they are safe while in its care. Its continued failures over decades to fulfil this duty of care must be addressed.\n\n\"While the Inquiry's report spans experiences from 1950 - 1999, we know that widespread abuse in State and faith-based care did not end then. The Inquiry has heard from rangatahi who have experienced abuse in care much more recently.\n\n\"In fact, we know that abuse in the State care and protection and youth justice system is continuing to harm children and young people. Just this month, Mana Mokopuna - Children and Young People's Commission published two new OPCAT monitoring reports outlining the significant concerns we had about the treatment of mokopuna in two State-run youth justice residences that we visited in February 2024, including findings of ill-treatment of mokopuna in one of these residences,\" says Dr Achmad.\n\nOfficial data from Oranga Tamariki shows an increasing number of children and young people are experiencing harm in care. The percentage of children in care with findings of harm - including physical, sexual and emotional harm, and neglect - increased from 5.65% in 2019, to 9% of children in 2023. That's a total of 519 children who were harmed in care over the past year, with 894 recorded findings of harm, despite the number of children in care declining over this period.\n\n\"Whanaketia, together with the Royal Commission of Inquiry's earlier report, He Purapura Ora, he M\u0101ra Tipu: From Redress to Puretumu Torowh\u0101nui, is the outcome of the most significant inquiry undertaken in Aotearoa New Zealand. We must learn from the findings and transform the way we care for children and young people now and into the future. This means listening to and acting on the voices of survivors of abuse in care, honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and making ours a nation where every single child and young person grows up loved, safe and well with their wh\u0101nau and connected to their whakapapa, flourishing to their full potential.\"\n\nThe report highlights the over-representation and harsher treatment of certain groups, particularly tamariki and rangatahi M\u0101ori, resulting in intergenerational impacts on survivors' children and grandchildren, and collectively by hap\u016b and iwi.\n\n\"Every case of child abuse, neglect and maltreatment is one too many. We must focus on strengthening families and wh\u0101nau so they can keep their mokopuna safe, we must see increased Government investment in iwi, kaupapa M\u0101ori and community organisations, and our care system must be safe for all mokopuna, upholding the rights of mokopuna M\u0101ori as M\u0101ori, Pacific children, children with disabilities and Rainbow mokopuna.\n\n\"This is not a one-off call to action, but something we need to work continuously on as a nation. It's all of our responsibility to end the horrific abuse that is undeniably part of our recent history and our present, so we make Aotearoa New Zealand a safe, caring and inclusive place to be a child.\"", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_Movement", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mana Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Children's_Commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office of the Children's Commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oranga_Tamariki", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oranga Tamariki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty of Waitangi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whakapapa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whakapapa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hap\u016b", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hap\u016b"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iwi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wh\u0101nau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wh\u0101nau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer and Support", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

The response cannot be rushed.

You knew then it was wrong, and all these years later, the state also acknowledges it was wrong.\n\n\"Today, I humbly stand before you in this house to offer a long overdue apology to the survivors of Lake Alice.

Because of you, we know the truth about the abuse and the trauma that you endured.\"\n\nThe inquiry clearly identified M\u0101ori made up the majority of an estimated 200,000 people abused in state care between 1950 and 1999. It said tamariki, rangatahi and pakeke M\u0101ori were often targeted because of their ethnicity.\n\n\"M\u0101ori, Pacific, deaf and disabled people disproportionately bore the brunt of a lot of what occurred, and not only did this have a devastating impact on your life, but also your families and your communities,\" said Luxon.\n\nThe report found the unstable and harmful environments M\u0101ori were exposed to in state care compounded the intergenerational trauma and normalised the 'revolving door experience' many M\u0101ori became accustomed too.\n\nGary Gerbes suffered horrific abuse in the 1950s while in state care, and shared his experience in the inquiry. He passed away in May, and was one of many who did not live to see the acknowledgement or apology.\n\nTo honour his memory, members of his whanau and his children attended a hikoi to Parliament wearing t-shirts honouring his memory.\n\nHis daughter Jessie James told RNZ: \"For my dad, it wasn't about chasing money or payment - it was just about acknowledgement and the people responsible owning up to what they did.\"\n\nShe said the trauma her father endured led to him seeking a wh\u0101nau connection elsewhere as one of the founding members of the Mongrel Mob.\n\n\"My dad was isolated from his wh\u0101nau in the system, so people he had never met before ended up becoming his 'brothers' - those were the other young boys he was in the system with. Their experience led to my dad becoming the Mongrel Mob in Korau Beach. When you are treated like your nothing you find a connection wherever you can.\"\n\nSam Troth, who survived physical and sexual abuse while in state care, said he expected immediate action and swift implementation of the 138 recommendations offered up in the report.\n\n\"No one can claim ignorance anymore - the evidence and the answers are there. The time for talking is over, transformation has to start now.\"\n\nThe prime minister announced a formal apology would be issued to survivors at Parliament on 12 November, and the minister responsible Erica Stanford would establish a working group to review the recommendations in the report.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wh\u0101nau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wh\u0101nau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H\u012bkoi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "H\u012bkoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Stanford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erica Stanford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongrel_Mob", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mongrel Mob"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--EtjWeYD9--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1721807059/4KMIYI7_Gary_Gerbes_2_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758253", "eventUri": "eng-9758253", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 2719, "textEnd": 2730}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

In particular, M\u0101ori were targeted for their ethnicity and prevented from exercising tino rangatiratanga (ultimate power and authority) over k\u0101inga (home), as guaranteed in Article 2 of te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nBoth the principles of the Treaty, especially active protection and partnership, and the Treaty itself were found to have been breached by the Crown's failure to address and adequately redress the harm caused while in care. The Treaty of Waitangi is New Zealand's founding constitutional document, signed by M\u0101ori and the British Crown in 1840.\n\nAmong the 138 recommendations contained in the report is an official apology by the Prime Minister and other key leaders, civil and criminal legislative amendments, including to the Crimes Act 1961, Sentencing Act 2002, and Evidence Act 2006, as well as state partnership with M\u0101ori to give effect to te Tiriti o Waitangi and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Establishing a holistic system to address the harm caused, a recommendation proposed originally in a report released by the commission in 2021, was also restated.\n\nAcross its nine volumes, the report details pervasive cases of physical, emotional, mental, and sexual abuse, as well as severe exploitation and neglect that affected victims, including the application of electric shocks and misuse of solitary confinement. The cost of abuse to New Zealand society has been estimated by the commission to have been as high as NZD 217 billion.\n\nPublication of the report has not come without opposition, however. On Tuesday, the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses unsuccessfully sought in the Court of Appeal to restrain a section of the report involving instances of abuse by members of the faith.\n\nIn his speech to Parliament, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon joined lawmakers in acknowledging the weight of the occasion:\n\nThe State was supposed to care for you - but instead many of you were subjected to the most horrendous physical, emotional, mental, and sexual abuse... M\u0101ori, Pacific, deaf and disabled people disproportionately bore the brunt of a lot of what occurred. Not only has this had a devastating impact on your life, but also on your families and communities. We like to think that abuse like this doesn't happen here in New Zealand.

When you would be listened to and believed and told that the fault for what has happened to you, the grievous hurt that you have suffered, is not your fault.\n\nIt's the fault of sadistic, depraved adults who should never have been put in the position of looking after vulnerable children. It's the fault of organisations that were so hell bent on protecting their holy reputations, that rather than punishing the abuser, they just sent him away, giving them new opportunities to hurt and destroy the lives of more young children.\n\nWhen you look at your own children or grandchildren, 7-year-old boys and girls - look at them - they are beautiful humans. Half baby, half child but you can see the full adult they're starting to become.\n\nSo full of potential, so full of promise and they love life and they love you, and they trust you, and you wonder how on Earth any adult could betray that trust and brutally hurt the bodies and souls of those children?\n\nWell wonder no more. 2944 pages of evidence will tell you exactly how adults did that.\n\nIt's the largest and most complex inquiry ever held in New Zealand, and thank you to all of those who took part. The Commission members, which must have been a grueling job and the witnesses.\n\nThe Royal Commission of Inquiry into Historical Abuse in State and Faith-Based Care was six years in the making. And every page is a page of families. Families in the first instance, who either neglected their children, couldn't be bothered with their children, abused their children sufficiently, that the state intervened, and then in came the institutions and the churches.\n\nAnd they all failed these beautiful, vulnerable young people they were supposed to be protecting. The report was released to the public yesterday afternoon. It contains 138 recommendations and Parliament acknowledged receipt of the report, with speakers from across the House:\n\n\"We like to think that abuse like this doesn't happen here in Aotearoa, New Zealand but it did, and it is a shameful chapter of our history that we must confront. And Mr. Speaker, this is a dark and sorrowful day in New Zealand's history. And it's important that as a country, we bring to the surface and we understand the hard truths of what happened so we can try and move forward together. And I say to the survivors, the burden is no longer yours to carry alone. The state is now standing here beside you, accountable and ready to take action.\"\n\nThat was Prime Minister Christopher Luxon. This is leader of the opposition Chris Hipkins:\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, I want to address the Prime Minister and thank him for his words. Our government set up this inquiry and we made some changes. We changed the redress rules on an interim basis and we did set up the Survivor Experiences Board, but Prime Minister, we didn't do enough. And the ball now falls to you and your Government. This must be bigger than politics. Mr. Speaker, we owe it to the survivors and to future generations to finally deliver justice, and to finally end the ongoing abuse that happens in state care. This work will extend beyond the life of any one government, so we should work together to make sure that happens.\"\n\nWhich is quite true. And finally, Minister in Charge of the Crown Response to the Abuse in Care Inquiry, Erica Stanford:\n\n\"These are our most vulnerable and damaged tamariki, and this report tells us today that we must do better. And as a government, we are committed to delivering our response to the report with the respect and dignity it deserves. But today is about the survivors. Today we hear your stories. Today we acknowledge your bravery. And your bravery will not only correct the historic record, but it will determine our future. You are brave, we acknowledge you and we thank you.\"\n\nThe report is really, really important and it has to be a lesson of what not to do in the future. In the first instance, it is families who are failing these children. If families were doing a good job, if families could protect their own children, they wouldn't need to be taken away from them.\n\nAnd as we have seen, there are woeful families committing grievous harm on their children every single day. Oranga Tamariki is worked off its feet and failing miserably as an organisation, despite the best will of the social welfare workers, so the lessons from the past must be taken into the future because we haven't fixed anything.\n\nThe only good thing that's happened in the past 50 or 60 years is that people can speak up now. When I was growing up it was just starting to change, but when I was growing up the doctor, the policeman, the principal, the priest, they were believed. They were respected members of the community and if you had said that the local policeman had hurt you or tried to interfere with you, I'm not entirely sure you'd have been believed. You'd have probably been told off by your parents for telling terrible wicked lies.\n\nWe had a paedophile priest roaming around St. John's, when my brother was at St. John's. The kids all knew he was a paedo. He'd come from somewhere else where he'd been a paedo. But rather than the church defrock him and expose him, they sent him along to another school to commit more damage.\n\nAnd my brother said he wasn't going to be an altar boy anymore and mum wept because every Catholic mother wants the child to be an altar boy. Won't you change your mind? No. He wasn't going to change his mind any time soon.\n\nAnd Mum said later, many years later when it all came out that this man was a filthy depraved, opportunistic, intelligent, sadistic, paedophile, that even if my brother had said anything, she's not entirely sure she'd have believed him because she wouldn't have thought it was possible. A priest? A priest did what?\n\nSuch was the power of the church and of authority figures in the 70s, 60s, 50s, 40s. They were almost omnipotent. Nobody could stop them if they decided to do what they wanted and like finds like.\n\nPaedos find other paedos. They like sharing their filthy little secrets. The only thing that's changed I think from back then is that the covers of darkness have been stripped away and those ghastly sluggish paedos have been exposed to the full light of day.\n\nThere is still the most appalling abuse happening in homes. There is still abuse happening in institutions, as we've seen with the reviews of Oranga Tamariki, but it's being exposed far more quickly and hopefully we are learning better ways of doing things.\n\nBut it will be the kids themselves, who had to go through hell on Earth who will be the ones who'll be able to inform us on how to do things better. But in the first instance, love your kids, don't let them end up in care, don't hand over their souls and their bodies to other people who are going to damage them.

The previous Government started a process for creating an independent system of redress, and finishing this - including how much money to put towards it - is a priority for Luxon in the coming months.\n\nWhanaketia contains a further 138 recommendations, which centre on key themes.\n\nOne is that survivors of abuse and neglect deserve special treatment in the justice system. This is a recognition of the state's negligence contributing to the damage they suffered, and to any crimes they may have committed afterwards.\n\nThe recommendations would make it more likely for any of their allegations of abuse to lead to prosecutions (their complaints would weigh more heavily on the \"public interest\" scale). Any crimes of violence or neglect when they were under 18 years of age would lead to a longer sentence (a wider net than the current age threshold of up to 14).\n\nIf survivors were convicted of a crime themselves, a judge would be more lenient in sentencing when considering any previous convictions - including from the Youth Court - for offending that happened \"in response to abuse and/or neglect in care\".\n\nSpecial treatment would extend to timeliness, due to civil proceedings for survivors being prioritised, and to legal aid, which they should have easier access to.\n\nCommissioners also want a $10,000 cash payment to families cared for by abuse survivors, a recognition of ongoing intergenerational trauma; this is a fraction of the estimated average lifetime cost to a survivor ($857,000) of what they'd missed out on if they'd had a normal life.\n\nLuxon might well agree that those who suffered at the hands of the state are entitled to special rights in the justice system, as well as $10,000 cash for their families.\n\nThe conundrum is that many of those who were abused in state care ended up in gangs, which provided them with a sense of security and belonging.\n\nThere will be some gang members who were never in state care, and some survivors of abuse who never joined a gang. But many gang members are also survivors; the Waitangi Tribunal estimates between 80% to 90% of Mongrel Mob and Black Power members spent time in state care.\n\n\"Gang wh\u0101nau are a product of the state,\" says Arewa Ake te Kaupapa, a submission to the Royal Commission following a hui last year with more than 200 gang wh\u0101nau, including members of the Mongrel Mob, Black Power, Head Hunters and King Cobras.\n\nMany joined after leaving state care. Others signed up while still institutionalised, or even beforehand.\n\n\"Recruitment to gangs while in State Care set a number of rangatahi on a pathway to prison, with a significant subsequent effect on their life trajectories,\" independent research to the Royal Commission said.\n\n\"A gang presence was intermittent in the 1960s but became increasingly apparent in State Care institutions in the 1970s. In 1981, for example, youths with gang affiliations accounted for more than 80% of admissions to Auckland's Owairaka Boys' Home. More recently, foster homes have become a key site for gang recruitment.\"\n\nA typical experience is that of former King Cobras member Feke Taito, who learned to steal cars, pick locks, and use cannabis while at Owairaka, putting him on an inevitable pathway.\n\n\"My family and I were not offered support at the time I was taken into care. Instead, I was removed and placed in an environment where I was moved closer towards a gang lifestyle,\" he told the commission.\n\n\"This was partly through my introduction to crimes and offending and drugs at Owairaka and then being placed in close proximity to older, hardened criminals at the halfway house, at Waikeria [youth reform facility] and at Mt Eden Corrections Facility as a young man [age 17].\"\n\nThere's a tendency to view joining a gang as a choice rather than due to \"structural issues that contribute to gang joining and subsequent offending\", according to the Prime Minister's chief science adviser's report on gang harm.\n\nBut for some, \"their gang joining was largely facilitated by the state\".\n\nThis continues to this day, the report said; a sample of 2000 gang members in their early 20s were more \"likely than the population average to have contact with OT [Oranga Tamariki], experience an OT investigation, and to be placed in state care.\"\n\nThere are also many survivors of abuse in state care who didn't join a gang and went on to live fulfilling lives. This lends weight to the Government's view that joining a gang is more of a choice, and less of a consequence of structural issues.\n\n\"There are many things that are associated with crime, such as terrible upbringings and violent upbringings and poverty and a whole host of issues, but not everybody in that category chooses to go and have a life of crime,\" Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith told the Justice Select Committee in June.\n\n\"And so you can never lose sight of the need for individual responsibility and that people need to be held to account for their actions. And that's a fundamental part of our approach to justice.\"\n\nOr, in Luxon's oft-repeated words, gang members have chosen to peddle in misery and suffering, and they should lose certain rights for that.\n\nThat includes the right to freedom of expression (because gang patches will be banned in public places), peaceful assembly (due to the police power to disperse a gang gathering), and freedom of association (due to anti-consorting orders).\n\nThese are included in the Government's anti-gang legislation, which also adds gang membership as an aggravating factor at sentencing regardless of whether it has anything to do with the crime.\n\nConsider this push-pull scenario: a gang member who is also an abuse survivor comes before a judge for sentencing after being convicted of a crime. He has a host of previous convictions that would normally lead to a longer sentence, but they're considered \"in response to the abuse\" he suffered in state care.\n\nThe judge must ensure he's not \"unduly penalised\" for these convictions, in accordance with the commission's recommendations. But under the Government's law change, his sentence must also be longer because he is a gang member.\n\nSome leniency, then, for what arose from the harm the state is responsible for, but the opposite for what the pathway from that harm led him to.\n\nCommissioners want the state care system to be overhauled, with an independent agency and new legislation reflecting te Tiriti and its principles - including in its design, and how it operates - as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Undrip).\n\nTheir report notes te Tiriti principles of partnership, active protection and equity, all of which would be erased under a bill Luxon's Government is putting together - although Luxon has said he will kill the bill after its first reading.\n\nThe Government has also stopped putting references to the Treaty in legislation, and is reviewing current ones. In some cases, such as the government directive to Pharmac, Treaty references have been dumped.\n\nMeanwhile, all work on implementing the Undrip has ceased.\n\nFunding has also been frozen (pending a review) for the rollout of Te Ao M\u0101rama, the court programme that commissioners want the Government to \"support and invest in\" because it recognises and addresses the harm caused in state care.\n\nAnd commissioners want all state care placements to be as close to the family or wh\u0101nau as practicable. This was the aim of section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act - whether it was successful is another question - which the Government is repealing, saying it led to a divisive system.\n\nLuxon did not resile from his gang policies in today's press conference, nor did he say whether he was willing to give cash payments and special justice treatment to survivors, a group that will include some gang members.\n\n\"Gangs in New Zealand huge pain and suffering - that is unacceptable. We are determined that gangs cannot peddle harm and suffering on their fellow citizens,\" he said.\n\nThe Government will issue a formal apology on November 12, and use the time until then to work its way through the recommendations.\n\nLuxon may find a way to continue his Government's direction while meeting the commissioners' broad goals.\n\nHe could adopt special rights and cash payments for survivors but exclude gang members - whether this would be fair is a separate question - which would then become incentives to leave a gang.\n\nDumping section 7AA doesn't necessarily doom a wh\u0101nau-centred approach to state help and state care, and the Government has other programmes - such as Social Investment 2.0 and Wh\u0101nau Ora - supporting such an approach.\n\nHe might create an independent Care Safe Agency, supported by new legislation, that's effective and inclusive - especially for M\u0101ori, Pasifika, the deaf, and the disabled - without referencing te Tiriti.\n\nLuxon said the Government would provide \"clarity\" by the end of the year. What that entails will reveal what he thinks is necessary - and what he can shelve - to remedy the shameful wrongs of the past, and prevent history repeating.\n\n* Phone the police on 111 or ask neighbours or friends to ring for you.* Run outside and head for where there are other people. Scream for help so your neighbours can hear you.* Take the children with you. Don't stop to get anything else.* If you are being abused, remember it's not your fault.

Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDavid Malukas was recently released by Arrow McLaren after missing the first four races of the 2024 IndyCar season, including the exhibition race at Thermal Club, with a wrist injury he suffered in an offseason mountain biking accident.\n\nCallum Ilott and Theo Pourchaire have both replaced him in two events so far this season, with Ilott standing in for the season opener on the streets of St. Petersburg, Florida and in the exhibition race at Thermal Club. Pourchaire made the first two starts of his IndyCar career in the races on the streets of Long Beach, California and at Barber Motorsports Park.\n\nArrow McLaren have now confirmed that the No. 6 Chevrolet is officially set to be driven by Pourchaire for the remainder of the 2024 season, excluding the Indy 500.\n\nPourchaire has officially been named the driver of the No. 6 Chevrolet for this Saturday afternoon's Sonsio Grand Prix at the Indianapolis road course, and he is set to return to the cockpit for the rest of the season starting with the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix on the streets of Detroit, Michigan on Sunday, June 2.\n\nIlott is still expected to drive the No. 6 Chevrolet at Indianapolis Motor Speedway later this month due to his oval experience and his participation in last month's open test at the four-turn, 2.5-mile (4.023-kilometer) Speedway, Indiana oval in place of Malukas.\n\nIn his second Indy 500 start last year, he started 27th, led five laps, and finished in 12th place, just three spots shy of his career-best oval finish of ninth at Texas Motor Speedway.\n\nIlott, not Pourchaire, was also included in this year's Indy 500 media guide, a tell-tale sign that he is indeed set to be the 34th and final confirmed driver on the entry list, unless Arrow McLaren pull off a major surprise and put Tony Kanaan in the car for yet another \"last lap\" retirement tour.\n\nPourchaire was the biggest mover in his IndyCar debut, starting 22nd and finishing in 11th place in Long Beach. Late contact with teammate Pato O'Ward at Barber relegated last year's Formula 2 champion to a 22nd place finish.\n\nAll signs seem to be pointing toward Pourchaire running the full schedule with Arrow McLaren in 2025 as well after he recently took part in an oval test. Whether or not the team find a way to also make room for Ilott, whom they were known to be quite high on ahead of last year's free agency when he was still under contract with Juncos Hollinger Racing, remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "beyondtheflag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beyond the Flag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arrow McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th\u00e9o_Pourchaire", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Th\u00e9o Pourchaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_of_St._Petersburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix of St. Petersburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Malukas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Malukas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Ilott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Callum Ilott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Grand_Prix_(IndyCar)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Grand Prix (IndyCar)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barber Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedway,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speedway, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Speedway, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juncos_Hollinger_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juncos Hollinger Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pato_O'Ward", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pato O'Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Two", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kanaan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Kanaan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Motor Speedway"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Karting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4190,h_2356,x_0,y_434/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/243/01hxfdwdwxexnw7ektbm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554674", "eventUri": "eng-9554674", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 1159, "textEnd": 1165}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The decision comes just over a week after the program dropped the injured David Malukas before he could run a single race for the team.\n\nAs the reigning F2 champion, Pourchaire is effectively the most qualified young driver not currently racing in F1. The 20-year-old Frenchman also won the German F4 championship, finished second in his debut season of FIA Formula 3, and secured a runner-up finish in his second of three F2 seasons.\n\nPourchaire started filling in at McLaren when initial fill-in driver Callum Ilott had a schedule conflict due to his FIA World Endurance Championship commitments with the Jota Porsche 963 program, making him an effective reserve to the reserve. He finished 11th on debut at Long Beach, impressing the team with his adjustment not just to the IndyCar chassis but to a street circuit unlike anything he experienced in Europe. He finished a disappointing 22nd in his follow-up race at Long Beach, but the performance over two weekends was enough to earn a longer opportunity with the Papaya-clad team.\n\nWhile Pourchaire will not be running the Indianapolis 500 and the team's fill-in driver for the race has not yet been announced, he has already tested on an oval and plans to race in the year's remaining oval events. As there are all of zero oval races on the typical Formula 1 ladder, those races will mark a first in his young career.\n\nThe quick hire comes just 10 days after the team dropped David Malukas, who had seemingly been signed as a long-term part of the organization in the past offseason. Malukas, who was injured on a mountain bike in February, finished second with seven wins in the 2021 Indy Lights championship and secured eight top 10 IndyCar finishes over two seasons with the relatively uncompetitive Dale Coyne Racing. Malukas is now a free agent, making him both the favored replacement for any in-season driver change at any other team and a key player in any opportunities for the 2025 season.\n\nWhen Pourchaire initially ran as a one-off driver at Long Beach, he told Road & Track that he first heard about the possibility just two and a half weeks before the race. Pourchaire added that it \"would be a dream, to drive full time\" in the series, including the oval races that have kept some drivers from the European ladder from considering the series in the past. At the same event, Zak Brown toldRoad & Track that the team was \"hot on the driver market\" even while Malukas was still under contracted and noted that the end of current driver Alexander Rossi's contract was coming up soon, too.\n\nDropping Malukas already opened at least one seat at McLaren in 2025, and the potential to let Alexander Rossi walk could open a second. That is good news for Pourchaire, who will not only be able to approach the remainder of the 2024 season as an extended audition but have the opportunity to do so with the confidence that Arrow McLaren has a real opportunity for him in the future.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

David Malukas would have had that ride at the beginning of the season, but he fractured his left wrist in a Mountain Bike crash in February and has yet to return to the car.\n\nWhen Malukas missed his fourth IndyCar Series race of the season, his contract was terminated by Arrow McLaren.\n\nEnter Pourchaire and England's Callum Ilott. Both drivers have shared the No. 6 Chevrolet at Arrow McLaren this season.\n\nIf Arrow McLaren choses Pourchaire for the Indy 500, he would have to complete the Rookie Orientation Program at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway when the track opens for the 108 Indianapolis 500 for practice on Tuesday, May 14.\n\nBy passing his oval test at the 1.33-mile oval located in Madison, Illinois across the Mississippi River from St. Louis on Monday, Pourchaire can also compete at other ovals on the IndyCar schedule including Iowa Speedway in July, World Wide Technology Raceway in August, The Milwaukee Mile on Labor Day Weekend and Nashville Superspeedway in September.\n\n\"We just finished the day here in St. Louis and It's been a great day,\" Pourchaire said after Monday's test. \"I was really happy that I was able to get back behind the wheel of the Arrow McLaren Indy car and to have this opportunity again was great.\n\n\"The first time for me on an oval was really exciting. I couldn't wait to feel the driving on an ovel. I can say it now, it's really quick really impressive. You have to be really smooth on the steering wheel, the steering inputs going back on power and be really smooth in the car.\n\n\"It feels amazing. I'm really happy. I'm really tired mentally as well because it's super quick and you don't want to do a mistake on a track like this. If you do a small mistake you can end up in the wall and we all know that ending up in the wall on an oval is really dangerous.\"\n\nArrow McLaren Sporting Director Tony Kanaan and fellow driver Alexander Rossi assisted Pourchaire during the test. Rossi set up the No. 6 Chevrolet and ran a few laps to get it up to speed before turning it over to Pourchaire for the remainder of the test.\n\n\"I enjoyed it and it's been a pretty good day,\" Pourchaire said. \"The pace was good and yeah, I would like to thank everybody on the team for giving me this opportunity once again and I would like to thanks, as well Tony Kanaan and Alexander Rossi for helping me today getting used to the Indy car on an ovel track.\n\n\"It was a good day.\"\n\nGavin Ward is the team principal at Arrow McLaren and oversees the three-car effort in IndyCar that includes Pato O'Ward of Mexico, Rossi and whoever the team ultimately chooses in the No. 6 Chevrolet.\n\nAt this year's Indianapolis 500, 2021 NASCAR Cup Series start Kyle Larson will join the team as he competes in the famed race for the first time in his career.\n\nWard told NBCSports.com that releasing Malukas was a difficult decision, but it had to be made for the team to move forward.\n\n\"It was a terrible situation,\" Ward said. \"And I said to David, 'There's nothing I want more than to bring him into this team and have him be a big success.'\n\n\"Definitely not an enjoyable process. process at all.\n\n\"I'm still trying to help him as much as possible and I do believe he'll get back in a car, and will race again, but at the end of the day, it's been a huge distraction for us when you're trying so hard with so much effort to try and catch the Penske's and Ganassi's of this world who have had to sustain huge investment and stability for so long.\n\n\"We've got work to do to catch up and it's been just a huge distraction to be finding replacement drivers and looking at, medical reports and not really knowing where we're going to land and dealing with the knockdown effect that has on our partners and our team. It's just such a distraction across the board.\"\n\nMalukas was hired by the team in early September 2023 for the ride that was supposed to go to two-time NTT IndyCar Series champion Alex Palou. He had signed a contract to join McLaren in 2022, but team owner Chip Ganassi invoked the option clause in his contract to keep Palou with Chip Ganassi Racing.\n\nPalou had a dominating season in 2023 and realized he had a great thing going with his team at CGR and broke his agreement with Arrow McLaren.\n\nMalukas was considered Plan B and the young driver from Chicago appeared to have a career-making ride.\n\nBut his Mountain Biking crash sidelined him and Malukas never turned a wheel in competition in the Arrow McLaren Chevrolet.\n\n\"Unfortunately, at some point you've got to look after the well-being of the team,\" Ward told NBC Sports.com. \"It's difficult decisions, not enjoyable in a lot of ways, but I guess that's part of the gig, and I'm trying.\n\n\"I said this when I took this job, I told the whole team,\n\n'Every decision I make here, I'm going to try and make with the best interests of the team at heart, what I think is best for the team. Some of those decisions may be right, may be wrong, may be liked, may be hated. But just rest assured that's going to be my approach. I will try and make the decision, difficult or easy with the team's best interest at heart.'\n\n\"I think this is another one, not an easy one, definitely.\"\n\nWard said if Malukas had fractured his wrist while racing in IndyCar, the team would have stood by him \"100 percent.\"\n\nBut the injury came out of the cockpit in what may be considered a \"risky recreational activity.\"\n\nIn some professional sports, contracts often prohibit such ventures as skiing.\n\n\"We're always looking at it,\" Ward said. \"There are different approaches and different teams take on that sort of stuff.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you hire a race car driver to drive your race car. And three months into this recovery still don't have clarity about when David was going to be fighting fit.\n\n\"At some point, you've got to make a decision.\n\n\"Without getting into specifics of contracts, you can either try and cover all scenarios by saying that a driver needs to be available to drive, X number of races, or you can specifically ban certain activities or what have you, and I see the different approaches out there.\n\n\"It's been a difficult time for us, we're always looking to learn how we can be better.\"\n\nWard hopes that Malukas will learn from this difficult decision. Ward confirmed he has certainly learned the difficulties of managing a top-level IndyCar Series team.\n\n\"I think there's always opportunities for us to figure out how to build a better race team,\" Ward said. \"And this is one where we definitely look at it like, 'OK, there's a couple of things we could do better next time.'\n\n\"But also, there's some things that are out of your control, and it's just been a tremendous necessary distraction when our competitors frankly don't have that.\n\n\"We already had quite a lot of distraction last year with the Alex Palou situation.\n\n\"I would be happy not to be involved in scrambling over a driver situation for a little while to be honest.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [],

Both drivers recorded top finishes of 11th place.\n\nWho the team will opt to add to their lineup for the Indy 500 has been the subject of speculation in the days following Malukas' release.\n\nThat driver is set to become one of four drivers, not just three, in the organization's lineup, as they have also added the No. 17 Chevrolet for 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Larson as he attempts to complete the Memorial Day Double for the first time. He is also set to return in 2025, when the No. 6 Chevrolet should presumably have a new full-time driver.\n\nIlott had been seen as the frontrunner over Pourchaire due to his past oval experience, as he competed full-time in IndyCar in 2022 and 2023. He also took part in last month's open test at Indianapolis, driving alongside O'Ward, Rossi, and Larson in place of Malukas.\n\nThe 25-year-old Briton was also believed to be Arrow McLaren's top choice to replace Felix Rosenqvist behind the wheel of the No. 6 Chevrolet once it was made clear that Alex Palou would not be available, but he was not released by Juncos Hollinger Racing until after Arrow McLaren had signed Malukas from Dale Coyne Racing.\n\nA \"wild card\" candidate really wasn't an option at this stage in the game, and Tony Kanaan, who now holds an advisory role with the team, has long been determined to make his 2023 \"last lap\" tour indeed his last.\n\nFormal confirmation has not been made regarding the driver of the No. 6 Chevrolet, but all signs point to Ilott getting the nod.\n\nFollowing confirmation that Abel Motorsports will not field the No. 50 Chevrolet for R.C. Enerson this year after doing so last year, the Indy 500 entry list became set at 34 entries. In this year's Indy 500 media guide, there are profiles for the 33 confirmed drivers.\n\nThe 34th profile is for Ilott, not Pourchaire or anybody else.\n\nIlott has two Indy 500 starts to his name, and he led five laps around the four-turn, 2.5-mile (4.023-kilometer) Speedway, Indiana oval last year after starting in 27th place. He finished in 12th, just three spots shy of his best career oval finish of ninth at Texas Motor Speedway earlier in the year.\n\nWith Indy 500 practice scheduled to begin on Tuesday, May 14 and qualifying scheduled to take place on Saturday, May 18 and Sunday, May 19, expect formal confirmation of Ilott's addition to Arrow McLaren's lineup to be made in due course. The 108th running of the Indy 500 itself is set to be broadcast live on NBC beginning at 11:00 a.m. ET on Sunday, May 26.", "source": {"uri": "beyondtheflag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beyond the Flag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arrow McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_All-Star_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR All-Star Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_of_St._Petersburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix of St. Petersburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pato_O'Ward", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pato O'Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Malukas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Malukas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Ilott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Callum Ilott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rossi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Rossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barber Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._C._Enerson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R.

Really impressive.\n\n\"You have to be really smooth on the steering wheel, steering inputs, going back on power and you have to be really smooth in the car. It feels amazing.\"\n\nThe unique challenge to learn the new track discipline also provided some mental fatigue when the day had wrapped up.\n\n\"I'm really tired mentally as well because it's going super quick and you don't want to do a mistake on a track like this,\" Pourchaire said.\n\n\"If you do a small mistake you can end up in the wall and we all know if you end up in the wall on an oval is really dangerous, but I enjoyed it.\n\n\"It's been a pretty good day. The pace was good and yeah, I would like to thank everyone on the team for giving me this opportunity. I would like to thank Tony and Alexander as well for helping me today getting used to an Indy car on an oval track. It was a good day.\"\n\nAccording to a team representative, Pourchaire has been given \"the green light from the series to compete on ovals in the future.\"\n\nOutside of his run at Long Beach, Pourchaire also raced for the team in the most recent round at Barber Motorsports Park, where he was running 18th on the penultimate lap before being punted out of the way by team-mate Pato O'Ward.\n\nAs of now, Pourchaire has not been confirmed for more races with the team.

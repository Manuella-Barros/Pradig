They made general comments on the Revised Draft Text of the ILBI, established contact groups, and began what are being called \"substantive discussions.\"\n\nAs reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, a division of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, delegates were \"quick to acknowledge that the road towards a new treaty is steep, and, at least at this point, a heavy mist still obscures the route.\"\n\nThe meeting opened with general statements, including from INC Chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso, Ecuador, who stressed the need to deliver an international legally binding instrument. In the opening session, key regional blocs outlined some key elements they want to see in a treaty: The Asia Pacific group said that countries should receive financial and technical assistance for waste management infrastructure as they take on new obligations under the agreement; and the Africa group called for the creation of a new multilateral fund to help developing countries meet new obligations under a treaty.\n\nAnd in line with the needs of different groups, some delegates stressed the need to address the entire lifecycle of plastic, while others prioritized addressing only plastic waste management, Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported.\n\nAs reported by Reuters news agency, Steven Guilbeault, Canada's environment minister, told the opening plenary: \"We now need to narrow down the options, identify where there is growing consensus and make real progress on the agreement\". He added that the pact should establish targets and eliminate unnecessary single-use plastics and chemicals.\n\nAlso on the first day, the INC established two contact groups that split off to keep working on sections of the draft text. The first, co-chaired by Palau and Germany, will look at the technical elements, while the second group, co-chaired by Australia and Ghana, will work on implementation measures.\n\nDeliberations in both groups will continue throughout the week.\n\nThe INC-4 meeting hasn't escaped the notice of some plastics industry groups, one of which cautioned the attendees against recommending heavy-handed bans against plastics. \"This meeting has the opportunity to be make or break for these negotiations,\" said Matt Seaholm president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based Plastics Industry Association. \"It will be a missed opportunity if we spend the week talking about how to stop the production of plastic. We need partners and remain hopeful attendees will come to the table in a spirit of compromise so that we can develop strategies to truly address plastic waste in the environment.\" This position is shared by the International Council of Chemical Associations, which urged the INC to accelerate actions that the plastics and chemical industry is already doing on its own, such as boosting recycling and redesigning plastic products.\n\nAnd a group of nations with important fossil fuel development economies is arguing against limiting production or banning certain chemicals. The group, which includes Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China, says the final INC treaty should focus only on tracking plastic waste.\n\nHosted by Canada's federal government, INC-4 is being held at Ottawa's Shaw Centre and will run from April 23 to April 29. The goal of the talks is to develop a treaty aimed at ending plastic pollution, including microplastics, from entering terrestrial and marine ecosystems by 2040. The three previous INC sessions, stretching back over several years, have resulted in a 69-page draft. INC negotiators in Ottawa are hoping to refine that text down to a list of core issues to be approved in a finished global treaty at the final upcoming session scheduled to take place in Busan, Republic of Korea, from Nov. 25 to Dec. 1.", "source": {"uri": "canplastics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canadian Plastics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Countries are under pressure to make progress on a first-ever global plastics treaty this week, but they face tense negotiations in the Canadian capital with parties deeply divided over what the treaty should include as talks kicked off on Tuesday.\n\nIf governments can agree on a legally binding treaty that addresses not just how plastics are discarded, but also how much plastic is produced and how it is used, the treaty could become the most significant pact to address global climate-warming emissions since the 2015 Paris Agreement. Global plastic treaty negotiations come as the European Parliament approved on Wednesday a proposed law that would ban certain single-use plastic packaging like mini shampoo bottles in hotels and thin plastic bags for groceries from 2030, in an attempt to curb the rising tide of packaging waste. Fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists When countries agreed in 2022 to negotiate a legally binding treaty by the end of this year, they called for addressing the full lifecycle of plastics - from production and use to waste. But as negotiations kick off in Ottawa, there is staunch opposition from the petrochemical lobby and some governments dependent on fossil fuels to limiting production or banning certain chemicals. In fact, nearly 200 fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyists plan to join this week's negotiations -- a 37% jump from the previous gathering in November, according to an analysis by CIEL, a nonprofit law group. During the U.N. talks on plastics in Nairobi, Kenya, last November, Saudi Arabia launched a coalition with countries including Russia, Iran, Cuba, China, and Bahrain called Global Coalition for Plastics Sustainability that says the treaty should focus only on tracking plastic waste and wants the treaty to focus on waste rather than production controls. The position is shared by the petrochemical industry. Saudi officials declined to comment. The biggest generator of plastic waste, the U.S., has refrained from joining the negotiating blocs. Measures proposed by U.S. negotiators include requiring countries to tackle certain chemicals that have raised public health concerns as well as \"single use\" plastic products that are deemed wasteful. Tackling production\n\nMore than 60 countries making up the so-called High-Ambition Coalition, including European Union members, Mexico, Australia, Japan and Rwanda - and most recently Ukraine - are also arguing for a strong treaty that tackles production and requires transparency and controls for chemicals used in the process. But unlike the U.S., they argue the treaty must impose global measures and targets rather than a system of national action plans. The chair of the Ottawa negotiations told Reuters he planned to split national delegates into seven working groups this week to work on unresolved issues, including what the treaty should include and how it should be implemented. During the last treaty talks in November, there was strong support from 130 governments for requiring companies to disclose how much plastic they produce, and which chemicals they use in the process. It is unclear whether the majority of countries asking for production limits can persuade the holdouts to support such a measure. Environmental groups and scientists say production limits are essential. 5% of climate emissions\n\nThe production of plastics accounts for some 5% of climate emissions and could grow to 20% by 2050 unless limited, according to a report last week from the U.S. federal Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \"More plastic production means more plastic pollution,\" said Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator of the International Pollutants Elimination Network. That point was underscored in a letter published on Tuesday by 30 scientists comprising the Scientists Coalition, who have told negotiators that caps on plastic production are the only way to tackle the problem and called on industry to provide detailed figures for production and disclose the chemicals they use to enable more efficient recycling of components. Talking Points\n\n* Marine wildlife experts were frantically trying to rescue some 140 pilot whales stranded on Thursday in the shallow waters of an estuary in the southwest of the state of Western Australia.\n\nIn Conversation C\u00e9dric Dever, director of the Plastic Waste Coalition at The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), shares his thoughts on the ongoing plastic treaty negotiations: \"The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-4) talks in Canada represent a critical point in the global negotiations to secure a binding UN Treaty on tackling plastic pollution. \"With the end-of-year deadline for an agreement imminent, now more than ever we need to act urgently to change our collective relationship with plastic. \"Collaboration and shared commitments are essential to tackling the global plastics epidemic. \"Along with many of our members, The Consumer Goods Forum is part of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty - the negotiating group providing the corporate perspective on what the new regulations should look like. \"Crucially, businesses want a robust global treaty with legally binding rules and measures to drive change on a worldwide scale through harmonized regulations on reduction, circulation, and prevention alongside remediation. \"We cannot risk an agreement which results in a patchwork of country-by-country regulations - creating inefficiencies and confusion on approach. \"Our Plastic Waste Coalition has already laid important groundwork which can help to inform the treaty's approach to packaging design, via our Golden Design Rules, and to Extended Producer Responsibility , via our Optimal EPR Guidelines.\"\n\nESG Spotlight\n\nToday's spotlight highlights the successful ethical returns of stolen artifacts going back to their original homeland, sparking a renewed interest in environmental protection.\n\nJoyful singing and cheers echoed around the hills surrounding a small village in western Democratic Republic of Congo as a procession emerged from an underground cave bearing an antique wooden figure of a Belgian colonial officer. The \"Balot\" sculpture was made in the area in the 1930s when Congo was under Belgium's brutal colonial rule. It is back in Lusanga for a six-month display after spending more than 50 years at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Its return results from years of activism by the Congolese Plantation Workers Art League (CATPC), a collective of Lusanga-based artists who use the proceeds from their art, including sales of digital images of the Balot statue, to fund reforestation projects around Lusanga. \"Everywhere you look there used to be huge forests, and when the white man came, they cut down all the wood to use it,\" said artist and CATPC member Alphonse Bukumba. \"We wouldn't live like this unless we had seen the world burn.\" Its homecoming coincides with growing global pressure on Western institutions to repatriate artifacts taken during the colonial era. Speaking of artifacts taken during the colonial era, four spears taken from Australia by a British explorer more than 250 years ago will be returned by Cambridge University to descendants of the indigenous community that crafted them.\n\nThe four spears are all that remain of the 40 or so that James Cook and his team took from the Gweagal people on their arrival in Australia in 1770, when they became the first known Europeans to reach the country's east coast. Indigenous people from across the globe have battled for years to recover works pillaged by explorers and colonists, and they are finally receiving some of the treasures back at a time when Western institutions are grappling with the cultural legacies of empire. Benin Bronzes have been returned to Nigeria by Germany and British organizations, while the Netherlands has handed back precious stones, silver and gold jewelry to its former Asian colonies, Sri Lanka and Bali.

This is the fourth of five meetings of the United Nations Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for Plastics (INC4) after 175 nations agreed in 2022 to make the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution by the end of 2024. The \"extremely short timeline for negotiations\" is meant to match \"the urgency of the problem\".\n\nThe \"hoped-for treaty\" aims to limit plastic production by 2040, said Reuters. If agreed, it could be \"the most significant deal\" on climate-warming emissions since the 2015 Paris Agreement, when nations agreed to keep global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5\u00b0C. This is a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\", said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nPlastic production is an extraordinarily greenhouse gas-intensive process. The industry currently accounts for 5% of all global carbon emissions, according to a report published last week by the US federal Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nBut the industry is on an \"exponential growth trajectory\", said The Guardian. The report's \"stunning\" estimates suggest that by 2050, the industry could account for 20% of the world's carbon footprint.\n\nThe findings make it clear that plastic production is a \"wrecking ball for our climate\", said Neil Tangri, science and policy director at the environmental justice group Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (who reviewed the report).\n\nThe report provides the \"strongest evidence to date on the need to stop and reverse the expansion of plastic production\", he told the paper.\n\nAt December's COP28 climate talks, negotiators agreed that the world should transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels. But as pressure to do so has increased, oil and gas companies \"have been looking more to the plastics side of their business as a lifeboat\", said AP News.\n\nParticipating nations must decide whether the treaty should focus on health (both human and the environment), limiting plastic production, restricting chemical use - or \"any combination of the above\", said AP News.\n\nRather than being \"anti-plastic\", the treaty should \"eliminate unnecessary single-use and short-lived plastic products\", said Andersen. \"Everybody wants this treaty,\" she added. \"There is a global demand for this, for a solution.\"\n\nBut during the three previous rounds of talks in Uruguay, Paris and Nairobi, countries became \"divided\" on the scope of the treaty, said Reuters. Participants are under pressure to find \"common ground\" before the final round in December in Busan, South Korea. And negotiators in Ottawa have a \"tough task\".\n\nOne challenge is how to \"define where the plastics lifecycle starts\", said chair of negotiations, Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Carri\u00f3n, as well as defining \"sustainable production and consumption\".\n\nBut the greatest challenge is resistance from major oil- and gas-producing and exporting countries. They \"do not want a treaty that limits their ability to extract and export fossil fuels to make plastic\", Bj\u00f6rn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network, told AP News.\n\nKnown as the Like-Minded Countries, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China have all opposed plastic production limits. Their resistance could limit the scope of the agreement to focus more on plastic waste and greater recycling.\n\nBut, Beeler told AP News, \"Production is at the centre of everything, it's the reason why this is moving slow. And it's going to get supercharged. It's not about oceans. It's more about oil.\"", "source": {"uri": "theweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Week"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score":

The Montreal Protocol of 1989 proved powerful in phasing out ozone-depleting chemicals because it set out mandatory timetables and legally binding reductions, Dr Jorge Emmanuel wrote.\n\nBy contrast, agreements that rely on voluntary commitments or carbon offset schemes -- up to 94% of which are worthless, according to scientific studies -- are less likely to generate results. \"We need to have binding global reduction targets under mandatory timetables without free riders, and those targets must be consistent with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C,\" Emmanuel warned.\n\nSources: Reuters, Nature\n\nWhile oil giants such as Shell and ExxonMobil have expressed support for the treaty, Reuters reported that behind the scenes, petrochemical lobbyists and trade groups have attempted to sway discussions away from production caps that might limit their output.\n\n\"Plastic makers want UN delegates to focus instead on waste collection, recycling and nascent waste-to-fuel technologies, areas that don't impact their businesses,\" the report stated. However, many advanced plastics projects fail to become commercially viable and the processes involved can generate toxic waste that ends up in waterways.\n\nThe role of oil lobbyists in influencing the Ottawa talks has troubled scientists, with one professor of environmental toxicology arguing in Nature that policymakers should move to insulate scientific bodies from corporate interference.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nThe European Commission has passed sweeping packaging and plastics regulations in the past four years, specifically targeting single-use plastics and reducing waste volumes. These domestic regulations could see the bloc lead by example and \"add weight and leadership to international negotiations,\" one plastics policy analyst told Bloomberg. The scale of Europe's new rules could also positively influence corporate policies: \"If some big companies are starting to change the way they produce their packaging for the EU market, they may also do the same for other markets,\" the coordinator of Break Free from Plastic Europe, an environmental group, said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

To find out more about what that journey has looked like up to now, plus what we can expect from the event, we spoke with Erin Simon, Vice President and Head of Plastic Waste and Business at WWF - who is in attendance.\n\nI think it would be useful to set the scene - what has the INC/UN Plastic Treaty process looked like up until this point? What has been determined and where are we currently at?\n\nIn March of 2022, UN Member States unanimously agreed to negotiate a treaty by the end of 2024. Since then, global leaders have gathered at three INC meetings to hammer out the details of what will become the final draft of the treaty later in 2024.\n\nThe first two meetings were largely procedural but ahead of INC3 in Nairobi, a 'zero draft' of the treaty was produced. This version was negotiated last November, and on Tuesday, the 4 session of negotiations will kick off in Ottawa. While this process can be challenging, it holds the key to shaping a future free of plastic pollution.\n\nAnd how would you reflect on the progress that has been made during this process thus far? Are there any specific positive or negative aspects that you'd like to pick out?\n\nI am still hopeful - because while this process will never be fast enough for what the planet needs, to deliver a global agreement within three years - if we can do it - will be an impressive feat.\n\nSince the negotiations started, there have certainly been a number of challenges, from countries slowing down the negotiations, to a lack of intersessional work between INC3 and INC4 - but what remains promising is the vast majority of countries agreeing, we can't let this opportunity slip by.\n\nLet's look ahead to INC-4 now - what's going to be happening at the summit, and what are some of the key things you'll be looking out for?\n\nINC-4 is a pivotal moment in the treaty's development -- it's going to be our last best chance to get this done. Countries need to seize this opportunity.\n\nI'll be watching where the discussions go around key provisions of the text, including the phasing out of problematic plastics and tackling chemicals of concern. I'll also be closely tracking discussions around mechanisms of implementation - because this treaty is only going to be successful if it can be implemented in all countries.\n\nWhat do you think the likely outcomes of INC-4 will be, and how does that compare with your hopes/ideal scenarios?\n\nAt the end of INC-4, if we walk away with agreed text on key control measures and obligations, including bans, product design and financing, a mandate for the Chair to produce a new, updated zero draft before INC5, and an agreement by all countries for formal intersessional work to take place between INC-4 and INC-5, then we will be in a place where the negotiators are setting us up for success in November.\n\nOnce the process has been fully completed, what do you think the eventual Treaty will look like?\n\nWWF has been clear on what a good treaty looks like - it must include global bans on the most harmful and avoidable high risk plastic products, it must include global product design requirements that ensure the remaining products can be easily and safely reused and recycled and there must be a strong financial mechanism in place to support a just transition. This is the treaty people and the planet need. I'm hopeful we can get there.\n\nIf you could send a message to the key stakeholders/decisionmakers - what would it be?\n\nDon't delay. There's a lot of momentum and support for taking action to solve our plastic pollution crisis. Rather than focus on our differences, let's build bridges, agree on the key measures, and deliver a treaty that can help us make change at a speed and scale that matters.", "source": {"uri": "packagingeurope.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Packaging Europe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leonhard_kurz@packagingeurope.com", "name": "Leonhard Kurz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Simon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erin Simon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member states of the United Nations"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Wide Fund for Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Just transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d2wrwj382xgrci.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1120xAny/4/5/7/14457_ottawa_473868.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507001", "eventUri": "eng-9507001", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Members will also determine the inter-sessional work required between INC-4 and INC-5 to further develop the text.\n\nINC-4 marks the second-to-last stage of negotiations, following earlier rounds in Punta del Este (INC-1, November 2022), Paris (INC-2, June 2023), and Nairobi (INC-3, November 2023).\n\nExecutive Director of the UN Environment Programme, Inger Andersen, notes that countries are moving towards consensus on phasing out problematic and avoidable plastic uses.\n\nShe emphasises that while plastic will still be needed for specific purposes like renewable energy technologies, efforts to reduce its harmful impacts are crucial.\n\n\"But there is growing agreement that short-lived and single use can go. We can be proud of what we have achieved. But a job half-done is a job not done,\" said Inger said.\n\nInger highlights that the world is racing against time, both in terms of completing the instrument and the planet's capacity to endure further damage.\n\n\"As we deliberate, plastic pollution continues to gush into ecosystems. So, I ask for INC-4 to show energy, commitment, collaboration, and ambition to make progress and set the stage for INC-5 to finalise an instrument that will end plastic pollution, once and for all,\" she said.\n\nINC-5, scheduled to take place in Busan, Republic of Korea, from November 25 to December 2, 2024, marks the conclusion of the INC process. Subsequently, a Diplomatic Conference will convene, during which Heads of State will formally sign the agreement.\n\nChair of the INC, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, emphasises the global effort to advance negotiations and finalize a treaty. He says the collective recognition that multilateral cooperation, embodied in the INC process and a new legally binding international instrument, is essential for delivering effective solutions to combat plastic pollution.\n\n\"The spirit of multilateralism is: \"together, we are stronger. Let us negotiate with accountability and integrity -grounded in the scientific evidence and facts on the scale and urgency of ending plastic pollution. Let us also approach this task with optimism, that it is both necessary and possible for us to achieve this new treaty,\" said Luis.\n\nBefore the commencement of INC-4, there were regional consultations and discussions with Observers. Canada also organized a Partnerships Day and a Ministerial Day alongside the session.\n\nCanada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Steven Guilbeault, expresses that reaching a global agreement on plastic pollution by the end of 2024 would signify one of the most impactful environmental decisions.\n\nHe highlights that such an agreement, the first of its kind, would unite the world in pursuit of a common goal to eradicate plastic pollution. Mr Guilbeault stated that Canada has implemented several measures domestically to address the issue of plastic pollution.\n\n\"We are keen to keep up the momentum for a global agreement that aligns with our ambition.

The session aims to advance negotiations so that the Committee can finalise, at its fifth session (INC-5) in November, the text of the instrument.\n\nMembers will also decide on inter-sessional work -- informal INC sessions taking place between the official meetings -- required between the INC-4 and INC-5, to support the further development of the text.\n\nINC-4, which began on Tuesday, is the penultimate stage of the negotiations; it follows three earlier rounds of negotiations: INC-1, which took place in Punta del Este, in November 2022; INC-2, which was held in Paris in June 2023; and INC-3, which happened in Nairobi in November 2023.\n\n\"We are seeing convergence on eliminating the uses that are problematic and avoidable. We will continue to need plastic for specific uses, such as renewable energy technologies. But there is growing agreement that short-lived and single-use can go,\" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme.\n\n\"We can be proud of what we have achieved. But a job half-done is a job not done. Time is against us -- both in terms of finalising the instrument and how much more the planet can take. As we deliberate, plastic pollution continues to gush into ecosystems,\" she added.\n\n\"So, I ask for INC-4 to show energy, commitment, collaboration, and ambition. To make progress. And set the stage for INC-5 to finalise an instrument that will end plastic pollution, once and for all.\"\n\nINC-5, to be held in Busan, Korea, from November 25 to December 2, is intended as the end of the INC process. It will be followed by a Diplomatic Conference where heads of state will sign the agreement.\n\n\"We are here seeking to advance these negotiations and deliver a treaty because collectively we have recognised that multilateral cooperation -- this INC process, a new legally binding international instrument -- has a critical role to play in providing the effective and impactful solutions needed to end plastic pollution. The spirit of multilateralism is: 'together, we are stronger',\" said Luis Vayas Valdivieso, Chair of the INC.\n\n\"Let us negotiate with accountability and integrity -- grounded in the scientific evidence and facts on the scale and urgency of ending plastic pollution. Let us also approach this task with optimism, that it is both necessary and possible for us to achieve this new treaty,\" he added.\n\nThe start of INC-4 was preceded by regional consultations and a conversation with observers, and Canada hosted a Partnerships Day and a Ministerial Day on the sidelines of the session.\n\n\"Agreeing to a global agreement on plastic pollution by the end of 2024 would mark one of the most significant environmental decisions and would be a first-of-its-kind agreement to unite the world around a shared goal to end plastic pollution,\" said Steven Guilbeault, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change.\n\n\"Canada has put in place several measures to stem the tide of plastic pollution at home, and we are keen to keep up the momentum for a global agreement that aligns with our ambition. We welcome delegations, partners, and stakeholders from around the world to Ottawa for INC-4 to continue the ambitious work needed to achieve this united goal.\"\n\nAt the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly in February 2024, Canada convened the other host countries of the INC process -- France, Kenya, Korea, and Uruguay -- for a ministerial meeting, under the umbrella of the Host Country Alliance, to galvanise momentum toward the global instrument.\n\n\"Seize this opportunity, make these seven days count, and deliver a text that is as close as possible to the final agreement that we all want to see,\" said Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, Executive Secretary of the INC.\n\n\"You delegates know the issues that need to be addressed at this session, and that flexibility will be needed to reach a consensus.

The first session of the INC (INC-1) took place in Punta del Este, Uruguay from 28 November to 2 December 2022, followed by a second session (INC-2) from 29 May to 2 June 2023 in Paris, France, and a third session (INC-3) from 13 to 19 November 2023 in Nairobi, Kenya.

And they have the reach in every single country on the planet, said co-author Tony Walker, a professor in Dalhousie's school for resource and environmental studies.\n\nThe peer-reviewed analysis used data gathered by volunteers at more than 1,500 events at beaches, parks, rivers and other public spaces. The audits were organized by the environmental group Break Free from Plastic and took place between 2018 and 2022.\n\nThe study also notes that the production of plastic doubled, from 200 million tonnes in 2000 to 400 million tonnes in 2019.\n\nIn a statement, Coca-Cola said its goal is to make 100 per cent of its packaging recyclable globally by 2025 and to use at least 50 per cent recycled material in its packaging by 2030. The company also said it aims to collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030.\n\nPepsiCo issued a statement on Wednesday saying it has made significant investments for more than a decade aiming to reduce the packaging we use, scale reusable models and partner to further develop collection and recycling systems.\n\nThe company added it is advocating for an ambitious and binding global policy framework to help address plastic pollution and we urge others to seize the opportunity to do the same.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Nestl\u00e9 acknowledged plastic pollution is a serious issue and one that we are working hard to help address -- and that it supports global legally binding regulation. It also cited Nestl\u00e9's ongoing projects to develop waste collection, sorting and recycling schemes in Europe, Africa, Asia, North America and Latin America.\n\nDanone did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nWATCH | Why it's so hard to end plastic pollution:\n\nThousands of delegates are in Ottawa trying to hammer out an historic treaty to end plastic pollution, but the road to get there is littered with hurdles. CBC's Susan Ormiston examines why it's so hard to curb the problem and what it will take for the world to agree on a plan.\n\nThe study comes as representatives from 176 countries gather in Ottawa for a summit on how to reduce plastic waste.\n\nIt is the fourth negotiating round ahead of a final session later this year in South Korea, where parties hope to sign onto a binding international treaty on plastic pollution.\n\nAs talks began Tuesday, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said the consensus has to be a commitment to ending the disposable consumer culture that results in so much waste.\n\nActivists staged a mass die-in in front of Ottawa's convention centre to protest what they described as the devastating impacts of plastic pollution on human health and biodiversity.\n\nPatricia Corcoran, a professor of Earth sciences at the University of Western Ontario, said the study is highly significant given its global reach.\n\nIf you highlight who the biggest producers are... then maybe that will raise awareness to the company, and the company might do something about it.\n\nPlastic waste is often painted as a consumer problem that can be solved with improved recycling, Walker said.\n\nBut as he pointed out, only nine per cent of all plastics are recycled. The rest end up in landfills or the wider environment.\n\nRecycling alone isn't going to solve this problem, he said.\n\nEliminating these hard-to-recycle plastics is another solution, as is holding these corporations accountable to pay or to design better products that don't make their way into the environment.\n\nThe study found that more than 50 per cent of the recovered plastic items had no discernible branding after being exposed to the sun, water and air.\n\nThe researchers said their study highlights the need for greater transparency about the production and labelling of plastic products and packaging, to make it easier to track pollution and hold companies accountable.\n\nThey argue for an international, open-access database into which companies are obliged to quantitatively track and report their products, packaging and brands to the environment.\n\nEarlier this week, the federal government took a step toward that goal.\n\nGuilbeault announced a new registry that would require companies to provide details on how much plastic is being produced, and where it ends up.\n\nWATCH | Guilbeault explains new plastics registry:\n\nMinister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault tells Power & Politics about plans for Canada's new plastics registry, plus details of the UN plastic pollution treaty talks in Ottawa.

But of the pollution that remains branded, more than half can be traced to 56 companies, and more than 10% to just one, according to a new study. A team of researchers led by scientists at Canada's Dalhousie University worked with data gathered by 100,000 volunteers who collected 1.8 million pieces of plastic waste from locations in 84 countries across six continents between 2018 and 2022, per the Washington Post. They linked 11% of the items to the Coca-Cola Company, 5% to PepsiCo, 3% to Nestle, and 2% to Danone, per the CBC.\n\nIn a statement, Coca-Cola says it aims to make all of its packaging recyclable by 2025 and \"to collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030,\" when packaging will include at least 50% recycled material. PepsiCo says it has worked to \"reduce the packaging we use, scale reusable models, and partner to further develop collection and recycling systems\" and is advocating for a \"global policy framework to help address plastic pollution.\" Nestle says it's \"working hard to help address\" plastic pollution by reducing its use of new plastic while incorporating more recycled materials into packaging. More than 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year.\n\nBut just 9% of plastic is recycled, so \"recycling alone isn't going to solve this problem,\" Tony Walker, an expert in resource and environmental management at Dalhousie University and co-author of the study published Wednesday in Science Advances, tells the CBC. \"Eliminating these hard-to-recycle plastics is another solution, as is holding these corporations accountable to pay or to design better products that don't make their way into the environment.\" \"Production really is pollution,\" adds study co-author Lisa Erdle, director of science at the 5 Gyres Institute, per the Guardian, noting that as the share of plastic production rises, the world's share of plastic pollution saw the same percentage increase.\n\nPlastic, made from fossil fuels, are expected to account for half of the growth in oil demand by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency. However, representatives from 176 countries are currently attending negotiations in Ottawa about an international treaty on plastic pollution, which could include limits on plastic production.

The US has positioned itself as a broker between other big oil, gas, and petrochemical exporters -- including Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia -- and countries that want steep cuts to plastic production.\n\nBut critics say the US isn't being ambitious enough.\n\n\"We'd like to see clear recognition from the US that the treaty has to confront the production of plastic polymers and resins if it's to be successful,\" Carroll Muffett, the president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law, told Business Insider. \"We cannot recycle our way out of the plastics crisis.\"\n\nMuffett is among a handful of scientists and business and community advocacy groups who told BI they wanted to see a stronger position from the US. The country has a lot of sway as the world's largest exporter of oil and gas, the main ingredients in plastics. The US has also been at the forefront of a massive build-out of new plastics and petrochemical plants over the past decade. The Environmental Integrity Project, a Washington, DC-based nonprofit, identified 50 plastic plants built after 2012 and found that at least 20 more would be built or expanded over the next five years.\n\nThe trend is global. Plastic production is expected to nearly triple by 2060 unless countries reach a deal to rein it in, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. A treaty could be the most impactful climate action since the Paris agreement because the plastic industry accounts for 5% of global carbon emissions. That could grow to 20% by 2050 if current trends continue, the US Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said.\n\n\"We aim to be an honest broker in this process,\" Jose Fernandez, the US's lead negotiator and undersecretary for economic growth, energy, and the environment at the State Department, said Wednesday in his opening remarks in Ottawa. \"That starts with being honest about our own limitations -- which include federal authorities, complex and varying subnational governmental approaches, and the fact that the science is not yet there in developing sustainable alternatives to plastic materials.\"\n\nThe Biden administration wants to finish a deal this year, given that the presidential election is in November, several observers of the negotiations told BI. But it will be difficult to persuade the Senate to ratify a treaty, they said.\n\nIn Ottawa, major disagreements remain over how to tackle the more than 350 million metric tons of plastic waste produced globally each year, much of which ends up in landfills and the environment. Only 9% of plastics are recycled.\n\nHundreds of businesses and countries support cutting plastic production. This could involve phasing out \"problematic\" plastics that can't be recycled or are harmful to public health and mandating that products be made with more recycled material. Taxing plastic polymers is also being discussed, which could help finance improvements to waste infrastructure in developing countries.\n\n\"Shared financial responsibility is something we really want to see,\" Allison Lin, the global vice president of packaging sustainability at Mars Inc., said. Lin represents the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, which includes more than 200 companies. Among them are Walmart, PepsiCo, and L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nLin said the coalition supported a policy called extended producer responsibility, which slaps a fee on companies' packaging to help fund recycling and waste management and has been successful in countries such as Belgium. Plastic makers similarly should bear some of the financial burden, she said.\n\nStewart Harris, a spokesperson for the International Council of Chemical Association, agreed that plastic makers needed to make greater investments, and the group supports EPR and recycled-content mandates. But the industry is opposed to taxes because they would be difficult to implement and it would be hard to ensure money flows into programs tackling plastic pollution, he said.\n\nPlastic makers also oppose setting caps on production, as do countries including Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Harris cited an industry-commissioned report by Oxford Economics that found a cap could increase costs for consumers as well as greenhouse-gas emissions. Plastics require less energy to manufacture and transport compared with some other materials, the report found.\n\nCutting plastic production would also hit the bottom line of oil majors such as Exxon. The International Energy Agency forecast that by 2050, petrochemical products like plastic would outpace trucks, aviation, and shipping in oil demand.\n\nNeil Nathan, a project scientist at UC Santa Barbara, and his team built an artificial-intelligence model of how 11 policies could curb plastic pollution. While many can make a big dent in the problem in the near term, pollution will eventually go up again without production caps, he said.\n\nThe model has been shared with US negotiators, Nathan added. He's disappointed the US hasn't included some of the most impactful policies into its position, he said.\n\n\"If the US takes a position or is supportive of something, we typically see a snowball effect,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

And signs with the message that plastics save lives.\n\nScientists have increasingly raised the alarm over the risks that the chemicals used in plastic pose to human health and the environment. Ahead of the latest round of talks, European researchers published a database of more than 16,000 chemicals plastics can contain, many of which have been linked to cancer risks and damage to the human immune system.\n\nThe plastics industry urgently needed to combat the image of the industry as \"the enemy, this faceless industry that is there to kill people,\" Domenic DeCaria, the Vinyl Institute's technical director, told an industry gathering ahead of the latest round of talks, according to a recording of the remarks, which DeCaria confirmed in a conversation with the Times Thursday.\n\nIn particular, the industry is pushing back against the possible inclusion in the treaty of caps on global plastic production, an approach favored by a broad coalition of nations at the talks, which resumed on Tuesday in Ottawa.\n\nSpearheading that effort are African nations that have blazed a trail in phasing out single-use plastics, which make up the bulk of plastic pollution. Almost three dozen countries on the African continent have banned various forms of single-use plastics and packaging.\n\nTargeting plastics production\n\nPlastic production has also come under heightened scrutiny because of the emissions of planet-warming gases it causes. Recycling has failed to stem the flow of plastic waste that is piling up in landfills, entering the world's rivers and oceans, and breaking down into tiny particles that have made their way into drinking water supplies and are detectable in human blood.

Small Island Developing States (SIDS), including Member States of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), are making their voices heard at these high-level meetings taking place between April 23 and 29.\n\nThe OECS has joined the call of international negotiators for an ambitious, comprehensive, and all-encompassing United Nations treaty on plastics that addresses issues related to the whole lifecycle of plastics. Dr. Joyelle Trizia Clarke, Minister with responsibility for Sustainable Development, Environment and Climate Action, and Consultancy Empowerment in St. Kitts and Nevis, said to the delegates: \"SIDS are considered the moral conscience and global voice on climate. The push for 1.5 to stay alive, the advocacy for the loss and damage fund led by Antigua and AOSIS must be brought to bear here in this conversation on plastics.\"\n\nIt has been reported by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) that between 70 to 95 percent of marine litter in the Caribbean Sea is from land-based sources, mostly plastics. This highlights the urgency of dealing with plastic pollution, especially for island nations. Furthermore, many waste and pollution issues are transboundary, which means that poor control and management in one country negatively affects neighbouring countries, potentially derailing their efforts at transitioning to blue economies.\n\nThis pollution not only destroys the marine ecosystem but also affects the economic activities of human beings depending on natural resources, which becomes a hurdle in the way of transitioning to sustainable blue economies.\n\nIn her address to meeting delegates, Dr. Clarke further outlined what SIDS aspire to in the negotiations. She stated that there should be \"increased, amplified, and visible action on banning harmful plastics, just transition pathways, which can be shared and scaled up and built out in a way that honors and edifies local ingenuity. We must also bear commitment to co-designing, co-creating our stake, and co-determining our stake in a resilient future where each life and livelihood is protected and respected.\"\n\nIn February 2022, at the resumed fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, a historic resolution (5/14) was adopted to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including pollution in the marine environment, with the ambition to complete the negotiations by the end of 2024, and a robust financial mechanism, which advances just transition and provides specific support provisions for SIDS.\n\nAs these negotiations continue at the INC-4, the OECS Commission is represented by Susanna Scott, Officer in Charge of the Sustainable Ocean Management Programme, and Farzana Yusuf-Leon, Technical Officer. The team is hoping that there will be, at the core of the mechanism, a ban on harmful plastics and a pathway for a just transition to secure a sustainable future for people and our planet.", "source": {"uri": "dominicanewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dominica News Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Eastern_Caribbean_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Island_Developing_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Small Island Developing States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Island country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_debris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine debris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Environment Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigua", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antigua"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Antigua"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antigua and Barbuda"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Kitts and Nevis"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Kitts and Nevis"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Just transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://dominicanewsonline.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DNO-Logo-Square.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507001", "eventUri": "eng-9507001", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "dateEnd": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 422, "textEnd": 437}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

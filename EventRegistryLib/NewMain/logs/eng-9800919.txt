marriage, clerical control - Shafaq News", "body": "Shafaq News/ Women's and children's rights advocates in Iraq are fiercely challenging proposals that threaten to embed sectarianism in family relationships, increase clerical control over family matters, and potentially legalize child marriages for girls as young as nine, according to a report by Middle East Eye.\n\nThe report stated that \"the amendments to Law No. 188 of the Personal Status Law of 1959 have been heavily promoted by the Coordination Framework, a coalition of conservative Shia Islamist parties that form the largest bloc in parliament.\"\n\nThe first reading took place on Sunday, following a failed attempt on 24 July that was shelved after some parties objected.\n\nIt is only the latest attempt to bring forward amendments to the law, with previous ones being shelved after political outcry.\n\nAccording to the draft bill, when concluding a marriage contract, a Muslim couple are required to choose either the Sunni or Shia sect to represent in \"all matters of personal status\".\n\n\"When a dispute occurs between the spouses regarding the doctrine according to whose provisions the marriage contract was concluded, the contract is deemed to have been concluded in accordance with the husband's doctrine unless evidence exists to the contrary,\" reads the draft, which was circulated by a number of Iraqi politicians on social media.\n\nIt would also allow figures from \"the offices of the Shiite and Sunni endowments\" to finalize marriages rather than the courts.\n\nThe draft requires Shia and Sunni endowments to submit a \"code of legal rulings\" to the parliament six months after ratifying the amendments, stipulating the Shia code would be based on \"Jaafari jurisprudence\".\n\nAlthough the question of child marriage is not directly addressed in the amendments, previous versions of the bill have been more explicit and legal experts have warned that it could be allowed based on Jaafari jurisprudence.\n\nThe report revealed that \"many Iraqi marriages are unregistered and conducted by religious figures, making them illegal under the current Iraqi Personal Status Law.\"\n\nThe proposed amendments could see those marriages -22 percent of which, according to the UN, involve girls under 14 -legitimised by the state.\n\nHowever, last week the Coordination Framework insisted the amendments would come before the parliament, saying they were constitutional and did \"not contradict the constants of Sharia and the foundations of democracy\".\n\nRa'ad al-Maliki, the MP who proposed the bill, has also hit back at claims the bill would lower the age minimum for marriage, calling them \"lies fabricated by some out of hatred for applying the provisions of God's law to those who want them\".\n\n'No to the marriage of minors'\n\nWomen's rights organisations have publicly demonstrated against the bill.\n\nOn 28 July, a group of activists - including campaigners from the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI) - gathered in Baghdad's Tahrir Square in opposition to the bill.\n\nThey held placards reading \"the era of female slaves is over\" and \"No to the marriage of minors\".\n\nYanar Mohammed, president of OWFI, told Middle East Eye that the Coordination Framework were trying to push the \"archaic\" laws as a means of distracting from their own failings, including \"huge corruption\".\n\n\"Their most efficient tool for this distraction is to terrorise Iraqi women and civil society with a legislation that strips away all the rights that Iraqi women gained in modern times, and force archaic Islamic sharia on them that regards women as bodies for pleasure and breeding, and not as human being[s] with human rights,\" she said.\n\nShe added that OWFI and others were building a \"coalition\" to try and prevent the bill from passing through the parliament and defend the current law.\n\nA number of Iraqi female lawmakers, including members from different factions, have meanwhile formed a coalition in opposition to the amendments of the Personal Status Law.\n\n\"The group wants to make it clear to everyone that the rejection is not based on emotions or external motives, but on legal, religious, professional, and social considerations and people who are concerned about protecting the order of the Iraqi family,\" Iraqi MP Noor Nafea al-Julihawi was quoted as saying by the Kurdistan24 news site.\n\n'Profoundly negative impact'\n\nThe 1959 law was passed under the government of Abdul-Karim Qasim, a leftist nationalist who brought in a number of progressive reforms, including increased rights for women.\n\n'[The proposed changes] would further entrench gender inequality and put vulnerable individuals at greater risk'\n\n- Tamara Amir, CEO, Iraqi Women's Rights Platform\n\nSince the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, however, rightwing political parties in the country have attempted to roll back these rights.\n\nPrevious versions of the bill have included rules preventing Muslim men from marrying non-Muslims, the legalisation of marital rape, and banning women from leaving the house without their husband's permission.\n\nThe latest version is considerably less explicit, but campaigners fear its passage will allow religious authorities to introduced the rules through their establishment of the Personal Status code.\n\n\"These proposed changes to the Personal Status law would have a profoundly negative impact on the rights and wellbeing of women and children in Iraq,\" said Tamara Amir, CEO of the Iraqi Women's Rights Platform.\n\nShe told MEE that unlike previous attempts at passing the reforms, she believed that the current government - led by Coordination Framework member Mohammed Shia al-Sudani - would manage to get it passed, despite Iraqi society being \"divided\" on the issue.\n\n\"They would further entrench gender inequality and put vulnerable individuals at greater risk,\"

If a dispute arises regarding the doctrine under which the marriage contract was concluded, it defaults to the husband's doctrine unless proven otherwise.\n\nThis draft, circulated by several Iraqi politicians on social media, also permits figures from \"the offices of the Shiite and Sunni endowments\" to finalise marriages, bypassing the courts.\n\nThe bill mandates Shia and Sunni endowments to submit a \"code of legal rulings\" to the parliament six months after ratification, with the Shia code based on \"Jaafari jurisprudence.\"\n\nAlthough the amendments do not directly address child marriage, legal experts warn that it could be permitted under Jaafari jurisprudence, as previous versions of the bill have been more explicit about this issue.\n\nCurrently, many Iraqi marriages are unregistered and conducted by religious figures, making them illegal under the existing Iraqi Personal Status Law.\n\nThe proposed amendments could legitimise these marriages, 22 percent of which involve girls under 14, according to the UN.\n\nOne of the most controversial effects of the amended law would be the legalisation of \"pleasure marriage,\" a concept unique to the Shiite sect.\n\nA pleasure marriage, known in Arabic as nikah mut'ah, is a temporary marriage that can last as little as an hour. Unlike a permanent marriage, a pleasure marriage does not require registration in court or the presence of witnesses.\n\nCritics say that the legalization of pleasure marriage would be devastating to the status of Shiite women and could be used to legitimate child marriage and prostitution.\n\nThe Coordination Framework insists the amendments are constitutional and do \"not contradict the constants of Sharia and the foundations of democracy.\"\n\nRa'ad al-Maliki, the MP who proposed the bill, refutes claims that it would lower the minimum marriage age, calling them \"lies fabricated by some out of hatred for applying the provisions of God's law to those who want them.\"\n\nWomen's rights organizations have publicly demonstrated against the bill. On July 28th, activists, including campaigners from the Organisation of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), gathered in Baghdad's Tahrir Square, holding placards that read \"the era of female slaves is over\" and \"No to the marriage of minors.\"\n\nYanar Mohammed, president of OWFI, told Middle East Eye that the Coordination Framework is using these \"archaic\" laws as a distraction from their failures, including \"huge corruption.\"\n\nShe argued that this legislation aims to strip Iraqi women of their modern rights and impose archaic Islamic sharia, which views women as mere bodies for pleasure and breeding, not as human beings with rights.\n\nOWFI and other organisations are building a coalition to prevent the bill from passing and defend the current law. Several Iraqi female lawmakers, from various factions, have also formed a coalition opposing the amendments.\n\nIraqi MP Noor Nafea al-Julihawi emphasised that their rejection is based on legal, religious, professional, and social considerations, not emotions or external motives, aiming to protect the Iraqi family's order.\n\nThe 1959 law, passed under leftist nationalist Abdul-Karim Qasim, brought progressive reforms, including increased rights for women.\n\nHowever, since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, rightwing political parties have tried to roll back these rights.\n\nPrevious versions of the bill have included rules preventing Muslim men from marrying non-Muslims, legalising marital rape, and banning women from leaving the house without their husband's permission.\n\nThe latest version is less explicit, but campaigners fear it will allow religious authorities to introduce such rules through their establishment of the Personal Status code.\n\nTamara Amir, CEO of the Iraqi Women's Rights Platform, warned that these changes would negatively impact the rights and well-being of women and children in Iraq.\n\nShe urged policymakers to reject these proposals and focus on strengthening protections for women and children.", "source": {"uri": "eutoday.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "eutoday.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eutoday_correspondents@eutoday.net", "name":

Reuters\n\nShia Islamist parties are pushing an amendment to Iraq's personal law in Parliament that would allow children as young as nine to be married off.\n\nThe proposed amendment, which had its first reading on Sunday, has caused outrage from women and child's rights activists.\n\nBut what do we know about it? And where else is child marriage allowed?\n\nFirst, let's take a brief look at the law that Islamists are proposing changing.\n\nAccording to Middle East Eye, amendments to Law 188 of the Personal Status Law of 1959 are being considered.\n\nThe law was passed by the Abdul-Karim Qasim government.\n\nQasim was a leftist nationalist who introduced a slew of progressive reforms including women's rights.\n\nAs per The National News, the law is thought to be the most comprehensive in West Asia when it comes to protecting the rights of women.\n\nPassed by specialists, lawyers, all religious heads, and experts in 1959, it is considered \"one of the best laws in the Middle East,\" according to women's rights activist Suhalia Al Assam.\n\nIt sets 18 as the legal age for marriage for both men and women. It also sets curbs on men being allowed to take a second wife. The law lets a Muslim man marry a non-Muslim woman without any pre-conditions.\n\nHowever, it allows men and women to be married at age 15 with the permission of a judge and their legal guardian, as per Rudaw.net.\n\nA woman is also allowed to defy her husband if he does not provide a home for her or take care of her if she is sick, as per The National News.\n\nAs per Middle East Eye, the changes to the law are being pushed by the Coordination Framework - an alliance of conservative Shia Islamist parties which comprise the biggest bloc in Iraq's Parliament.\n\nThe draft bill\n\nThe draft bill states that a couple are required to choose between the Sunni or Shia sect \"all matters of personal status.\"\n\n\"When a dispute occurs between the spouses regarding the doctrine according to whose provisions the marriage contract was concluded, the contract is deemed to have been concluded in accordance with the husband's doctrine unless evidence exists to the contrary,\" the draft bill states.\n\nThe change would let \"the offices of the Shiite and Sunni endowments\" to sanctify marriages instead of the courts.\n\nThe draft bill requires Shia and Sunni endowments to submit a \"code of legal rulings\" to Iraq's Parliament six months after ratifying the amendments.\n\nIt states that the Shia code would be grounded on \"Jaafari jurisprudence.\"\n\nJafaari law, named after the sixth Shiite Imam Ja'afar Al Sadiq, governs marriage, divorce, inheritance and adoption.\n\nIt allows girls as young as nine and boys as young as fifteen to be married.\n\nThe draft bill was introduced by Independent MP Raed al-Maliki, as per Rudaw.net.\n\nRaed previously proposed amendments to the anti-prostitution law which criminalised homosexuality and sex-reassignment surgeries.\n\nPrevious versions of the draft bill have proposed barring Muslim men from marrying non-Muslim women, legalising marital rape, and stopping women from leaving the home without permission from their husbands.\n\nThe proposed changes have raised the hackles of activists.\n\n\"These proposed changes to the Personal Status law would have a profoundly negative impact on the rights and wellbeing of women and children in Iraq,\" Tamara Amir, CEO of the Iraqi Women's Rights Platform told Middle East Eye.\n\n\"Would politicians let their nine-year-old daughter get married? I'm sure not but they would allow the oppressed Iraqi population to do so,\" Al Assam told The National.\n\n\"The Iraqi community categorically rejects these proposals, it is a degrading step for both Iraqi men and women alike. This is what we have been fighting against for years,\" she added.\n\nYanar Mohammed, president of Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), told Middle East Eye the coalition was attempting to draw attention away from their own shortcomings including \"massive corruption.\"\n\n\"Their most efficient tool for this distraction is to terrorise Iraqi women and civil society with a legislation that strips away all the rights that Iraqi women gained in modern times, and force archaic Islamic sharia on them that regards women as bodies for pleasure and breeding, and not as human being[s] with human rights,\" she said.\n\nIraqi women lawmakers putting their own coalition together in opposition to the amendment.\n\n\"The group wants to make it clear to everyone that the rejection is not based on emotions or external motives, but on legal, religious, professional, and social considerations and people who are concerned about protecting the order of the Iraqi family,\" Iraqi MP Noor Nafea al-Julihawi was quoted as saying by the news site Kurdistan24.\n\nThe Coordination Framework insists the law does not \"contradict foundations of democracy,\" as per Rudaw.net.\n\n\"The intended amendment to the Personal Status Law is in harmony with the constitution, which stipulates that Iraqis are free to make their choices in a manner that does not contradict the constants of Sharia and the foundations of democracy,\" the Shiite bloc said in a statement\n\nWhere else is child marriage allowed?\n\nAround 117 nations including the United States allow children to marry, according to a 2016 US Pew Research Center analysis.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Population Fund, child marriage remains a major problem.\n\nIt says that globally, one in five girls is either married or in an informal union before the age of 18.\n\nThe problem is particularly dire in the least developed countries where 36 per cent of girls are married before age 18, and 10 per cent of girls are married before age 15.\n\nAccording to Statista, while the issue is widespread it African countries are particularly afflicted.\n\nNiger has the highest rate of child marriage among girls. Over 75 per cent of girls under 18 are married, with around 30 percent of them being younger than 15 years.\n\nNiger is trailed by the Central African Republic, Chad, and Mali. In all these countries, the legal age to get married is lower for girls than boys.\n\nIn Niger and Chad the legal age is 15 years for girls and 18 for boys. In Guinea, the legal age is 17 for girls and 18 for boys.\n\nThe UNFPA in 2019 in a joint study with the Johns Hopkins University, Victoria University, the University of Washington and Avenir Health said child marriage in 68 countries - which account for 90 per cent of these marriages - could be ended for around $35 billion or $600 per child bride by 2030.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

The first reading took place on Sunday, following a failed attempt on July 24 that was shelved after some parties objected to the proposal, according to Middle East Eye.\n\nThe legislation is being seen as a disastrous rollback of women's and children's rights in the Iraqi society that is already marked by patriarchal norms. Once a beacon of progressive reforms, Iraq has already seen these rights being washed away after the 2003 US-led invasion.\n\nThe amendments to Law No. 188, the Personal Status Law of 1959, stipulated that couples must choose between the Sunni or Shia sect for resolving \"all matters of personal status\". It would also allow figures from the \"offices of the Shiite and Sunni endowments to finalise marriages rather than the courts\".\n\nIt further said the Shia code would be based on 'Jaafari jurisprudence', named after the sixth Shiite Imam Ja'afar Al Sadiq, which governs marriage, divorce, inheritance and adoption. It will allow girls as young as nine and boys aged fifteen to be married. The draft requires Shia and Sunni endowments to submit a \"code of legal rulings\" to Iraq's parliament six months after ratifying the amendments.\n\nEarlier versions of the draft bill included provisions to prohibit Muslim men from marrying non-Muslim women, legalize marital rape, and restrict women from leaving their homes without their husband's permission. These latest proposed changes to the bill have sparked concerns that it will allow religious authorities to introduce the rules through their establishment of the Personal Status code and erode the rights of women and children.\n\nThe landmark 1959 law was passed under Abdul-Karim Qasim, a leftist nationalist who brought in a number of progressive reforms in Iraq. Ra'ad al-Maliki, the independent MP who proposed the latest amendments, has a history of passing contentious bills that have proposed measures like criminalising homosexuality and sex-reassignment surgeries.\n\nSeveral demonstrations have been held against the highly controversial draft bill, particularly by women's organisations. Campaigners have argued that the bill could allow sectarianism in family relationships, give more power to clerics in family matters and legitimise child marriage.\n\n\"These proposed changes to the Personal Status law would have a profoundly negative impact on the rights and wellbeing of women and children in Iraq,\" said Tamara Amir, CEO of the Iraqi Women's Rights Platform. \"They would further entrench gender inequality and put vulnerable individuals at greater risk,\" she said.\n\nInas Jabbar, a board member of the Iraqi Women Network, told Rudaw that the amendments \"violates human rights, especially women's rights and it supports excluding women and girls from receiving inheritance and other rights.\" Notably, child marriage is a major issue in Iraq, with 28 per cent of girls married before the age of 18 in Iraq, according to UNICEF. Most of these marriages are legally invalid and conducted by religious leaders.\n\nIraqi women lawmakers are putting their own coalition together in opposition to the amendment. \"The group wants to make it clear to everyone that the rejection is not based on emotions or external motives, but on legal, religious, professional, and social considerations and people who are concerned about protecting the order of the Iraqi family,\" said Iraqi MP Noor Nafea al-Julihawi.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Children's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East Eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marital rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Karim_Qasim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abd al-Karim Qasim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Allies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Allies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/08/marriage-1723200589.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 620, "textEnd": 627}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

AFP\n\nRights advocates are alarmed by a bill introduced to Iraq's parliament that, they fear, would roll back women's rights and increase underage marriage in the deeply patriarchal society.\n\nThe bill would allow citizens to choose either religious authorities or the civil judiciary to decide on family affairs. Critics fear this will lead to a slashing of rights in matters of inheritance, divorce and child custody.\n\nIn particular, they are worried it would effectively scrap the minimum age for Muslim girls to marry, which is set in the 1959 Personal Status Law at 18 -- charges lawmakers supporting the changes have denied.\n\nAccording to the United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, 28 percent of girls in Iraq are already married before the age of 18.\n\n\"Passing this law would show a country moving backwards, not forwards,\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher Sarah Sanbar said.\n\nAmal Kabashi, from the Iraq Women's Network advocacy group, said the amendment \"provides huge leeway for male dominance over family issues\" in an already conservative society.\n\nActivists have demonstrated against the proposed changes and were planning to protest again later Thursday in Baghdad.\n\nThe 1959 legislation passed shortly after the fall of the Iraqi monarchy and transferred the right to decide on family affairs from religious authorities to the state and its judiciary.\n\nThis looks set to be weakened under the amendment, backed by conservative Shia Muslim deputies, that would allow the enforcement of religious rules, particularly Shia and Sunni Muslim.\n\nThere is no mention of other religions or sects which belong to Iraq's diverse population.\n\nIn late July, parliament withdrew the proposed changes when many lawmakers objected to them. They resurfaced in an August 4 session after receiving the support of powerful Shia blocs which dominate the chamber.\n\nIt is still unclear if this bid to change the law will succeed where several earlier attempts have failed.\n\n\"We have fought them before and we will continue to do so,\" Kabashi said.\n\nAmnesty International's Iraq researcher Razaw Salihy said the proposed changes should be \"stopped in their tracks\".\n\n\"No matter how it is dressed up, in passing these amendments, Iraq would be closing a ring of fire around women and children,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the proposed changes, \"Muslims of age\" who want to marry must choose whether the 1959 Personal Status Law or Sharia Islamic rules apply to them on family matters.\n\nThey also allow already-married couples to convert from the civil law to religious regulations.\n\nConstitutional expert Zaid al-Ali said the 1959 law \"borrowed the most progressive rules of each different sect, causing a huge source of irritation for Islamic authorities\".\n\nSeveral attempts to abrogate the law and revert to traditional Islamic rules have been made since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nThis time, lawmakers are maintaining the 1959 law by giving people a chance to choose it over religious authorities.\n\n\"They are giving men the option to shop in their own favour,\" Ali said. The bill would hand them \"more power over women and more opportunities to maintain wealth, control over children, and so on.\"\n\nBy giving people a choice, \"I think basically they're trying to increase the chances of the law being adopted,\" Ali said.\n\nThe new bill gives Shia and Sunni institutions six months to present to parliament for approval a set of rules based on each sect.\n\nBy giving power over marriage to religious authorities, the amendment would \"undermine the principle of equality under Iraqi law,\" Sanbar of HRW said.\n\nIt also \"could legalise the marriage of girls as young as nine years old, stealing the futures and well-being of countless girls.\"\n\n\"Girls belong on the playground and in school, not in a wedding dress,\" she said.\n\nHRW warned earlier this year that religious leaders in Iraq conduct thousands of unregistered marriages each year, including child marriages, in violation of the current law.\n\nMany argue that historically Islam has allowed the marriage of pubescent girls from the age of nine, as the Prophet Mohammed is said to have married one of his wives Aisha at that age.\n\nBut rights group say child marriages violate human rights, deprive girls of education and employment, and exposes them to violence.\n\nLawmaker Raed al-Maliki, who brought the amendment forward and earlier this year successfully backed an anti-LGBTQ bill in parliament, denied that the new revisions allow the marriage of minors.\n\n\"Objections to the law come from a malicious agenda that seeks to deny a significant portion of the Iraqi population\" the right to have \"their personal status determined by their beliefs,\" he said in a television interview.\n\nBut Amnesty's Salihy said that enshrining religious freedom in law with \"vague and undefined language\" could \"strip women and girls of rights and safety.\"", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"Controversy Erupts Over Controversial Iraqi Legislation Seeking To Reduce Legal Age Of Marriage For Girls To 9", "body": "Bookmark stories for easy access on any device or the Swarajya app.\n\nA proposed bill in Iraq's Parliament has caused a huge public outcry, as it seeks to lower the legal marriage age for girls to just 9 years.\n\nThe Iraq Justice Ministry has introduced the controversial proposal, which seeks to amend the existing Personal Status Law, under which the minimum marriage age is currently set at 18.\n\nThe proposed legislation would allow citizens to opt between religious authorities and the civil judiciary when handling family matters.\n\nCritics argue that this choice could severely diminish rights related to inheritance, divorce, and child custody.\n\nShould the bill pass, it would enable girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to marry, raising alarms over potential increases in child marriage and exploitation.\n\nOpponents of the bill contend that this regressive move threatens to erode years of advancement in women's rights and gender equality.\n\nAccording to the United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, 28 percent of girls in Iraq are already married before the age of 18.\n\n\"Passing this law would show a country moving backward, not forwards,\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher Sarah Sanbar said.\n\nAmal Kabashi of the Iraq Women's Network also voiced strong opposition, stating that the amendment \"provides huge leeway for male dominance over family issues\" in an already conservative society.\n\nThe proposed changes were initially withdrawn by the Iraqi parliament in late July following significant opposition from lawmakers.\n\nHowever, they were reintroduced in a 4 August session, backed by influential Shia blocs that hold sway in the chamber.\n\nThese proposed amendments represent a significant departure from the 1959 law, which, following the fall of the Iraqi monarchy, shifted family law authority from religious leaders to the state judiciary.\n\nThe new bill seeks to reintroduce the application of religious rules, mainly from Shia and Sunni Islam, while omitting mention of other religious or sectarian groups within Iraq's diverse population.\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that it intends to standardize Islamic law and shield young girls from \"immoral relationships.\"\n\nCritics, however, contend that this justification is flawed and overlooks the harsh realities associated with child marriage.\n\nHRW's Sanbar noted that by empowering religious authorities over marriage, the amendment would \"undermine the principle of equality under Iraqi law.\"\n\nIt also \"could legalise the marriage of girls as young as nine years old, stealing the futures and well-being of countless girls,\" she said, NDTV reported.\n\nHowever, it is still unclear if this bid to change the law will succeed as previous efforts to do so have failed.\n\nAlso Read: Sheikh Hasina's Son Says She Will

The contentious legislation, introduced by the Iraq Justice Ministry, has raised alarms among human rights advocates and critics who view it as a significant setback for women's rights in a society already entrenched in patriarchal norms. The bill would allow citizens to choose between religious authorities or the civil judiciary to decide on family affairs\n\nThe bill seeks to amend Iraq's Personal Status Law, which currently sets the minimum marriage age at 18. If passed, the legislation would require Shia and Sunni endowments to provide a 'code of legal rulings' to the Iraqi Parliament within six months. This move would shift the authority to sanctify marriages from the courts to the offices of the Shiite and Sunni endowments.\n\nThe Shia code, as per the draft, would be based on \"Jaafari jurisprudence,\" which is derived from the teachings of the sixth Shiite Imam, Ja'afar Al Sadiq. Jaafari law permits marriage for girls as young as nine and boys as young as fifteen.\n\nCritics fear that this proposed bill could lead to a surge in child marriages and exploitation, jeopardizing decades of progress in women's rights and gender equality. The option for citizens to choose between religious authorities or civil judiciary for family-related decisions has raised concerns about potential erosion of rights related to inheritance, divorce, and child custody. The move has sparked a debate on the implications of such a drastic change in marriage laws and the impact it could have on vulnerable populations, particularly young girls.\n\nIndependent MP Raed al-Maliki, who introduced the bill, has a history of proposing controversial amendments, including those to the anti-prostitution law that criminalized homosexuality and sex-reassignment surgeries. Earlier versions of the draft bill included provisions to prohibit Muslim men from marrying non-Muslim women, legalize marital rape, and restrict women from leaving their homes without their husband's permission.\n\nUNICEF reports that 28 percent of girls in Iraq are already married before reaching 18, highlighting the severity of the issue. Sarah Sanbar, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, criticized the bill as a regressive step, stating, \"Passing this law would demonstrate a country moving backward, not forwards.\"", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriageable_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marriageable age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marital rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iraq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Khanem Rahim, head of the Asuda for Combating Violence against Women, a women's rights NGO operating in Iraqi Kurdistan, told Shafaq News that the session aimed to discuss the impact of the amendments on Kurdish families living outside the Kurdistan region, particularly in disputed areas, and the negative effects on these families if the law is amended as proposed.\n\n\"Civil political forces and human rights organizations view the proposed amendments as entrenching sectarianism and strengthening the influence of religious leaders and ruling parties.\" She said.\n\nTania Kamal, a media activist for women's rights, told Shafaq News that the Personal Status Law No. 188 of 1959 is \"a progressive law that safeguards women's rights in Iraq.\" She warned that the proposed amendments \"would violate these rights and expose women and children to increased violence and division.\"\n\nKamal criticized the lack of consultation with relevant stakeholders in drafting the amendments and emphasized that the changes \"offer more harm than benefits.\"\n\n\"The amendments come amid political and sectarian conflicts and election preparations, with some parties seeking to bolster support by promoting controversial laws.\"\n\nFurthermore, Kamal urged women and civil society organizations to intensify efforts to prevent the passage of these amendments, warning that they could exacerbate domestic violence and early marriages, negatively affecting the family and society as a whole.\n\nPotential Child Marriages and Women's Rights Violations\n\nThe proposed amendments to Iraq's PSL have ignited significant controversy. One clause permits Iraqis to choose between Shia or Sunni jurisprudence for personal status matters when entering into marriage contracts. Those who have not previously selected a specific jurisprudence can request the application of their chosen religious law from the Personal Status Court, which must comply with their request.\n\nThe amendments also stipulate the use of a Shia Jaafari jurisprudence code for personal status matters and a separate code for Sunni jurisprudence based on the predominant views of scholars from each sect in Iraq.\n\nActivist Intisar Saleh told Shafaq News that \"the amendments would lower the marriage age to nine years, deprive women of inheritance rights in real estate, and condition alimony on sexual enjoyment, stating that a wife who does not allow her husband to enjoy her would not be entitled to alimony.\"\n\nThe law is a \"mercy bullet\" to Iraqi society. She said.\n\nSaleh added that the amendments would further divide Iraq, create legal chaos, and move personal status issues outside official courts.\n\nThe goal of the amendments, according to Saleh, is to \"dismantle Iraqi families, expand the scope of extralegal contracts, and legitimize child marriages, thereby increasing divorce rates and deepening sectarian divides.\"\n\nIn turn, activist Layla Taha pointed out that Iraq's 1959 Personal Status Law is \"one of the best in the Middle East, setting the legal marriage age at 18 for both genders,\" arguing that \"Iraq has a civil culture, and any legislation contrary to this would have adverse effects.\" Taha suggested that amendments should align with social and cultural changes and meet current societal needs.\n\nThe Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights has called on the Iraqi parliament to reconsider the proposed amendments to ensure the \"protection of all Iraqi citizens' rights, regardless of their sect or beliefs, and to promote equality and justice in Iraqi society.\"\n\nThe observatory stressed the need to adhere to the Iraqi constitution and international human rights agreements to ensure the \"fair and equitable application of the Personal Status Law.\"", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0629

The controversial legislation, introduced by Iraq's Justice Ministry, aims to amend the country's Personal Status Law, which currently sets the minimum marriage age at 18.\n\nThe bill would allow citizens to choose whether religious authorities or the civil judiciary should handle family matters. Critics fear this will significantly reduce rights related to inheritance, divorce, and child custody.\n\nIf passed, the bill would permit girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to marry, raising concerns about increased child marriage and exploitation. Critics argue that this backward step would erode decades of progress in advancing women's rights and gender equality.\n\nHuman rights organizations, women's groups, and civil society activists have strongly opposed the bill, warning of severe consequences for young girls' education, health, and well-being. They point out that child marriage leads to higher dropout rates, early pregnancies, and a greater risk of domestic violence.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, 28 per cent of girls in Iraq are already married before the age of 18.\n\nSarah Sanbar, a researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), stated that passing this law would indicate a country regressing rather than progressing.\n\nAmal Kabashi of the Iraq Women's Network also expressed strong opposition, arguing that the amendment \"grants excessive control to men over family matters\" in an already conservative society.\n\nParliament withdrew the proposed changes in late July after many lawmakers raised objections. However, the bill resurfaced in an August 4 session, gaining support from powerful Shia blocs that dominate the chamber.\n\nThe proposed changes would represent a shift from the 1959 legislation that, after the fall of the Iraqi monarchy, transferred family law authority from religious figures to the state judiciary. The new bill would reintroduce the option of applying religious rules, primarily from Shia and Sunni Islam, without mentioning other religious or sectarian communities in Iraq's diverse population.\n\nSupporters of the bill claim it aims to standardize Islamic law and protect young girls from \"immoral relationships.\" However, opponents argue that this reasoning is flawed and overlooks the harsh realities of child marriage.\n\nSanbar from HRW noted that by giving marriage authority to religious figures, the amendment would \"undermine the principle of equality under Iraqi law\" and could \"legalize the marriage of girls as young as nine, robbing countless girls of their futures and well-being.\"\n\n\"Girls belong on the playground and in school, not in a wedding dress,\" she added.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether this latest attempt to change the law will succeed where previous efforts have failed.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriageable_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marriageable age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Iraq"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sharia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iraq-child-marriage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 1705, "textEnd": 1713}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The Iraqi Parliament began debating these amendments on Sunday, raising significant concerns among human rights activists and citizens alike, Breitbart reported.\n\nThe amendments would allow men to opt for traditional Shiite or Sunni Islamic mandates over the country's existing legal standards for matters like marriage consent, alimony, and child custody. Currently, Iraqi law mandates that both men and women must be at least 18-years old to marry and provides protections for widows and inter-religious marriages. The proposed changes could drastically alter these protections, potentially legalizing child marriages and giving fathers full custody rights in divorce cases unless they choose otherwise.\n\nNotably, the amendments would require Shiites to follow the Ja'afari school of Islamic law, which permits girls to marry at the age of nine and boys at the age of 15. This legal code also includes provisions for \"pleasure marriages,\" temporary arrangements that can last as little as an hour, which critics argue could be used to justify prostitution and sex slavery.\n\nLawmakers are reportedly under intense pressure from radical Shiite Islamist clerics and other influential figures to pass the law. Following the fall of Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein and the subsequent rise of Shiite influence backed by Iran, Shiite leaders have gained significant power, particularly through the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a group of militias integrated into Iraq's armed forces during the fight against ISIS.\n\nAn anonymous parliamentary source revealed to the Media Line that Shiite powers are leveraging their influence to ensure the law's passage, stating, \"They are now negotiating with us -- either we pass the law or no other law proposed by the rest of the blocs will be passed, and since they are the majority, they may pass this law, but they need more votes.\"\n\nThe proposed amendments have faced strong opposition from human rights activists and a coalition of over 15 female lawmakers determined to block the changes.\n\n\"Our rejection is not based on emotional issues, as some might claim, nor is it driven by external motives, but rather based on legal, religious, professional, and social observations, and stems from a sincere concern to protect the Iraqi family,\" the lawmakers said in a statement translated by the Emirati newspaper The National.\n\nShiite clerics like Sheikh Mohammed Khalil Al-Sanjari and Sayed Jafar al-Mousawi maintain that Islamic law considers girls mature at nine and boys at 15, thus permitting marriage at those ages.\n\nHuman Rights Watch highlighted the prevalence of child marriages in Iraq, noting that despite the current law, the government does little to enforce it.\n\n\"According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), 28 percent of girls in Iraq are married before age 18,\" and the U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq reports that \"22 percent of unregistered marriages involve girls under age 14.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mobilization_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular Mobilization Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saddam Hussein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sharia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=f5b1129d-416d-4ba3-9f59-34d3732c0c5b&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Introduced by the Iraq Justice Ministry, it was put forward as an amendment to the country's 1959 Personal Status Law, which was once considered a critical move in the advancement of women's rights in Iraq. It set the legal marriage age to 18 and also transferred the jurisdiction of family matters from religious authorities to the state.\n\nNow, supporters of the bill argue the amendment will protect young girls from immoral relationships. Whereas people in opposition emphasize it would lead to child marriage and exploitation. It is also suggested the new proposal would let families choose whether civil courts or religious authorities would handle family affairs but opposition highlights this could reduce women's rights in cases of divorce, inheritance, and child custody.\n\nIraqi Women's rights organizations have publicly demonstrated against the bill over fears of child marriage and exploitation that would undo years of progress in promoting women's rights and gender equality in the country. Previously, a group of activists gathered at the Tahrir Square in Baghdad to oppose the bill. Members from the Organisation of Women's Freedom (OWFI) in Iraq held placards that read \"The era of female slaves is over\" and \"No to the marriage of minors.\"\n\n\"Their most efficient tool for this distraction is to terrorise Iraqi women and civil society with a legislation that strips away all the rights that Iraqi women gained in modern times, and force archaic Islamic sharia on them that regards women as bodies for pleasure and breeding, and not as human being[s] with human rights,\" Yanar Mohammed, president of OWFI told Middle East Eye.\n\nAdditionally, Tamara Amir, the CEO of the Iraqi Women's Rights Platform added, \"These proposed changes to the Personal Status law would have a profoundly negative impact on the rights and wellbeing of women and children in Iraq.\"\n\nIf the bill passes, the legal age of marriage for girls would be nine, and for boys would be 15.

While child marriages, sex slavery, and other abuses are rampant in modern-day Iraq, they are not technically legal. Iraqi law currently requires both men and women to be 18 years old to enter marriage, allows a woman to inherit her husband's assets in the event of his death, and allows for unconditional inter-religious marriage.\n\nThe amendments to the secularized Personal Status Law, passed in 1959, would allow the relevant men in a marriage or proposed marriage to choose whether to apply Sunni sharia rules or Shiite sharia. It does not discuss other religions, such as Christianity, Zoroastrianism, or the Yazidi faith, which once boasted vibrant constituencies in Iraq but were almost entirely exterminated by the Islamic State (ISIS) \"caliphate\" in the past decade. Members of minority religions would most likely have to abide by the current form of the Personal Status Law.\n\nNotably, the updated law would require Shiites to use a sharia code based on the Ja'afari school of Islamic law. The Ja'afari school provides that girls can enter a legal marriage at age nine and boys at age 15. It gives full custody of children of divorced couples to the fathers, unless the man chooses to give up custody to the mother, and includes a provision for an arrangement known as a \"pleasure marriage,\" which \"is a temporary marriage that can last as little as an hour,\" according to the Middle East outlet the Media Line. Human rights activists noted that the provision has the potential to be abused to facilitate prostitution and sex slavery, as a man can claim participating in those actions was merely a \"pleasure marriage.\"\n\nLawmakers are reportedly facing significant pressure from radical Shiite Islamist clerics and other power brokers to push the law through Parliament. Shiites are a minority in Iraq but have grown increasingly influential following the fall of Sunni socialist dictator Saddam Hussein with significant backing from neighboring Iran, the world's most populous Shiite state and a premier state sponsor of terrorism. More recently, following the U.S.-backed destruction of the Islamic State \"caliphate,\" Shiite influencers gained prominence through the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a group of mostly Shiite, Iran-backed militias that were legally integrated into the Iraqi armed forces during the war with ISIS.\n\nSpeaking to the Media Line, an anonymous Iraqi \"parliamentary source\" described significant pressure on lawmakers from Shiite powers to amend the law to erode women's and children's rights.\n\n\"They are now negotiating with us -- either we pass the law or no other law proposed by the rest of the blocs will be passed, and since they are the majority, they may pass this law, but they need more votes,\" the source reportedly told the outlet.\n\nThe amendments proposed have prompted widespread outrage among human rights activists in the country. In Parliament, a coalition of over 15 women formed a coalition dedicated to defeating the amendments.\n\n\"Our rejection is not based on emotional issues, as some might claim, nor is it driven by external motives, but rather based on legal, religious, professional, and social observations, and stems from a sincere concern to protect the Iraqi family,\" the lawmakers said in a statement this week, according to a translation by Emirati newspaper The National.\n\nThe Kurdish outlet Rudaw reported that protesters are expected to take the streets on Thursday in seven provinces to pressure lawmakers to trash the amendments. Human rights activists in the country condemned the updated law. It \"violates human rights, especially women's rights and it supports excluding women and girls from receiving inheritance and other rights. Not to mention that the amendment also allows girls to be married off before the age of ten,\" one women's rights activist told Rudaw.\n\nDefenders of the amendments have insisted that Islam is the law of the land in Iraq and those who do not wish to engage in child marriages can simply not get married to a child - dismissing the core human rights objection to child marriages that no child can consent to marriage. Child marriages are not uncommon in Iraq despite the current law, Human Rights Watch revealed in a March 2024 report, but the Iraqi government does little to enforce the law.\n\n\"According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), 28 percent of girls in Iraq are married before age 18,\" Human Rights Watch observed. \"According to the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq, 22 percent of unregistered marriages involved girls under age 14.\"\n\nThe Iraqi outlet Shafaq News quoted the head of the parliament's Women, Family, and Children Committee, Dunya Al-Shammari, as saying, \"the first clause of the proposal states that the current Personal Status Law will remain in effect and unchanged. However, individuals who wish to marry according to their sectarian beliefs will have that option.\"\n\nAl-Shammari said the updated legal code would enhance \"freedom of choice.\"\n\nShafaq also quoted a Shiite cleric, Sheikh Mohammed Khalil Al-Sanjari, who dismissed child marriage concerns on Wednesday, stating, \"a girl is considered mature at nine years old thus marriage is permissible.\"\n\n\"This is a general ruling and not obligatory, but as an Islamic obligation, she is considered accountable at nine and a man at fifteen. This varies based on the region's climate,\" the cleric added.\n\nSimilarly, Shiite cleric Sayed Jafar al-Mousawi told the Media Line, \"when a woman reaches puberty and gets her period, she becomes a full woman, and she has the right to marry. And when a child reaches puberty, he has the right to marry too, so why do we refuse?\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances Martel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sharia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mobilization_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular Mobilization Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoroastrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazidis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yazidis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caliphate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudaw_Media_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudaw Media Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraqi Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Children's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saddam Hussein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/child-bride-prepares.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The draft bill introduced by Shi'ite Islamic groups. Although the bill is unlikely to pass into law, it has sparked concerns about the protection of women's and children's rights, as per Reuters.\n\nThe proposed amendment seeks to alter Iraq's Personal Status Law, which currently sets the minimum legal age for marriage at 18 for both boys and girls. The amendment's most controversial aspect is its provision allowing girls as young as nine and boys as young as 15 to marry, which critics believe would roll back decades of progress in promoting gender equality.\n\nHuman rights groups have strongly opposed the bill, fearing it could pave the way for an increase in child marriages.\n\nThe new Iraq bill would allow citizens to choose between religious authorities or the civil judiciary to make decisions on family matters. Critics argue this could weaken protections in areas such as inheritance, divorce, and child custody.\n\nALSO READ: SC Grants Bail To Manish Sisodia In CBI And ED Cases, AAP Leader To Walk Out Of Jail After 17 Months\n\nUNICEF reports that 28 per cent of girls in Iraq are already married before reaching 18. Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher Sarah Sanbar expressed concern that passing the law would be a significant step backward for the country. Amal Kabashi from the Iraq Women's Network echoed these sentiments, warning that the amendment would reinforce male dominance in an already patriarchal society.\n\nIraq's 1959 Personal Status Law is regarded as a milestone in protecting women's rights in the country. Passed shortly after the fall of the Iraqi monarchy, the law shifted family matters from religious to state jurisdiction, setting the legal marriage age at 18. The proposed amendment threatens to reverse these protections, particularly for Shiite and Sunni Muslims, by reintroducing religious rules into family law.\n\nFollowing significant opposition in late July, the bill was temporarily withdrawn but resurfaced on August 4 with support from influential Shiite blocs in parliament. While its future remains uncertain, activists like Kabashi are determined to continue opposing the amendment.\n\nAmnesty International has also voiced strong opposition, with Iraq researcher Razaw Salihy calling for the amendments to be stopped, warning that they could legalise the marriage of girls as young as nine, jeopardising their futures.\n\nALSO READ: 'If You Help Enemy': BNP Warns Of Strained Relations Over India's Support For Sheikh Hasina\n\nSupporters of the bill, including lawmaker Raed al-Maliki, argue that objections stem from a \"malicious agenda\" aiming to deny a significant portion of Iraqis the right to have their personal status determined by their beliefs.

In order for a bill to become binding it must have three readings, be debated thoroughly and then a vote will be held unanimously.\n\nIt has been mainly pushed forward by the Co-ordination Framework - a coalition of Islamist Shiite parties that form the largest bloc in parliament.\n\n\"We have seen on social media and through politicians that have spoken out of political bargaining inside the parliament in what they call 'vote for me and I will vote for you',\" she said.\n\nThe current law is considered to be the most protective of women's rights in the Middle East.\n\nIt was passed in 1959 by \"specialists, lawyers, all religious heads, and experts and this was one of the best laws in the Middle East\", Ms Al Assam said, arguing that the majority of those currently in power in Iraq lack the expertise to enact changes.\n\nThe law stipulates the legal age of marriage for both men and women is 18, and taking a second wife is extremely restricted.\n\nIt also states that a Muslim male is allowed to marry a non-Muslim female without conditions or restrictions and a woman can disobey her husband if he harms her by failing to provide adequate housing or care should she fall ill.\n\n\"Many politicians have attempted to do this in the past, but failed. This is a civil law that includes all aspects of Iraq's society regardless of religious background,\" she explained.\n\nThe proposed changes stipulates that officials from the Shiite and Sunni endowments can end marriages, instead of the courts.\n\nIt also enables Sunni and Shia endowments to have a code of legal rulings that it would govern from. The law would be based on the Ja'fari law, named after the sixth Shiite Imam Ja'afar Al Sadiq, who founded his own school of jurisprudence. It deals with issues of marriage, divorce, inheritance and adoption.\n\nThe proposed bill would allow Iraqi Shiites to follow the Ja'afari school of jurisprudence, which permits marriage for girls as young as nine and boys at fifteen.\n\nHassan Wahhab, founder and president of Iraqi Human Rights Defenders and Activists Consortium, told The National the law must be studied carefully to ensure the protection of women and children, as well as their rights.\n\n\"We are blaming the parliament for not consulting with experts and organisations to reach an acceptable, unbiased amendment that takes into account the rights of children and women,\" said Mr Wahhab, who has also worked with vulnerable and marginalised groups for the Iraqi Al Amal Association.\n\n\"This is the real problem here, also ignoring and not respecting the large number of voices that are calling for the halting of this amendment, is a big issue,\" he said.\n\n\"It would violate Iraq's international obligations, especially what is stated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child,\" he said.\n\nMore than 15 female MPs have formed a bloc to oppose the draft bill. They have held several meetings with political leaders and called on other women to join their party.\n\nThey also criticised lawmakers for not giving the full details of the proposed amendments or laying out what this could mean going forward if it passes.\n\n\"Our rejection is not based on emotional issues, as some might claim, nor is it driven by external motives, but rather based on legal, religious, professional, and social observations, and stems from a sincere concern to protect the Iraqi family,\" the women's bloc said.\n\nRuba Al Hassani, a legal Sociologist at Lancaster University, told The National that the formation of such a coalition made up of female politicians from across the political spectrum is a first in post-2003 invasion Iraq.\n\nThe coalition's goal is to defend women's and children's rights from modifications to legislation such as \"changes to child custody during legal battles, where a father would be favoured regardless of the child's age or the circumstances surrounding the legal battle. Also that a woman be denied inheritance, especially of real estate, after her husband's death\", Ms Al Hassani said.\n\nIf pushed forward, the bill would \"compromise future generations\", she said.\n\nThe proposed bill is also pushing for the amendment of the amnesty law bill by Sunni politicians, which if passed, will see the release of prisoners. They argue that thousands from their community have been unjustly imprisoned in Shiite-dominated Iraq since 2003 due to alleged links to terrorist groups.\n\nMs Al Hassani said this move is seen as a package deal between Sunni and Shia politicians who are bargaining their way towards passing both of the draft bills.\n\n\"It's a 'you scratch my back while I scratch yours' situation with the understanding that Sunnis would vote for the Amnesty Bill and that Shia MPs would vote for the Personal Status bill,\" Ms Al Hassani, who is an expert on legal Iraqi societal matters, told The National.\n\n\"By doing so, there's an attempt to further sectarianise society at a time when Iraqis are tired of years of sectarianism,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "kmaupdates.com", "dataType":

Opponents have raised concerns that the legislation could deprive women and girls of basic rights.\n\nIf approved, amendments to the bill would allow Iraqis to choose to follow religious rules to govern matters related to marriage and family. In particular, the changed legislation would grant Muslim clerics the right to finalize marriage contracts outside the court system, potentially legalizing child marriages. Human rights campaigners also argue that the bill would deepen sectarian divides in the Middle East nation.\n\nIn late July, the Iraqi parliament dropped the proposed changes after facing opposition from several lawmakers and widespread public criticism. However, the amendments were brought back in an August 4 session after getting broad support from Shiite blocs which currently dominate the chamber.\n\nThe 1959 law \"borrowed the most progressive rules of each different sect, causing a huge source of irritation for Islamic authorities,\" constitutional expert Zaid al-Ali told AFP news agency.\n\nBack in July, the issue was met with widespread public criticism, with people gathering at Tahrir Square in Baghdad to protest against the controversial bill.

Activists fear that the bill would roll back women's rights in an already patriarchal society.\n\nThe bill, according to AFP, will allow citizens to choose between religious authorities or the civil judiciary for decisions on family matters. Critics claimed that this bill could drastically reduce protections in areas such as inheritance, divorce, and child custody.\n\nPresent of marriage in Iraq is 18 years\n\nCurrently, the minimum age for marriage for both girls and boys is set 18 years under the 1959 Personal Status Law. The present law shifted family matters from religious to state jurisdiction. Passed after the fall of Iraqui monarchy, it was seen as a cornerstone of women's rights in Iraq. The new bill is supported by conservative Shiite Muslim deputies. The new bill is especially for Shiite and Sunni muslims and does not mention other religions or sects in Iraq, according to a WION report.\n\nThe bill was re-introduced on August 4\n\nAfter facing opposition in late July, the bill was temporarily withdrawn. But, it was again re-introduced on August 4 with support from powerful Shiite blocs in the Iraqi Parliament. Lawmaker Raed al-Maliki, who introduced the bill, had argued that 'the objections come from those with a malicious agenda that seeks to deny a significant portion of the Iraqi population the right to have their personal status determined by their beliefs,' reported WION.\n\nAmnesty International has opposed the bill. Iraq researcher Razaw Salihy called for the amendments. He warned that these changes to the existing law would create a 'ring of fire around women and children,' and jeopardize their futures, according to reports. Several human rights advocates have warned that such religious freedom in law could deny women and girls of their rights and safety.\n\nThe bill has also sparked protests, with activists planning to intensify the demonstrations in Baghdad to oppose the bill.

Critics are concerned that this could erode rights in areas such as inheritance, divorce, and child custody.\n\nThe 1959 law is expected to be weakened by the amendment, which has the backing of conservative Shiite Muslim lawmakers and would permit the enforcement of religious rules, specifically those of Shiite and Sunni Islam.\n\nThe proposal does not address other religions or sects within Iraq's diverse population.

Thus, sectarian division enters all households,\" said Yanar Mohammed, president of the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq, another group within Coalition 188.\n\n\"Besides, civil courts that file marriage and divorce may become obsolete, and will no longer defend women's rights to alimony, custody of children, or other rights.\"\n\nMohammed told MEE that the Coordination Framework and its allies were trying to push these \"archaic\" laws on Iraqis as a distraction from their own failures, including \"huge corruption\".\n\nTamara Amir, another Coalition 188 member, also warned that the changes would have a \"profoundly negative impact on the rights and wellbeing of women and children in Iraq\".\n\nUnlike previous attempts to pass these reforms, Amir told MEE that she believes the current government - led by Coordination Framework member Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani - will succeed in getting it passed, despite Iraqi society being \"divided\" on the issue.\n\n\"They would further entrench gender inequality and put vulnerable individuals at greater risk,\" she said.\n\n\"We urge policymakers to reject these proposals and instead focus on strengthening protections for women and children.\"", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Eye"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_macdonald@middleeasteye.net", "name": "Alex MacDonald",

Under current Iraqi law, both can marry from 18.\n\n'The Iraqi community categorically rejects these proposals, it is a degrading step for both Iraqi men and women alike. This is what we have been fighting against for years,' women's rights activist Suhalia Al Assam told The National this week.\n\nAn Iraqi woman holds a banner reading in Arabic 'amending the Personal Status Law will deepen societal division' during a protest in Baghdad on August 8, 2024\n\nProtesters hold up signs in English and Arabic calling for secular law to protect children\n\nProtesters gather to demonstrate against a proposed law to permit underage female marriage\n\nThe amendments to Law No. 188, the Personal Status Law of 1959 have been pushed by a coalition of conservative Shia Islamist parties, which form the largest bloc in parliament.\n\nThe Coordination Framework attempted to carry out a first reading on July 24, but shelved the plans until last Sunday after meeting political resistance.\n\nMany protesters gathered in Tahrir Square in the capital on Thursday to voice their opposition to the bill, which some said would foment further division in society.\n\nIraq's current law states that marriage requires 'a sound mind and completing eighteen years of age', with provisions for women fleeing abuse in annulling a contract.\n\nFifteen-year-olds can submit a marriage request, which judges can choose to approve if they deem the individual well and obtain their legal guardian's consent.\n\nA judge may permit the marriage of a fifteen-year-old 'if he finds this absolutely necessary', the law states, without providing further details.\n\nUnder the new laws, marrying Muslim couples would choose either a Sunni or Shia sect, who would be able to represent them in 'all matters of personal status' - rather than the civil judiciary.\n\n\"When a dispute occurs between the spouses regarding the doctrine according to whose provisions the marriage contract was concluded, the contract is deemed to have been concluded in accordance with the husband's doctrine unless evidence exists to the contrary,' the draft says.\n\nAnd figures from the offices of each 'endowment' would be able to finalise marriages, rather than the courts.\n\nThis may also see unregistered marriages - more than a fifth of which involve girls under 14 - legitimised by the state.\n\nThe current amendments circulating do not directly refer to the issue of child marriages - but previous drafts have, inspiring sharp and ongoing criticism from rights activists.\n\nYanar Mohammed, president of the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), told Middle East Eye the Coordination Framework was using the changes to distract from their own 'corruption' and political failures.\n\nShe said the proposals served to 'terrorise Iraqi women and civil society with a legislation that strips away all the rights that Iraqi women gained in modern times'.\n\nMs Mohammed added that the bill would 'force archaic Islamic sharia on them that regards women as bodies for pleasure and breeding, and not as human being[s] with human rights.'\n\nAn Iraqi woman holds a banner reading in Arabic 'amending the Personal Status Law will deepen societal division' in Baghdad on Thursday\n\nActivists amassed in Tahrir Square in Baghdad on Thursday to oppose the bill\n\nProtesters have repeatedly turned out in Tahrir Square as the coalition tries to push the law\n\nOn July 28, activists wielded signs reading 'the era of female slaves is over' and 'no to the marriage of minors' as they walked through Tahrir Square in Baghdad, the outlet reports.\n\nThe 1959 law was introduced nearly 30 years after the British left by a progressive, left-wing nationalist government under Abdul-Karim Qasim.\n\nSince the invasion of Iraq and fall of Saddam Hussein, right-wing groups have tried to repeal many of these laws and rights.\n\nProposals have included banning the marriage of Muslim men and non-Muslim women, and legalising marital rape.\n\nMany Iraqis, especially in built-up hubs like Baghdad, have liberal attitudes towards women's rights.", "source": {"uri":

The proposed legislation, which has been tabled in the Iraqi Parliament, is viewed by critics as a major setback for women's rights in a society already dominated by patriarchal norms.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require couples to choose between Sunni or Shia sects for resolving personal status issues, such as marriage and divorce. In cases of dispute between spouses over which doctrine governs their marriage, the bill defaults to the husband's sect unless evidence suggests otherwise. This provision has raised concerns about the potential for increased male dominance in marital disputes.\n\nBJP to unveil third edition of 'Har Ghar Tiranga' campaign ahead of 77th Independence Day\n\nOne of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the mandate for Shia and Sunni religious endowments to submit a \"code of legal rulings\" to Iraq's Parliament within six months of the bill's ratification. This would effectively shift the authority to sanctify marriages from the courts to religious offices, specifically those of the Shiite and Sunni endowments.\n\nThe proposed Shia code, based on \"Jaafari jurisprudence,\" allows marriage for girls as young as nine and boys as young as fifteen, a provision that has alarmed activists.\n\nIndependent MP Raed al-Maliki, who introduced the bill, has a history of proposing controversial amendments, including those criminalizing homosexuality and restricting women's rights. Earlier drafts of the bill included provisions that would legalize marital rape and prohibit Muslim men from marrying non-Muslim women, further fueling concerns.\n\nHuman rights groups are particularly alarmed by the potential impact on child marriages. According to UNICEF, 28% of girls in Iraq are married before the age of 18, and this bill could exacerbate the issue by eliminating existing age restrictions. Despite assurances from some lawmakers that the bill would not lower the marriage age, critics remain deeply skeptical.\n\nSarah Sanbar, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, warned that passing the bill would be a significant step backward for the country. Amal Kabashi of the Iraq Women's Network echoed these concerns, noting that the bill would provide \"huge leeway for male dominance over family issues\" in an already patriarchal society.\n\nDonald Trump assassination bid: New bodycam footage captures tense moment police spotted shooter (WATCH)\n\nThe 1959 Personal Status Law, which set the marriage age at 18 and transferred family jurisdiction from religious authorities to the state, is widely regarded as a cornerstone of women's rights in Iraq. The new bill, however, threatens to unravel these protections by reintroducing religious laws, particularly for Shiite and Sunni Muslims, while neglecting the rights of Iraq's diverse religious communities.\n\nAlthough the bill was initially withdrawn in late July due to significant opposition, it resurfaced on August 4 with strong support from powerful Shiite blocs in parliament. Rights groups, including Amnesty International, have voiced strong opposition to the bill. Razaw Salihy, an Amnesty International researcher in Iraq, urged for the bill to be \"stopped in its tracks,\" warning that it could create a \"ring of fire around women and children,\" potentially legalising the marriage of girls as young as nine.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriageable_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marriageable age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marital rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waqf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ratification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Movement", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amal Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static-gi.asianetnews.com/images/01j4tp97479pnvpd86wnxmb62v/minors.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 3082, "textEnd": 3090}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

This has caused a lot of concern among human rights groups and women's organistions.\n\nCurrently, the law in Iraq says that people must be at least 18 to get married. However, the new law, proposed by the Iraq justice ministry, would let people choose whether to follow religious rules or the civil court system for family matters.\n\nCritics are worried that this change could reduce women's rights in areas like inheritance, divorce, and child custody.If the law passes, it would allow girls as young as nine and boys as young as 15 to get married. This has raised fears that there will be more child marriages and exploitation of young girls.\n\nHuman rights groups and activists are strongly against the bill. They warn that it could have serious negative effects on young girls' education, health, and overall well-being.\n\nThey point out that child marriage often leads to girls dropping out of school, getting pregnant at a young age, and being at a higher risk of domestic violence. According to Unicef, 28 per cent of girls in Iraq are already married before they turn 18.\n\nA researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that passing this law would be a step backwards for the country. Amal Kabashi from the Iraq Women's Network also opposed the bill, saying that it would give men more control over family issues in a society that is already very conservative.\n\nThe new law would reverse changes made in 1959, which took family law decisions away from religious leaders and gave that power to the state courts. The proposed law would allow people to follow religious rules, mostly from Shia and Sunni Islam, but it doesn't mention other religious groups in Iraq.\n\nSupporters of the bill say it would make Islamic law more consistent and protect young girls from inappropriate relationships. However, opponents argue that this reasoning overlooks the dangers of child marriage. They believe that letting religious leaders decide on marriage could harm the principle of equality under Iraqi law and would allow girls as young as nine to be married, taking away their futures and well-being.\n\n\"Girls should be playing and going to school, not getting married,\" said a researcher, highlighting the importance of protecting the rights and futures of young girls in Iraq.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The legislation, introduced by the Iraq Justice Ministry, aims to amend the country's Personal Status Law, which currently sets the minimum age for marriage at 18.\n\nThe bill would allow citizens to choose whether religious authorities or the civil judiciary should decide on family matters, a provision critics argue could significantly reduce women's rights in inheritance, divorce, and child custody. The proposed changes would enable girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to marry, raising fears of an increase in child marriage and exploitation.\n\nOpponents of the bill, including human rights organizations, women's groups, and civil society activists, warn that the legislation would roll back years of progress in gender equality and women's rights.

The proposed amendments are feared to enhance the power of religious authorities over civil courts, potentially legalizing female child marriages and curtailing fundamental women's rights.\n\nDemonstrations orchestrated by a coalition of women's rights organizations and NGOs occurred in key cities like Basra, Babylon, DhiQar, Kirkuk, Najaf, and Diwaniya.\n\nAmal Kabashi, a notable women's rights advocate from Baghdad, expressed her alarm to The New Arab, citing that \"The proposed amendments compromise the principle of equality guaranteed under Article 14 of Iraq's constitution, paving the way for a judicial system plagued by proportionalism and sectarianism, jeopardizing both societal and familial unity.\"\n\nKabashi also pointed out that the amendments could remove protections for women regarding forced divorce compensation, custody rights, and other personal status matters currently safeguarded under existing legislation.\n\nFurther exacerbating concerns, the ruling Shia Coordination Framework has promoted amendments that would allow Shia and Sunni clerics to finalize marriage contracts outside of traditional court systems, raising serious legal and ethical questions, particularly regarding the permissible age for girls to marry.\n\nKabashi highlighted the dire implications, saying, \"Should these amendments pass, they would not only allow but potentially normalize child marriages, even as young as nine years old. Moreover, they could legally sanction various forms of marriage currently unrecognized by Iraqi law, such as pleasure and misyar marriages.\"\n\nSrood Mohammed Faleh, director of the Iraqi Al-Amal Association's Kirkuk branch, echoed these sentiments, labeling the amendments as retrogressive. In a statement to TNA, Faleh lamented, \"The law that has been in place for 70 years has better-protected women's rights than these proposed changes, which represent a regression for our advancing society.\"\n\nActivists like Faleh are pushing back hard against a second reading of the bill, arguing it violates the core principles of Iraq's constitution. They warn of numerous adverse outcomes, including an increase in child marriages and a significant erosion of constitutional rights for women, children, and even men. The amendments, they argue, would severely undermine the authority of civilian courts in handling marriage, divorce, custody, and housing matters.\n\nCurrent trends in Baghdad and other regions, like the prevalence of pleasure marriages disguised as temporary unions orchestrated by religious clerics, highlight the urgent need for legislative scrutiny. Such temporary or pleasure marriages, known as Sigheh, are widespread in Iran. Critics are concerned that the proposed bill could legalize these transient marriages, further endangering women's rights and potentially increasing the risk of sexually transmitted diseases,

Sanbar reportedly said that this bill, if passed, will show the country moving backwards.\n\nHowever, the lawmakers have reportedly rejected the claims made against the bill.\n\nThe proposed amendment is mainly to allow Iraqis to choose either religious authorities or civil judiciary in settlement of family affairs including marriage, inheritance, divorce and child custody.\n\nThe Personal Status Law was passed by Abdul-Karim Qasim, the military leader who ascended to the throne after overthrowing the monarchy in 1958. According to The National News, this law is the most comprehensive and the best when it comes to protecting the rights of women. However, men and women could get married at age 15 with consent from their legal guardian and a judge.\n\nALSO SEE: 'I Mean Ukraine!': George W.

This shift could significantly impact family law, allowing sectarian interpretations to override civil protections currently in place. Critics also fear this change could lead to the legalization of child marriage and deepen sectarian divisions within Iraq.\n\nIn response to the bill's advancement, widespread protests have erupted across the country.\n\nOn July 28, demonstrators from the Organisation for Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI) gathered in Tahrir Square, Baghdad, to protest the proposed changes. Activists, including OWFI president Yanar Mohammed, held signs reading \"No to underage marriage\" and \"The era of female slavery is over.\" Mohammed condemned the Coordination Framework, which pushed the bill, accusing them of using \"archaic\" laws to distract from their failings, such as corruption.\n\nIraqi MP Aso Feridun has been a vocal critic of the bill, warning that \"Children married at this age cannot possibly understand the implications of marriage.\" She added that nearly 100 MPs are opposing the bill and are actively working to prevent its passage, though their efforts have yet to succeed.\n\nHuman Rights Watch researcher Sarah Sanbar also criticized the bill, stating, \"Passing this law would show a country moving backward, not forwards.\" Sanbar voiced concerns

The bill would allow citizens to choose either religious authorities or the civil judiciary to decide on family affairs. Critics fear this will lead to a slashing of rights in matters of inheritance, divorce and child custody.\n\nIn particular, they are worried it would effectively scrap the minimum age for Muslim girls to marry, which is set in the 1959 Personal Status Law at 18 -- charges lawmakers supporting the changes have denied. According to the United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, 28 percent of girls in Iraq are already married before the age of 18. \"Passing this law would show a country moving backwards, not forwards,\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher Sarah Sanbar said.\n\nAmal Kabashi, from the Iraq Women's Network advocacy group, said the amendment \"provides huge leeway for male dominance over family issues\" in an already conservative society. Activists have demonstrated against the proposed changes and were planning to protest again later Thursday in Baghdad.\n\nThe 1959 legislation passed shortly after the fall of the Iraqi monarchy and transferred the right to decide on family affairs from religious authorities to the state and its judiciary. This looks set to be weakened under the amendment, backed by conservative Shiite Muslim deputies, that would allow the enforcement of religious rules, particularly among Shiite and Sunni Muslims.\n\nThere is no mention of other religions or sects which belong to Iraq's diverse population. In late July, parliament withdrew the proposed changes when many lawmakers objected to them. They resurfaced in an August 4 session after receiving the support of powerful Shiite blocs which dominate the chamber.\n\n'Option to shop'\n\nIt is still unclear if this bid to change the law will succeed where several earlier attempts have failed. \"We have fought them before and we will continue to do so,\" Kabashi said. Amnesty International's Iraq researcher Razaw Salihy said the proposed changes should be \"stopped in their tracks\". \"No matter how it is dressed up, in passing these amendments, Iraq would be closing a ring of fire around women and children,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the proposed changes, \"Muslims of age\" who want to marry must choose whether the 1959 Personal Status Law or Sharia Islamic rules apply to them on family matters. They also allow already-married couples to convert from the civil law to religious regulations. Constitutional expert Zaid Al-Ali said the 1959 law \"borrowed the most progressive rules of each different sect, causing a huge source of irritation for Islamic authorities\".\n\nSeveral attempts to abrogate the law and revert to traditional Islamic rules have been made since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. This time, lawmakers are maintaining the 1959 law by giving people a chance to choose it over religious authorities. \"They are giving men the option to shop in their own favor,\" Ali said. The bill would hand them \"more power over women and more opportunities to maintain wealth, control over children, and so on.\" By giving people a choice, \"I think basically they're trying to increase the chances of the law being adopted,\" Ali said.\n\n'Malicious agenda'\n\nThe new bill gives Shiite and Sunni institutions six months to present to parliament for approval a set of rules based on each sect. By giving power over marriage to religious authorities, the amendment would \"undermine the principle of equality under Iraqi law,\" Sanbar of HRW said.

The controversial legislation, introduced by the Iraq Justice Ministry, aims to amend the country's Personal Status Law, which currently sets the minimum age for marriage at 18.\n\nThe bill would allow citizens to choose between religious authorities or the civil judiciary to decide on family affairs. Critics fear this will lead to a slashing of rights in matters of inheritance, divorce, and child custody.\n\nIf passed, the bill would allow girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to wed, sparking fears of increased child marriage and exploitation. Critics argue that this regressive move would undermine decades of progress in promoting women's rights and gender equality.\n\nHuman rights organizations, women's groups, and civil society activists have vehemently opposed the bill, warning of serious consequences for young girls' education, health, and well-being. They argue that child marriage leads to increased dropout rates, early pregnancies, and a heightened risk of domestic violence.\n\nAccording to the United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, 28 percent of girls in Iraq are already married before the age of 18.\n\n\"Passing this law would show a country moving backward, not forwards,\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher Sarah Sanbar said.\n\nAmal Kabashi of the Iraq Women's Network also voiced strong opposition, stating that the amendment \"provides huge leeway for male dominance over family issues\" in an already conservative society.\n\nIn late July, parliament withdrew the proposed changes when many lawmakers objected. They resurfaced in an August 4 session after receiving the support of powerful Shia blocs that dominate the chamber.\n\nThe proposed changes would mark a shift from the 1959 legislation. This law, enacted after the fall of the Iraqi monarchy, transferred family law authority from religious figures to the state judiciary. The new bill would reintroduce the option to apply religious rules, primarily from Shia and Sunni Islam, but does not mention other religious or sectarian communities within Iraq's diverse population.\n\nProponents of the bill claim it aims to standardize Islamic law and protect young girls from \"immoral relationships.\" However, opponents counter that this reasoning is flawed and ignores the harsh realities of child marriage.\n\nBy giving power over marriage to religious authorities, the amendment would \"undermine the principle of equality under Iraqi law,\" Sanbar of HRW said.\n\nIt also \"could legalise the marriage of girls as young as nine years old, stealing the futures and well-being of countless girls.\"\n\n\"Girls belong on the playground and in school, not in a wedding dress,\" she said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nIt is still unclear if this bid to change the law will succeed where several earlier attempts have failed.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhimanyu_kulkarni@ndtv.com", "name": "Abhimanyu Kulkarni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriageable_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marriageable age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child custody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Iraq"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/of068ka8_iraq-women-protest_625x300_09_August_24.jpeg?ver-20240615.100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 1720, "textEnd": 1728}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The bill aims to lower the legal age for girls to marry from 18 to just 9 years old. Introduced by the Iraq Justice Ministry, it seeks to amend the country's Personal Status Law. Currently, the law sets the minimum marriage age at 18.\n\nThe proposed bill would allow girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to marry. Critics worry this could lead to more child marriages and exploitation, undermining progress made in women's rights and gender equality. They argue that such a law would negatively impact young girls' education, health, and overall well-being. Child marriages often result in higher dropout rates, early pregnancies, and increased domestic violence.\n\nThe United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, reports that 28 percent of girls in Iraq are already married before turning 18. Human Rights Watch researcher Sarah Sanbar said, \"Passing this law would show a country moving backward, not forwards.\"\n\nAmal Kabashi from the Iraq Women's Network also criticized the bill, saying it \"provides huge leeway for male dominance over family issues\" in a society that is already conservative. The proposed changes would mark a shift from the 1959 legislation, which moved family law authority from religious figures to the state judiciary. This new bill would reintroduce the option to follow religious rules from Shia and Sunni Islam but does not address other religious or sectarian groups in Iraq.\n\nSupporters of the bill argue it aims to standardize Islamic law and protect young girls from \"immoral relationships.\" However, opponents believe this reasoning is flawed and does not consider the negative effects of child marriage. Sarah Sanbar of HRW said, \"It could legalize the marriage of girls as young as nine years old, stealing the futures and well-being of countless girls.\" She added, \"Girls belong on the playground and in school, not in a wedding dress.\"\n\nIt remains uncertain if this attempt to change the law will succeed where previous efforts have failed.", "source": {"uri": "gg2.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "GG2"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriageable_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marriageable age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Movement", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amal Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Female education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sharia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.gg2.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iraqi-women-protestors-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 460899205, "relevance": 2}

The group includes some Iraqi MPs.\n\n\"My husband and my family oppose child marriage. But imagine if my daughter gets married and my daughter's husband wants to marry off my granddaughter as a child. The new law would allow him to do so. I would not be allowed to object. This law legalises child rape.\"\n\nDuring protests organised by the coalition this week in the capital, Baghdad, and in several other cities in Iraq, supporters of the new law confronted opponents and accused them of \"moral decadence\" and \"following western agendas\".\n\nAlthough Iraq has outlawed marriage under the age of 18 since the 1950s, one survey by the UN children's agency, Unicef, found that 28% of girls in Iraq had married before they reached the age of 18.\n\nSince 2021, the Iraqi political system has been dominated by the Coordination Framework, a political coalition of Iran-aligned factions. They have passed several sharia-oriented laws, including one to adopt religious holidays and another criminalising gay and transgender people in Iraq.\n\n\"Following the mass youth protests which took place in Iraq in 2019, these political players saw that the role of women had begun to strengthen in society,\" said Nadia Mahmood, co-founder of the Iraq-based Aman Women's Alliance. \"They felt that feminist, gender and women's organisations, plus civil society and activist movements, posed a threat to their power and status ... [and] began to restrict and suppress them.\"\n\nA bloc of 25 female MPs in parliament have been trying to stop the draft law being put to a second vote, but said they face strong opposition.\n\n\"Unfortunately, male MPs who support this law speak in a masculine way, asking what's wrong with marrying a minor? Their thinking is narrow minded. They don't take into consideration that they are the legislators that determine people's fate ... but rather follow their masculine thinking to authorise all this,\" said Alia Nassif, an Iraqi MP.\n\nProtesters said they feared their children would face a future even harsher than their own if the law changes were adopted. \"I have one daughter, I don't want her to be forced like me to marry as a child,\" said Azhar Jassim, who had to leave school to be married aged 16.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Representatives_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Representatives of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Azhar_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al-Azhar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feminism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masculinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a319b243054a2d6764947fef4c5fa7bcdc09a04/0_56_4380_2628/master/4380.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=62fd827887d59b26221ffbdde6254dff", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800919", "eventUri": "eng-9800919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 460914565, "relevance": 2}

Iraq's hardliners have been trying to push this through for years but this time it might just become law. The legal age for a girl to marry in the Islamic nation is currently 18, according to the Economic Times, although some claim it is 15.\n\nThe move smacks of Sharia law and was proposed by the Iraq Justice Ministry. It would amend the Personal Status Law, negating the minimum age of marriage as 18.\n\n\"The bill would allow citizens to choose between religious authorities or the civil judiciary to decide on family affairs. Critics fear this will lead to a slashing of rights in matters of inheritance, divorce, and child custody,\" NDTV World reported.\n\n\"If passed, the bill would allow girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to wed, sparking fears of increased child marriage and exploitation. Critics argue that this regressive move would undermine decades of progress in promoting women's rights and gender equality,\" the media outlet added.\n\n\"Human rights organizations, women's groups, and civil society activists have vehemently opposed the bill, warning of serious consequences for young girls' education, health, and well-being. They argue that child marriage leads to increased dropout rates, early pregnancies, and a heightened risk of domestic violence,\" NDTV World continued.\n\nThe United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, estimates that 28 percent of girls under the age of 18 are currently married off. This new law would drastically increase that number.\n\n\"Passing this law would show a country moving backward, not forwards,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Sarah Sanbar remarked to NDTV World.\n\nShe's not the only one making that assertion either. Amal Kabashi of the Iraq Women's Network is saying the same thing and strongly opposes the move. She claims that the amendment \"provides huge leeway for male dominance over family issues\" in a society that is already suppressed culturally.\n\nThere was harsh pushback from many lawmakers in Iraq's government when the proposed changes were initially introduced, so in late July, parliament withdrew them. But they resurfaced in an August 4 session and received heavy support from the powerful Shia blocs that dominate the chamber.\n\n\"The proposed changes would mark a shift from the 1959 legislation. This law, enacted after the fall of the Iraqi monarchy, transferred family law authority from religious figures to the state judiciary. The new bill would reintroduce the option to apply religious rules, primarily from Shia and Sunni Islam, but does not mention other religious or sectarian communities within Iraq's diverse population,\" NDTV World wrote.\n\n\"Proponents of the bill claim it aims to standardize Islamic law and protect young girls from 'immoral relationships.' However, opponents counter that this reasoning is flawed and ignores the harsh realities of child marriage,\" the outlet continued not stating that what is prized most by men in Iraq is a virgin bride, so the sooner they marry, the greater the chance the girl will still be one.\n\nSanbar contended that the amendment would \"undermine the principle of equality under Iraqi law,\" and \"could legalize the marriage of girls as young as nine years old, stealing the futures and well-being of countless girls.\"\n\n\"Girls belong on the playground and in school, not in a wedding dress,\" she argued.\n\nIt is unknown if the amendment will pass but given the strength of the Shia blocs, it's a pretty good bet that it will.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

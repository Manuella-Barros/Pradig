A number of dogs, including Nuggi, were removed from the property and taken to an Auckland Council animal shelter.\n\nAnimal control officers noted that in the 10 metres that Nuggi had to walk from the property to the car, he had to stop three times to catch his breath. They also said his legs appeared to be collapsing under the weight of his huge body.\n\nLater that day, Nuggi was taken to SPCA's M\u0101ngere Centre where he was assessed by a veterinarian. He weighed 53.7kg and was so obese that it wasn't possible to hear his heart with a stethoscope because the sound couldn't penetrate the fat. His nails were overgrown, and he had lots of skin tags, particularly on areas of contact such as his belly and elbows. Nuggi also had conjunctivitis.\n\nSPCA Chief Executive Todd Westwood says Nuggi's condition was a huge shock to SPCA Inspectors and staff, who're used to dealing with animals at the opposite end of the weight scale.\n\n\"Nuggi was easily one of the most obese animals we've ever encountered.

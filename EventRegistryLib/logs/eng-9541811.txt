This is according to an insider who spoke to the Daily Express.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales were spotted last June visiting the grounds of the school, sparking rumours about where Prince George would study, much like his father and uncle, Harry. Last year, a source suggested that Kate was worried about the day her son would have to leave home for boarding school, which has been accepted as part of Royal duty.\n\nThe source revealed: \"Kate long disagreed with her husband about sending him away, even though it's tradition. Kate thinks sending him to such a stuffy, upper-crust institution goes against all of their efforts to modernise the monarchy,\" reports Aberdeen Live.\n\nREAD MORE: Heroic dad wins \u00a39K compensation from easyJet holidays after pool rescue turns bloody\n\nREAD MORE: Major incident update after Bristol Royal Infirmary fires\n\nThe source added: \"She'll miss George desperately. She and William argued about it for years, but he has finally won.\"\n\nThe Prince himself began studying at the renowned Berkshire school in 1995, where he stayed throughout the term, often spending weekends with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, at Windsor Castle next door. An insider has revealed that Kate Middleton has agreed to send Prince George to the exclusive \u00a315,432-a-term school, stating that the Princess \"finally gave in\" after recognising her son's desire to follow in his father's footsteps.\n\nSpeaking to In Touch Weekly, the source added: \"But she's still heartbroken. She was horribly bullied at her first boarding school, and can't bear the thought of George suffering through that.\"\n\nWhile Kate may be saddened by the prospect of her eldest son leaving home, there are a few years left to enjoy his company before he heads off to Eton, as students typically start there at age 13. To gain admission to Eton, candidates must undertake a 150-minute verbal and mental reasoning test, with a score of 125 or above usually considered competitive.\n\nAfter moving to Adelaide Cottage in Windsor in 2022, the Royal couple transferred all their children to the nearby Lambrook school. Highlighting its convenience, the same source noted that George could visit his family every weekend, just like Prince William used to do with his grandparents when he was an Eton student, given it's only a nine-minute drive from the family cottage.\n\nDespite this, like any mother, Kate is understandably anxious about missing her young son. The source encapsulated the sentiment, stating, \"But it still seems as if her family is being torn apart. There's also the worry that William will insist the other two kids be shipped off next. Kate knows this is all part of her 'royal duty'.\"\n\nWant the latest Bristol breaking news and top stories first? Click here to join our WhatsApp group.

The prince continues to attend public-facing royal engagements, though Kate has been away from the royal spotlight since Christmas. The Princess of Wales revealed in a video in March 2024 that she had been diagnosed with cancer, but she came forward only after the press and public berated her for being absent for so long.\n\nDespite Kate's serious diagnosis, William continues to say the princess is \"doing well\" amid her chemotherapy treatment.\n\nA big part of William's royal duties is interacting with the public. Many people stand and wait to greet the prince whenever he attends a public engagement. Recently, Kate has been top of mind for most Brits, and any time William greets fans, her name is always mentioned; William even dropped everything to retrieve flowers for his wife from two women in the crowd at a recent event.\n\nDuring an event on April 30, William was greeting fans when someone asked about Kate -- and he provided a brief but encouraging update. \"Do you mind if I ask how your wife and children are?\" one woman in the crowd asked, according to Fox News. William's reply was short but sweet: \"We're all doing well, thank you.\"\n\nWhen the woman asked specifically about \"Catherine,\" William repeated himself, saying, \"We're all doing well.\" It was a brief exchange, but William's decision to acknowledge and answer questions about Kate's progress is encouraging on its own. William has been attending public engagements but also balancing time with his wife and three young children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis.\n\nRight now, there is no timeline for Kate's return. Kensington Palace has said that they will provide updates as needed but only if there is a reason. And so far, there has not been an update since Kate made her announcement back in March.\n\nKate has not revealed what type of cancer she has, what stage it is, or an official treatment plan. She only said that she was undergoing \"preventative chemotherapy\" and that she requested privacy so she and William could keep life as normal for their young children as possible. Although William has remained in the spotlight, neither Kate nor the kids have been seen since Christmas. The whole family opted out of Easter church services back in late March, and the next time they might be seen is Trooping the Colour in June, which is one event where William and Kate always allow their children to make an appearance. Still, there has been no word on whether Kate or any of the children will attend this year's celebration.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_mullaney@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Julia Mullaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(1796\u20131817)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796\u20131817)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooping_the_Colour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trooping the Colour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kate-Middleton-health.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541811", "eventUri": "eng-9541811", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 942, "textEnd": 950}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

However, the most obvious change for the royals is Kate having to step back from public duties following an abdominal surgery and her cancer diagnosis.\n\nPrincess Kate withdrew from the public eye in December 2023, and it was revealed in January that the royal had undergone an abdominal procedure, although further details at the time weren't shared.\n\nDespite the explanation of where Kate would be, speculation began to arise about her whereabouts, prompting several conspiracy theories. On 22 March, the Princess of Wales shared a video where she confirmed that post-op tests discovered cancer and that she started treatment for the condition in late February.\n\nAlthough William has continued carrying out royal duties, with the prince increasing his workload due to his father's cancer diagnosis, Kate has been recovering out of the public eye. An update has not been shared as to when Kate is expected to return to royal duties, with a statement only saying: \"The Princess will return to official duties when she is cleared to do so by her medical team. She is in good spirits and is focused on making a full recovery.\"\n\nNew roles\n\nWilliam and Kate became the Prince and Princess of Wales ahead of the King's coronation, but since the historic occasion, the pair have picked up other duties, some more honorific than others.\n\nIn August, Charles redistributed some of his late mother's old roles, as well as roles that were held by Prince Andrew until he stepped back as a senior royal due to his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nKate became the Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm, Royal Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Coningsby and the Colonel-in-Chief of the Welsh Cavalry. Meanwhile, William became the Colonel-in-Chief of the Mercian Regiment, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps and the Royal Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Valley.\n\nOutside of the military roles, William has also been appointed as the Grand Master of the Order of Bath, and Kate became the Royal Companion of The Order of the Companions of Honour.\n\nPrince George's education\n\nWilliam and Kate's eldest son, Prince George, is still currently studying at Lambrook School alongside his younger siblings, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. However, in the past year, the royal parents have been looking towards George's future education.\n\nOne of the possible scenarios is for George to follow in his father's footsteps and attend Eton College with the youngster already taking exams that could see him enter the prestigious establishment. However, Eton isn't the young royal's only option and earlier in the year, William and Kate were seen touring St. Edward's Independent School, a \u00a347,000-a-year institute in Oxfordshire alongside Marlborough College in Wiltshire, which counts Kate as an alumni.\n\nBuilding houses on the Duchy of Cornwall\n\nThe Prince of Wales has been the Duke of Cornwall since the late Queen's death, a role previously held by his father. The role comes with a grand estate on Cornish land, and William has signalled his intention to build homes on the land as part of his campaign to combat homelessness.\n\nWorking alongside St Petrocs, a homelessness charity based in the county, the royal aims to create 24 homes in Nansledan, Newquay, alongside additional support for the residents. Construction is expected to begin in September 2024 and is expected to be completed a year later in 2025.\n\nIntroducing their children to royal duties\n\nAlthough they're still years away from carrying out solo engagements, since the coronation, Prince William and Kate's children have been seen more often, with Prince Louis making his debut at events like Kate's carol concert and the annual Sandringham Christmas walkabout. The young royal was also present for part of his grandfather's coronation after missing the late Queen's funeral.\n\nShortly after the coronation, the royal children were seen with their parents as part of the Big Help Out, while George has been more frequently seen at his father's side when they attend sporting fixtures, with Charlotte also seen in attendance at Wimbledon. The Wales children also helped to pack donations at a baby bank in Maidenhead with mum Kate at the end of last year.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"},

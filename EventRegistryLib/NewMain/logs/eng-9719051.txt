That alert, which was in effect from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., asked residents to limit power usage and avoid gas stations to help mitigate poor air quality.\n\nThe current guidelines from the South Coast AQMD to help minimize ozone air pollution levels include:\n\n1. Delay trips to gas stations until evening hours\n\n2. Limit the use of gasoline-powered lawn and garden equipment until evening\n\n3. Conserve electricity and set air conditioners at higher temperatures\n\n4. Postpone the use of household chemicals until evening\n\nNewsweek contacted the AQMD via email on Monday for further comment on these guidelines.\n\nThese recommendations mirror those issued in previous alerts, underscoring the ongoing nature of California's air quality problems.\n\nThe persistence of these air quality issues highlights the severity of ozone pollution, particularly during the summer months. As the NWS noted in its alert last week, \"Elevated levels of ozone -- the predominant summertime pollutant -- are likely to result in poor air quality in the afternoon and early-evening hours.\"\n\n\"Ozone air pollution can cause respiratory health problems, including trouble breathing, asthma attacks, and lung damage,\" the NWS stated in its first notice. \"Children, older adults, and people with asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may be more sensitive to the health effects of ozone.\"\n\nThe newly released map uses color coding to indicate the severity of air quality concerns in different areas. Red zones, signifying \"Unhealthy\" air quality index (AQI) levels, now encompass not only the Los Angeles basin but also extend into the Inland Empire and parts of Orange County.\n\nWhen air quality index (AQI) levels are Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (orange), people with heart or lung disease, pregnant women, children, and older adults should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. At Unhealthy (red) AQI levels, everyone may experience adverse health effects, and sensitive groups should avoid prolonged time outdoors. At Very Unhealthy (purple) AQI levels, sensitive groups should avoid all outdoor physical activity, and everyone else should avoid prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.\n\nHealth officials remain particularly concerned about vulnerable populations, including children, older adults, and individuals with respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. These groups are advised to be especially vigilant about limiting outdoor exposure during periods of poor air quality.\n\nFor the latest updates on air quality conditions and advisories, California residents are encouraged to visit the websites of their local air quality management districts or consult the relevant mobile apps.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

We often see this during the summer months.\n\nCurrently, DFW's air quality is at an orange level or \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\" This means groups with respiratory issues should limit time outdoors.\n\nThe alert is in place due to expected high levels of ozone.\n\nHigh levels of pollution, sunlight, high pressure, and light winds are all contributors to ozone production.\n\nHigh levels of pollution develop when emissions from motor vehicles and factories are released into the atmosphere. When high pressure is in place (like it often is during the summertime), sinking air traps those emissions at the surface. On days like today, light winds don't do much to scatter the aerosols, so pollution stays concentrated over the area.\n\nSunshine and heat will take the higher concentrations of pollution and cause a chemical reaction creating ozone.\n\nOzone is toxic to inhale which is why the air quality alert is in place.

Why is that?\n\nYahoo News spoke to air quality experts who explained how heat waves, which are happening more often and lasting longer recently, can lead to poor air quality -- and what that can mean for your health.\n\nMarianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, told Yahoo News in May that sunlight creates a type of air pollution, called ozone, made up of toxic gas created in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWhile a concentration of ozone is typically a summertime issue, it can be exacerbated on particularly hot days with low wind speed.\n\n\"The pollution can stay over a city,\" Kioumourtzoglou said.\n\n\"The summertime conditions, where it's hot and there's a lot of sunlight, kind of push that chemistry to go faster and make more ozone,\" Peter DeCarlo, associate professor of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University, explained to Yahoo News in May.\n\nAdditionally, drought conditions can worsen air quality by triggering wildfires. According to the University Corporation of Atmospheric Research -- a nonprofit group of colleges and universities that provide research and training in atmospheric sciences -- these fires release carbon monoxide and particle pollution into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\"Wildfires are a significant contributor to air pollution,\" Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir, a technology company that monitors air quality for the United Nations, told Yahoo News Tuesday. \"With climate change, we have more often these drought conditions than previously because of the fact that the Earth is getting warmer.\"\n\nThe U.S. has a measurement system for air quality called the air quality index (AQI). The AQI has six color-coded categories with a value system that runs from zero to 500. The higher the level of air pollution the more hazardous it is for your health. You can find the current AQI for your area by typing in your zip code at AirNow.gov.\n\n\"There are different categorizations of air quality from good to moderate to unhealthy for sensitive groups to unhealthy for pretty much everyone, and then progressively worse beyond that,\" DeCarlo said.\n\nState environmental agencies have about 4,000 monitoring stations that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The stations send hourly or daily measurements of the following air pollutants to the EPA's database, called the Air Quality System:\n\nWhen particulate matter -- defined by the EPA as \"a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air\" -- reaches unhealthy levels for the public, it triggers an air quality alert on most smartphones.\n\nExperts say that air pollution can be pretty toxic for your health. It has been linked to adverse cardiovascular, pregnancy and neurodevelopmental outcomes. When you breathe in air pollution, the particles can produce an imbalance in the body known as oxidative stress, and can cause inflammation in your lungs that triggers wheezing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest.\n\n\"Both inflammation and oxidative stress are harmful to the body,\" Kioumourtzoglou said. \"That's why air pollution has the potential to impact all our organs and all our systems.\"\n\nHammes offered suggestions for staying safe from air pollution on extremely hot summer days, including limiting outdoor activities, wearing a properly sealed N95 mask, using an air purifier and running an air conditioning unit indoors.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ozone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

The last time people really seemed to care about the air quality alerts was when the sky actually turned orange across New York resulting from the wildfires in Canada.\n\nIt's pretty hard to ignore a warning when it's that visible. But what do these air quality alerts really mean on a day-to-day basis? And how dangerous are they?\n\nAn air quality alert is based on the predicted AQI (Air Quality Index) for any given day. The AQI essentially measures levels of polluted air. Different pollutants that the DEC monitors to help determine the AQI include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, fine particles, ozone, and sulfur dioxide.\n\nOzone refers specifically to ground-level ozone, made up of human-made emissions like the emissions from cars and factories.\n\nOn Monday, July 8th, the AQI was at a 74 for the lower Hudson Valley and a 50 for the Upper Hudson Valley.\n\nThe DEC considers the lower Hudson Valley to be Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Ulster, and Sullivan. The Upper Hudson Valley is outlined as Albany, Columbia, Fulton, Greene, Montgomery, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, and Washington.\n\nA 74 put the lower Hudson Valley in the yellow zone on the AQI scale, meaning the air quality was moderately acceptable, but those sensitive to air pollutants might have extra discomfort and risk. These sensitive populations include people with known lung diseases, children, pregnant people, and the elderly.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 9th, an air quality health advisory was issued for parts of New York State including the New York City Metro area and the Lower Hudson Valley region.\n\nThe AQI for Tuesday is at 101 for the lower Hudson Valley, leaping over the Yellow Zone and putting it in the Orange Zone. The main culprit for the negative air quality is the ozone pollutant.\n\nThe Orange Zone denotes a risk for sensitive groups. The \"sensitive groups\" list also expands to, \"people with lung disease such as asthma, older adults, children and teenagers, and people who are active outdoors.\"\n\nAccording to the American Lung Association, consistent exposure to bad AQIs can have real long-term health effects.\n\nIn 2013, the World Health Organization determined that lung cancer, the #1 cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, can be caused by exposure to partial pollution. Healthy children exposed to pollutants in the air are susceptible to chest and lung infections which can even stunt lung development.\n\nFor pregnant people, too much exposure to poor air quality leads to low birth weights for infants and even contributes to infant mortality.\n\nWhile air quality alerts seem to flash on our screens without a ton of thought, it's extremely important to pay attention to these alerts whether you're part of a sensitive group or not.\n\nIf the AQI is between 0 - 100, most people are fine to carry out their typical outdoor exposure with the exception of young kids, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with known lung conditions.\n\nFor the current Orange Zone air quality conditions, AirNow recommends that if you are a young child, older adult, or pregnant person, it is advised that you limit outdoor activity. If you need to be outside, try to limit your exposure to the morning hours when ozone pollutants are lower.\n\nIf you have a lung condition like asthma, it is advised that you keep rescue inhalers and medications handy while monitoring symptoms and limiting your outdoor exposure.\n\nDuring 2023's Canadian Wildfire smoke, New York's AQI surpassed 300, putting it in the most severe zone, the Maroon Zone.\n\nIf the AQI were to ever reach this point again, all outdoor activity should be limited for all persons and those with lung conditions should basically not leave the house.\n\nBeyond the air quality, heat is also a concern around New York currently.

The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere protects the planet from the Sun's radiation, but ozone that forms at ground level -- caused by a chemical reaction in the sunlight between pollutants such as car exhaust fumes -- can be dangerous. \"Ozone in the air we breathe can harm our health, especially on hot sunny days when ozone can reach unhealthy levels,\" according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \"People at greatest risk of harm from breathing air containing ozone include people with asthma.\"\n\nThis week's alert is designed to encourage Colorado motorists to leave their vehicles at home, and instead use public transport, walk if possible and their health allows, car share, or simply consolidate several car trips into one journey to lessen the impact on the environment.\n\nThe \"Ozone Action Day Alert is now in effect for the Front Range Urban Corridor,\" according to the notice, which was published at 4:10 p.m. on Monday. \"Request to limit driving gas and diesel-powered vehicles is now in effect until at least 4 p.m. Tuesday, July 9, 2024.\"\n\nThe areas included in the alert were Douglas, Jefferson, Denver, western Arapahoe, western Adams, Broomfield, Boulder, Larimer, and Weld Counties.\n\nSurrounding areas were also asked to play their part. \"Elevated ozone will be most likely for locations in and near Denver, especially the southern and western suburbs along with the nearby foothills. For areas included in this advisory that are not expected to reach the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) air quality designation, we request that activities, such as driving non-ZEV vehicles (i.e., gas or diesel), be reduced to lessen the impacts on neighboring air quality,\" the notice said.\n\nThe alert warned vulnerable residents, such as those with lung problems or people breathing deeply due to outdoor exercise, to limit their time outside. There was an \"increasing likelihood of respiratory symptoms and breathing discomfort\" in such people, the NWS said, adding: \"Active children and adults, and people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion.\"\n\nThe warning follows a string of similar alerts across the state this summer.\n\nLast week, another Ozone Action Day Alert was announced around the Denver Metro area on Thursday and Friday, which was publicized on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAir Pollution Control Division Director Michael Ogletree, of the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE), previously told Newsweek: \"We are moving swiftly and strategically to reduce ozone pollution. We need multiple, innovative strategies to get the job done. We are striving to find sustainable solutions that meet the needs of Coloradans. We feel it's our responsibility as a state to make it easier for them to choose mass transit or to get an affordable zero-emitting car, when the time comes for them to replace their older car.\"\n\nThe alert in Colorado follows similar pleas to motorists issued by several other states in recent months.\n\nDrivers in California and Texas were urged to temporarily avoid driving gas- and diesel-powered vehicles and refrain from visiting gas stations as emissions can worsen air quality. While officials in Indiana and Alabama also looked to road-users as they attempt to tackle the problem of poor air quality and pollution.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news",

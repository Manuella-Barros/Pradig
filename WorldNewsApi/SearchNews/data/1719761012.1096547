And eventually he could destroy the world,\" De Niro fumed, reading prepared remarks on Tuesday. \"I owe this city a lot. And that's why it's so weird that Donald Trump is just across the street because he doesn't belong in my city. I don't know where he belongs, but he certainly doesn't belong here.

They have been deeply critical of Trump's conduct around the riot and said he's unfit to return to office.

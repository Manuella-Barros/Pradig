With her ballet and dance training, she was soon working with the iconic Shaw Brothers studio. While her feature debut was drama film \"Lovers' Rock,\" she became a major star in martial arts, action and swordplay movies following her breakout role in 1966 crime action film \"Come Drink With Me,\" directed by King Hu.

The film won four Oscars and with $128 million earned at the North American box office, became the first foreign-language film to gross more than $100 million in the market.\n\nHer subsequent career then spanned both sides of the Pacific Ocean, with film the titles including Hong Kong actioner \"Naked Weapon\" (alongside a young Maggie Q) and Hyde Park Entertainment's Capcom game adaptation \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li.\"\n\n\"To all her friends, colleagues, and fans, thank you for all the support you showed her over the years.

It is a rare disease with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, however, current treatments could not slow the progression. She chose not to make this news public until now, so that she could deal with her condition in private and spend her remaining time with her four children (Eugenia, Jennifer, Harry and Marsha) and her grandchildren, the family explained.

neurodegenerative disease similar to Parkinson's, her family said on Cheng's official Facebook page.\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1946, Cheng moved to Hong Kong in the 60s and started working with the city's famed Shaw Brothers Studio, which has been widely acknowledged for its role in popularising kung-fu movies to audiences beyond the Chinese city.\n\nHer breakout role came in 1966 as a swordswoman in \"Come Drink with Me\", considered one of the greatest \"wuxia\" movies -- a sword-fighting film genre that follows the adventures of martial artists around ancient China.\n\nWorking steadily through the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts films, Cheng hit international recognition in 2000 when director Ang Lee cast her as the Jade Fox in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\".\n\nHer final film was the live-action version of Disney movie Mulan in 2020, where she was the matchmaker to the eponymous heroine.\n\n\"Our mom wanted to be remembered by how she was: the legendary Queen of Martial Arts... a versatile, award-winning actress whose film and television career spanned over six decades,\" her family said.\n\nActress Michelle Yeoh, who starred opposite Cheng in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger\", expressed \"heartfelt condolences to Pei Pei Jie's (sister) family, friends and fans\".\n\n\"We will miss your kindness and shining talent,\" Yeoh wrote Friday on

She was 78.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that we announce that the rumors are true. Our mother, Cheng Pei Pei, passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones on July 17,\" her family wrote in a statement posted on Facebook Friday.\n\nThey shared that she was living with a rare, progressive disease known as corticobasal degeneration (CBD). The condition causes an increasing number of brain cells to become damaged and die over time, causing worsening problems with movement, speech, memory and swallowing, according to the UK's National Health Service website. Currently, no treatment has been shown to stop its progression.\n\n\"She chose not to make this news public so that she could deal with her condition in private and spend her remaining time with her children and grandchildren,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"To all her friends, colleagues, and fans, thank you for all the support you showed her over the years.

She and her husband had four children but eventually divorced.\n\nShe moved back to Hong Kong in the 1990s, according to HKMDB, before starring in the Oscar-winning 2000 action adventure \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" in which she played villainous fighter Jade Fox.\n\n\"I'm always up for a fight,\" Cheng told Time Out magazine in 2015. \"It's exhilarating. I've always been an active person, so when I got a chance to act out fight scenes, I was happy to oblige.\"\n\nHer final role was the matchmaker in the 2020 live-action movie \"Mulan.\"", "source":

She was 78.\n\nThe Shanghai, China native died in the San Francisco Bay Area on Thursday, July 17, after suffering from a degenerative brain disease, her representatives at Echelon Talent Management confirmed in a statement to PEOPLE on Friday, July 19.\n\n\"We are saddened by the loss of our client and dear friend Cheng Pei Pei,\" her representatives said in a statement. \"She was not only the 'Queen of Martial Arts' and the first Asian action heroine, but she was also a true hero for what she did to help others till her very last days. She will be deeply missed by all those whose lives she touched,\"\n\nVariety was first to report the news, adding that Cheng has donated her brain to medical research.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that we announce that the rumors are true. Our mother, Cheng Pei-pei, passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones on July 17,\" her family said in a statement posted to Facebook.\n\n\"In 2019, our mom was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative, atypical parkinsonism syndrome - unofficially, corticobasal degeneration (CBD). It is a rare disease with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, however, current treatments cannot slow the progression. She chose not to make this news public so that she could deal with her condition in private and spend her remaining time with her children and grandchildren.\"\n\nIn a separate statement obtained by PEOPLE, her family shared, \"She loved being an actress and knew, even with her hard work, how fortunate she was to have the career she had. Our mom remained humble and approachable, patient and kind, and always generous with her time, eager to help others whenever she could. She will be dearly missed.\"\n\nCheng is widely regarded as a pioneer of martial arts roles. Before moving to California in the 1970s, she relocated to Hong Kong and studied ballet and dance.\n\nThe training proved beneficial as she transitioned to martial arts, action and swordplay films on the heels of her breakout role in 1966's Come Drink With Me, a role which she initially obtained without \"having any formal martial arts training,\" her representatives said.\n\n\"Her background in ballet and traditional Chinese dance translated beautifully onscreen, showcasing her organic and fluid fighting moves that embodies the power and grace of her character, Golden Swallow,\" her representatives added, before stating that her \"meticulously choreographed fight scenes soon set the gold standard for later Wuxia films and the action films.\"\n\nOnce moving to America, Cheng achieved international acclaim after starring as villain Jade Fox in 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where she starred opposite Michelle Yeoh.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe motion picture saw box office success, bringing in $128 million in North America alone, making history as the first foreign-language film to gross more than $100 million in the market. The Ang Lee-directed film also won four Oscars.\n\nThroughout her career, Cheng starred in 20 Wuxia films, which were a genre of Chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists in ancient China. Her representatives noted that she \"challenged\" the \"stereotypes\" of the genre of films that often \"depicted women as weak or in supporting roles.\"\n\nRelated: 'Mulan' Praised as 'Vibrant' and 'Absolutely Fantastic' in First Reactions to Live-Action Epic\n\n\"At a time when it was most difficult, Cheng's performances redefined the notion of femininity in Asian Cinema,\" her representatives said. \"She demonstrated that women could be smart, powerful and strong, without compromising their grace or intelligence.\"\n\nIn more recent years, Cheng starred in the 2020 live action remake of Mulan. She is survived by her four children, including Harry Yuan, who is a former National Geographic host.\n\nLike her mother, Cheng's daughter Eugenia Yuan is also an actress -- appearing in Hong Kong films such as 3 Extremes II and The Eye 2 and the Australian television series Secret City.\n\nEugenia also saw success in American productions like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny and the revived Hawaii Five-O television series.

Kong's martial arts films before starring in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", has died at the age of 78, her family said Friday.\n\nShe passed away \"peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones on July 17\" after she was diagnosed in 2019 with a neurodegenerative disease similar to Parkinson's, her family said on Cheng's official Facebook page.\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1946, Cheng moved to Hong Kong in the 60s and started working with the city's famed Shaw Brothers Studio, which has been widely acknowledged for its role in popularising kung-fu movies to audiences beyond the Chinese city.\n\nHer breakout role came in 1966 as a swordswoman in \"Come Drink with Me\", considered one of the greatest \"wuxia\" movies -- a sword-fighting film genre that follows the adventures of martial artists around ancient China.\n\nWorking steadily through the golden age of Hong Kong martial arts films, Cheng hit international recognition in 2000 when director Ang Lee cast her as the Jade Fox in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\".\n\nHer final film was the live-action version of Disney movie Mulan in 2020, where she was the matchmaker to the eponymous heroine.\n\n\"Our mom wanted to be remembered by how she was: the legendary Queen of Martial Arts... a versatile, award-winning actress whose film and television career spanned over six decades,\" her family said.\n\nActress Michelle Yeoh, who starred opposite Cheng in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger\", expressed \"heartfelt condolences to Pei Pei Jie's (sister) family, friends and fans\".\n\n\"We will miss your kindness and shining talent,\" Yeoh wrote Friday on Instagram.\n\ndhc/ssy\n\nMore from this section\n\n[NEW] 2024 Best Pok\u00e9mon GO Spoofer for iPhone and Android | Tenorshare iAnyGo\n\n[Updated!] Pokemon GO

She was 78.\n\nThe Shanghai, China native died in the San Francisco Bay area on Thursday, July 17, after suffering from a degenerative brain disease, her representatives at Echelon Talent Management confirmed in a statement to PEOPLE on Friday, July 19.\n\n\"We are saddened by the loss of our client and dear friend Cheng Pei Pei,\" her representatives said in a statement. \"She was not only the 'Queen of Martial Arts' and the first Asian action heroine, but she was also a true hero for what she did to help others till her very last days. She will be deeply missed by all those whose lives she touched,\"\n\nVariety was first to report the news, adding that Cheng has donated her brain to medical research.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that we announce that the rumors are true. Our mother, Cheng Pei-pei, passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones on July 17,\" her family said in a statement posted to Facebook.\n\n\"In 2019, our mom was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative, atypical parkinsonism syndrome - unofficially, corticobasal degeneration (CBD). It is a rare disease with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, however, current treatments cannot slow the progression. She chose not to make this news public so that she could deal with her condition in private and spend her remaining time with her children and grandchildren.\"\n\nIn a separate statement obtained by PEOPLE, her family shared, \"She loved being an actress and knew, even with her hard work, how fortunate she was to have the career she had. Our mom remained humble and approachable, patient and kind, and always generous with her time, eager to help others whenever she could. She will be dearly missed.\"\n\nCheng is widely regarded as a pioneer of martial arts roles. Before moving to California in the 1970s, she relocated to Hong Kong and studied ballet and dance.\n\nThe training proved beneficial as she transitioned to martial arts, action and swordplay films on the heels of her breakout role in 1966's Come Drink With Me, a role which she initially obtained without \"having any formal martial arts training,\" her representatives said.\n\n\"Her background in ballet and traditional Chinese dance translated beautifully onscreen, showcasing her organic and fluid fighting moves that embodies the power and grace of her character, Golden Swallow,\" her representatives added, before stating that her \"meticulously choreographed fight scenes soon set the gold standard for later Wuxia films and the action films.\"\n\nOnce moving to America, Cheng achieved international acclaim after starring as villain Jade Fox in 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where she starred opposite Michelle Yeoh.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe motion picture saw box office success, bringing in $128 million in North America alone, making history as the first foreign-language film to gross more than $100 million in the market. The Ang Lee-directed film also won four Oscars.\n\nThroughout her career, Cheng starred in 20 Wuxia films, which were a genre of Chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists in ancient China. Her representatives noted that she \"challenged\" the \"stereotypes\" of the genre of films that often \"depicted women as weak or in supporting roles.\"\n\n\"At a time when it was most difficult, Cheng's performances redefined the notion of femininity in Asian Cinema,\" her representatives said. \"She demonstrated that women could be smart, powerful and strong, without compromising their grace or intelligence.\"\n\nIn more recent years, Cheng starred in the 2020 live action remake of Mulan. She is survived by her four children, including Harry Yuan, who is a former National Geographic host.\n\nLike her mother, Cheng's daughter Eugenia Yuan is also an actress -- appearing in Hong Kong films such as 3 Extremes II and The Eye 2 and the Australian television series Secret City.\n\nEugenia also saw success in American productions like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny and the revived Hawaii Five-O television series. In addition to acting, she is a former U.S. Olympic gymnast.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cheng's family confirmed the news in a statement on Facebook, revealing that she had been battling a rare neurodegenerative disorder, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), since 2019.\n\nMichelle Yeoh cast in Prime Video's 'Blade Runner 2099'\n\nIn their statement, the family expressed, \"It is with a heavy heart that we announce that the rumors are true. Our mother, Cheng Pei-pei, passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones on July 17.\" They added, \"Our mom wanted to be remembered by how she was: the legendary Queen of Martial Arts.\"\n\nCheng's career spanned six decades, during which she made an indelible mark on the film industry. She first rose to fame in the 1960s with Shaw Brothers Studios, a Hong Kong production company famous for its action films and wuxia (martial arts) epics. Cheng starred in 20 films for Shaw Brothers, including the iconic Come Drink With Me, Princess Iron Fan, and Golden Swallow. Her performance as Golden Swallow in Come Drink With Me established her as a formidable action star and solidified her place in the Chinese cinematic canon.\n\nThe return of Bruce Lee: in 'Warrior' and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1946, Cheng moved to Hong Kong in 1962, where she began her journey with Shaw Brothers Studios. Initially trained in dance, Cheng was initially groomed for roles in Chinese opera movies. However, with the studio's shift towards action films, she underwent martial arts training, which included mastering swords, knives, and horse riding -- skills that would become her trademarks in wuxia cinema.\n\nHer breakthrough came with the 1966 film Come Drink With Me, directed by King Hu. The movie is celebrated for its gripping fight choreography, in which Cheng excelled due to her dance background. In 1968, she reprised her role in Golden Swallow, though the production was marred by creative differences with director Chang Cheh, who had conservative views about women in action roles.\n\nJackie Chan, Ralph Macchio come together for new 'Karate Kid' film\n\nAfter a prolific period in Hong Kong cinema, Cheng's career slowed in the 1980s as she moved to the United States. She made a significant comeback in 2000 with Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where her portrayal of the villainous Jade Fox earned her international acclaim. The film won four Academy Awards and was a monumental success.\n\nActing legend Tony Leung to head jury for Tokyo International Film Festival\n\nCheng continued to act in the 2000s and 2010s, with notable roles in Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li (2009), Lilting (2014), Meditation Park (2017), and Disney's live-action Mulan (2020).\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com",

Our mom remained humble and approachable, patient and kind, and always generous with her time, eager to help others whenever she could. She will be dearly missed.\"\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1946, Cheng began her career in the film industry in the early Sixties when she moved to Hong Kong and trained at the studio run by the Shaw Brothers, which at the time was China's biggest production company. Cheng made her debut in the 1964 drama Lovers' Rock before she was cast as master swordswoman Golden Swallow in Come Drink With Me, a 1966 wuxia film -- or an epic Chinese martial arts period movie -- that's now considered one of the best in the genre.\n\nThe Golden Swallow role led Cheng to dozens of parts within the wuxia world, including 1966's Princess Iron Fan and Come Drink With Me's 1968 sequel Golden Swallow. While Cheng moved to California in the early Seventies, she continued to be a mainstay in Hong Kong cinema over the ensuing decades.\n\nIn 2000, Cheng reached a worldwide audience by portraying the villainous Jade Fox in director Ang Lee's wuxia-inspired epic Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a multinational production and acclaimed film that conquered the global box office and racked up 10 Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture; it won Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars, as well as similar awards at both the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs.\n\nCheng's English-language films include an appearance in 2009's Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li and her final big screen role as the Matchmaker in Disney's 2020 live-action remake of Mulan.\n\nThe actress' family also announced that Cheng's brain would be donated to the Brain Support Network, an organization that supports people diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com",

Our mom Cheng Pei Pei wanted to be remembered for who she was: the legendary Queen of Martial Arts best known for her roles such as Golden Swallow (Come Drink With Me), Madam Wah (The Flirting Scholar), and Jade Fox (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). She was a versatile, award-winning actress whose film and television career spanned six decades, not only in Asia but internationally as well in roles such as \"Junn\" (Lilting), \"Maria Wang\" (Meditation Park), and \"The Matchmaker\" (Mulan),\" said a statement from her family via Variety. \"She loved being an actress and knew, even with her hard work, how fortunate she was to have the career she had. Our mom remained humble and approachable, patient and kind, and always generous with her time, eager to help others whenever she could. She will be dearly missed.\"\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1946, Cheng began her performing arts career in ballet before she began working with the Shaw Brothers studio. She became a pioneering female martial artist with her breakout role in 1966's Come Drink With Me. After relocating to the United States, she attended business school while raising a family, per Variety. She later starred in the Oscar-winning Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which sparked a career revival that included projects like Naked Weapon, Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun Li, and the live-action remake of Mulan.\n\nIn The A.V. Club's review of Come Drink With Me, Scott Tobias wrote, \"Cheng Pei-Pei had a background in professional dance, not martial arts, and her movements suggest grace more than strength, which not only gives her character a cool, unflappable reserve, but helps transform Come Drink With Me into something that looks as much like a musical as it does a kung-fu movie. At times, it even breaks out into song. And there's magic, too, in the quiet rapport between Golden Swallow and Drunken Cat, who become partners with few words exchanged and Astaire-Rogers timing. It seems like fantasy, but the action remains more grounded and realistic than the 'wire fu' films to come. Hu and his stars just make it look easy.\"\n\nCheng is survived by her children, Eugenia, Jennifer, Harry, and Marsha, who all followed her into show business, as well as her grandchildren. Having been diagnosed with a rare neurodegenerative disease, the actor decided to donate her brain to medical research after her death. Per Variety, Cheng requested that donations be made to the Brain Support Network (BSN) where her brain was donated in lieu of flowers.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

She played skilled female pugilist Golden Swallow, who tried to rescue her brother from a group of bandits; late actor Elliot Ngok Wah played the titular swordsman nicknamed Drunken Cat.\n\nThe film cemented Cheng's status as a martial arts star, and she reprised the role in the 1968 spin-off Golden Swallow, which also featured late actors Jimmy Wang Yu and Lo Lieh.\n\nCheng went on to star in other martial arts films such as The Flying Dagger (1969), Brothers Five (1970) and The Shadow Whip (1971).", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lim_ruey_yan@straitstimes.com", "name": "Lim Ruey Yan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Pei-pei", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cheng Pei-pei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parkinson's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wang_Yu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Wang Yu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_Lieh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lo Lieh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Dai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lin Dai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Hu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Hu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dagger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaw_Brothers_Studio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaw Brothers Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelumbo_nucifera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nelumbo nucifera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swordsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swallow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kung_Fu", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kung Fu", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Indoor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745809", "eventUri": "eng-9745809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 372, "textEnd": 379}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 536, "textEnd": 543}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Per Variety today (July 19), Cheng had long suffered from a degenerative brain disease and has donated her brain to medical research.\n\nBest known for her high-octane martial arts films, Cheng's breakout role was in 1966's Come Drink With Me by director King Hu. She spent the majority of the following decade or so starring in several significant Hong Kong action films -- she then stepped out of the spotlight after 1974 when she moved to California to raise her family.\n\nAfter a handful of roles in the 1980s, she resumed her acting career, starting with 1993's Flirting Scholar. She would make a cameo in 1994's Wing Chun, which starred a then-rising Michelle Yeoh. The two would go on to work together on the award-winning 2000 film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where she played villain Jade Fox.\n\nHaving been through the development of Hong Kong cinema since the 1960s, Cheng remembered how it \"wasn't uncommon\" for women to take on lead acting roles. \"Compared to the male actors, directors were overprotective of us,\" she told Time Out Hong Kong in 2015. \"But, I didn't need any special treatment. I'm very proud, and competitive to a fault. I thought, 'if a man can do it, so can I'.\"\n\nIn the same interview, she noted how the tides turned during the 1970s - around the same time as her move to California and brief retirement from acting: \"Around the time of Ricky Hui, men started taking the lead and women became wallflowers. Audiences gravitated more towards the raw strength of a man.\"\n\nCheng's last onscreen role was 2020's live-action Mulan, where she played the minor role of The Matchmaker.\n\nToday, her former co-star Michelle Yeoh shared a few words on Instagram in tribute to Cheng. \"Heartfelt condolences to Pei Pei Jie's family, friends and fans,\" Yeoh wrote. \"We will miss your kindness and shining talent RIP \ud83d\ude4f\u2728\".\n\nFans and critics also reacted to the news, with many noting her significant contributions to Hong Kong cinema.\n\n\"From Golden Sparrow to Jade Fox, the legendary Cheng Pei-pei defined what a swordswoman can be on the big screen,\" film programmer Frank Yan wrote.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_peters@nme.com", "name": "Daniel Peters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Pei-pei", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cheng Pei-pei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_action_cinema", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong action cinema"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Yeoh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Yeoh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Hu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King Hu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVB_Jade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TVB Jade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of Hong Kong"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wing Chun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Hui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Hui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time Out (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ChengPeiPei-Getty.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745809", "eventUri": "eng-9745809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 237, "textEnd": 244}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 266, "textEnd": 273}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It is a rare [brain] disease with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, however, current treatments cannot slow the progression,\" the statement reads.\n\nMs. Cheng shared four children with her ex-husband, businessman Yuan Wen-tung: Jennifer Yuan, filmmaker Harry Yuan, actress Marsha Yuan, and Eugenia Yuan, an actress and former U.S. Olympic gymnast.\n\nMs. Cheng's children said the actress chose not to disclose her diagnosis to the public \"so that she could deal with her condition in private and spend her remaining time with her children and grandchildren.\" They also expressed gratitude to Ms. Cheng's friends, colleagues, and fans for their support over the years.\n\n\"Our mom wanted to be remembered by how she was: the legendary Queen of Martial Arts... a versatile, award-winning actress whose film and television career spanned over six decades, not only in Asia but internationally as well,\" her children wrote.\n\n\"She loved being an actress and knew, even with her hard work, how fortunate she was to have the career she had. Our mom remained humble and approachable, patient and kind, and always generous with her time, eager to help others whenever she could. She will be dearly missed.\"\n\nMs. Cheng's brain was donated to the Brain Support Network nonprofit to help advance research on corticobasal degeneration and other rare neurological diseases, her children noted.\n\nShortly after her death, Ms. Marsha Yuan took to Instagram to share a touching tribute to her mother.\n\n\"I love my mother so much that the pain of losing her is almost unbearable. She was such a strong, beautiful, caring, funny, cute, unselfish, loving, generous role model of a mother. She always put us first and I can only hope that I will have a relationship with my son as my mother had with each of her children. A relationship that was open, honest, and empathetic,\" she continued.\n\n\"I just wanted to be a dancer,\" she previously said in an interview with Kung Fu Magazine. \"Because you don't need to talk to express yourself, I could use my body.\"\n\nHowever, she told the publication that she also enjoyed watching films growing up. When she was 16, Ms. Cheng moved to Hong Kong to pursue a film career, enrolling in an acting course at the prestigious film production company Shaw Brothers in 1963. She garnered her first movie role that year, starring in the film \"The Magic Lamp,\" going on to perform in 1964's \"Lovers' Rock.\"\n\nMs. Cheng married Mr. Yuan in 1970, and shortly thereafter, the couple moved to the United States, where the actress enrolled in a business program at the University of California, Irvine in Southern California's Orange County. After their divorce in 1987, Ms. Cheng moved back to Hong Kong and began acting again, starring in \"Painted Faces\" (1988), \"Flying Dagger\" (1993), and \"Lover's Lover\" (1994), among others.\n\nIn 2000, the actress garnered a leading role in the action film \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" directed by Ang Lee and starring Michelle Yeoh. Ms. Cheng's performance in the cult classic earned her the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2001.\n\nMore recently, Ms. Cheng played a matchmaker in the 2020 live-action film \"Mulan,\" which starred Jet Li, Jason Scott Lee, Donnie Yen, and Liu Yifei.\n\nHowever, despite her successes in the martial arts film genre, Ms. Cheng told Kung Fu Magazine that she never considered herself \"a martial arts lady.\"\n\n\"I'm really a dancer,\" she said. \"I tell my children that it's a bonus to be a dancer because you are graceful, can kick high, bend low.\"\n\nMs. Cheng is survived by her four children and grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Reports revealed that Cheng had been suffering from a rare nervous system disorder for which there is currently no effective cure. The renowned actress had specified that she wished to donate her brain for medical research. To respect her last wishes, her body will also be donated to the University of Hong Kong for study.\n\nKnown for her chivalric female roles, Cheng was regarded as the first female martial arts performer in Hong Kong cinema. Born in Shanghai in 1946, she moved to Hong Kong in her youth and embarked on a dazzling career, which lasted for around six decades. Among her numerous acclaimed roles, her performance in the Hong Kong comedy film Flirting Scholar alongside Stephen Chow Sing-chi and Gong Li helped her ascend to the heights of her career.

Her family confirmed the news in a Facebook post on Friday, July 19, which revealed that she had been living with a rare disease, which she preferred to keep private.\n\nRemembered for Iconic Roles\n\nIn a film and television career spanning over six decades, the Shanghai-born actress who trained under Shaw Brothers Studio and later starred in numerous Shaw Brothers films, made a breakthrough with King Hu's (\u80e1\u91d1\u9293) action crime classic Come Drink with Me <\u5927\u9189\u4fe0>. Starring in classic martial arts films like Golden Swallow <\u91d1\u71d5\u5b50>, Dragon Swamp <\u6bd2\u9f8d\u6f6d>, The Thundering Sword <\u795e\u528d\u9707\u6c5f\u6e56>, she left the glamor of showbiz in 1971 after marrying wealthy businessman Yuan Wen-tung (\u539f\u6587\u901a) and moved to the United States.\n\nJust like the onscreen heroines and classic roles she played, the actress was known for her passionate and fearless nature, yet faced intense pressure to bear a son for her husband, revealing in an interview that she mistakenly saw childbearing as sort of a \"homework of marriage\". Though the couple have three daughters and a son, the relationship ended in divorce after 17 years.\n\nBefore filming Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon <\u81e5\u864e\u85cf\u9f8d>, Ang Lee (\u674e\u5b89) insisted on casting a legendary martial arts actress for the villainous \"Jade Fox,\" a role that could only be played by Cheng, which she was happy to take on.\n\nShe won the Best Supporting Actress award at the 2001 Hong Kong Film Awards for this role, the only Hong Kong Film Award she received in her career.\n\nIn her later years, she faded from the film industry but garnered attention again through Chinese reality show Divas Hit the Road <\u82b1\u5152\u8207\u5c11\u5e74>, attracting young fans and forming a close friendship with Chinese actress Liu Tao (\u5289\u6fe4), who often referred to Cheng as her \"forever confidante\".\n\nEven as a martial arts superstar, the mother of four was deeply devoted to Buddhism. During the filming of Legendary Fighter: Yang's Heroine <\u6768\u95e8\u5973\u5c07>, she revealed in an interview that she was copying Buddhist scriptures and participating in many Buddhist activities. Early in her career, she had thoughts of becoming a nun, but was persuaded otherwise by famous Chinese monk Master Hsing Yun, who told her that her worldly ties were not yet severed, leading to her illustrious career.", "source": {"uri": "jaynestars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JayneStars.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Pei-pei", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cheng Pei-pei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaw_Brothers_Studio", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shaw Brothers Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Hu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King Hu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuan dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVB_Jade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TVB Jade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Film_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong Film Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ang Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divas_Hit_the_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divas Hit the Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_Fighter:_Yang's_Heroine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legendary Fighter: Yang's Heroine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Tao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liu Tao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_texts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddhist texts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsing_Yun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hsing Yun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745809", "eventUri": "eng-9745809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 174, "textEnd": 181}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The former first minister apologised for the Scottish Government\u2019s failure to dual the A9 between Perth and Inverness by 2025 at Holyrood on Wednesday. She told the inquiry probing the decade-long delay to the project that she was not apologising because the Scottish Government has \u201cmessed up\u201d. But because the \u00a33 billion project had faced significant challenges beyond their control, including from Brexit and the Covid pandemic. She said: \u201cI want to be clear that I do not accept that the failure to meet that target was because we just didn\u2019t bother and we weren\u2019t trying to meet that target.\u201d \u2018Very lame excuses\u2019 But Laura Hansler from the A9 Dual Action Group, who attended the evidence session at Holyrood, hit out at the \u201csoft apology\u201d and \u201clame excuses\u201d from Ms Sturgeon. She said: \u201cWhen somebody in their opening statement automatically goes to blame Brexit, Covid, the cost of living crisis and Ukraine\u2026you just take pause at that moment and just think this is really quite disappointing. \u201cIt\u2019s very lame excuses that we\u2019ve heard before. For me, the only positive that came out of that entire meeting was the fact she would support a national memorial to those that have lost their lives up here.\u201d Ms Sturgeon was deputy first minister in 2011 when the Scottish Government committed to fully upgrading the road, which runs between Perth and Inverness, to dual-carriageway by 2025. \u2018Significant hurdles\u2019 In December 2023, the Government admitted this was not achievable, saying it will be 2035 before the work is complete. Ms Sturgeon said that by 2017 or 2018, it was realised \u201cthere are significant hurdles\u201d to completing the project on time. But that it was \u201conly at that late 2022, early 2023 point it was clear there was no viable route to 2025\u201d. She said the government was so determined to find a way forward that they \u201cdidn\u2019t tell themselves quickly enough\u201d that it wasn\u2019t possible because they \u201cdesperately wanted\u201d to deliver the scheme by 2025. Ms Sturgeon\u2019s predecessor Alex Salmond previously told the inquiry he believes the project became less of a priority after he left government in 2014. Ms Hansler, who lives in Kincraig, in the Highlands, accused Ms Sturgeon of \u201cspin\u201d. She added: \u201cThe will just wasn\u2019t there so how she can come away with that kind of statement when she knew back in 2017. \u201cShe must have known in 2017 that they were never ever going to deliver on 2025. \u201cShe should have been far more open and she should have told parliament that this was not going to happen. \u201cShe should have told the Highlands but for some reason they chose not to.\u201d Meanwhile, David Richardson, Federation of Small Businesses\u2019 Highlands & Islands development manager, said the road must be dualled if the region is to attract and retain younger people and families at a time of population decline. He added: \u201cThe A9 is the main artery that keeps the Highlands and north alive, enabling people and goods to travel between more far-flung parts and the central belt, and vice versa, but we all know that it is slow, dangerous and discouraging \u2013 a disincentive to travel. \u201cThe delay is hugely disappointing, but what matters now is that every sinew is strained by all those involved to get the job done as quickly as possible. It\u2019s not just lives that we are trying to protect and save, it\u2019s economies and communities.\u201d", "summary": "Campaigner Laura Hansler spoke to the P&#38;J after Nicola Sturgeon appeared before a Holyrood committee probing A9 dualling.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/6485514/a9-dualling-campaigners-nicola-sturgeon-apology/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/A9-and-Sturgeon-18onzvh1l-gct97927.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:01:47", "author": "Adele Merson", "authors": ["Adele Merson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.708}

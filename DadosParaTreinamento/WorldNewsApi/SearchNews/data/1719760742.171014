We might know why", "text": "There\u2019s a broken link in the food chain of California\u2019s brown pelicans, adding a sad chapter to one of conservation\u2019s most striking success stories. Emaciated birds are turning up in California\u2019s ponds, reservoirs, backyards and even San Francisco\u2019s Oracle Park during a baseball game \u2014 far from their wild ocean home. Wildlife centers are inundated with the gangly, prehistoric-looking seabirds, nursing them back to health with fluids, fish and medications, but the cost is a staggering $1,500 per bird. Injuries can easily double the cost. \u201cThey\u2019re feathered skeletons,\u201d said Rebecca Duerr, director of research and veterinary science at International Bird Rescue, which is treating 200 pelicans at its Fairfield center and 70 pelicans in Los Angeles. \u201cHunched over and folded up.\u201d For weeks, scientists have been perplexed by this tragic die-off. Other birds are doing fine. Now they have a theory: There\u2019s food, but the pelicans can\u2019t reach it. It\u2019s too deep, or too far offshore. While heartbreaking, the deaths are a natural fluctuation that does not doom the species \u2014 unless it continues, said seabird biologists Jim Howard of the California Institute of Environmental Studies and David Mazurkiewicz of Channel Islands National Park, who monitor breeding colonies. Smaller crises have been noted in previous years \u2014 2022, 2018, 2012 and 2010 \u2014 but not at the current scale. Many of those birds had the same symptoms: emaciated, dehydrated, critically low body temperatures. Fortunately, populations rebounded. \u201cIf we begin to see more frequency in these events, it could be cause for concern over a long time period,\u201d said Mazurkiewicz. The brown pelican, whose wingspan measures seven feet, is beloved for its soaring flight and dramatic capture of prey, with a headfirst dive in the water from great heights. After 40 million years of survival, the species has faced many recent existential threats. In the late 1800s, pelicans were hunted for food and feathers. During World War I, they were seen as competitors for the sardines needed to feed troops, so were shot by fishermen. In the 1960s, the insecticide DDT caused their eggs to weaken, then crack. Even today, they face ongoing danger from fish hooks. The Endangered Species Act protected the birds from extinction in 1970. By 2009, the population soared so high that it was no longer officially protected, and now the total population of brown pelicans ranges from 30,000 to 40,000 in California, according to Howard. So far this year, 707 birds have been brought into care facilities for treatment, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Of these, about half are still in care or recovered and have been released. The other half died or had to be euthanized. Many more have died in the wild, unnoticed. Birds that normally weigh 6 to 10 pounds are now 5 to 8 pounds, said Duerr. Without enough fat to stay warm, their body temperatures have plummeted from 104 to 98 degrees, or colder. They\u2019re anemic. They\u2019re dehydrated. And they\u2019re often injured, because hungry pelicans take extra risks, venturing near fishing hooks and lines. In Santa Cruz, Native Animal Rescue has taken in 215 brown pelicans, compared to 35 last year. SPCA Monterey has rescued 109 pelicans. Even the San Francisco Peninsula, far inland from the birds\u2019 natural range, is getting them. \u201cWe had been getting flooded with calls about dead pelicans and pelicans in distress,\u201d said Colleen Crowley of Peninsula Humane Society and SPCA in Burlingame. The birds are looking for food wherever they can find it. In the past weeks, they\u2019ve been seen in San Rafael\u2019s Las Gallinas Wildlife Ponds, Vasona Lake in Los Gatos and Almaden Lake and Calero Reservoir in San Jose. A social animal, it is rarely found alone. So it was startling to see a sole pelican land in the outfield during the fifth inning of a Giants-Reds game earlier this month. Baseball fans were charmed \u2014 but that\u2019s not normal pelican behavior. Experts are struggling to identify what\u2019s behind the strange behavior. One initial suspect was domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by microscopic algae. Another was a disease, like avian flu. But those causes have been ruled out. The birds are simply starving. Now the focus is on the northern anchovy, the primary food of pelicans. The tiny fish gather in big black clouds that sparkle underwater and can drop deep, or swim far out to sea. When food is plentiful, pelicans store up sufficient energy to produce eggs, incubate and feed as many as three chicks. But overfishing and warm waters are threatening their breeding populations in the Gulf of Mexico, said experts. And this winter there was very little food, said seabird ecologist Enriqueta Velarde of Universidad Veracruzana in Jalapa, Mexico. This resulted in near-complete reproductive failure. Then the birds left for California, she said. \u201cThey moved up here early. And some of them were here all winter, which is very unusual for us,\u201d said Bart Selby of the NOAA Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Conservation Working Group, who bands pelicans. Typically, large numbers start arriving at the end of June. This year\u2019s anchovy count is down a bit, after several years of growth, Thompson said. And the fish might be further off shore, so it\u2019s harder for pelicans to find them. \u201cThe majority of the anchovies have moved,\u201d said commercial fisherman Richard Ogg of Bodega Bay. \u201cEarlier this year, I saw very large schools of pinhead anchovies. However, as it turned out, the wind kicked up, the water got cold, and the anchovies disappeared.\u201d The fish don\u2019t like rough water, so the cold and windy storms of April and early May likely pushed the anchovies deeper, said Thompson. Pelicans only plunge a few feet deep. And surface waves obscure the birds\u2019 visibility. \u201cWhatever is affecting the anchovies \u2014 within the water column or across the continental shelf \u2014 is going to affect the pelicans,\u201d said Deborah Jaques of Pacific Eco Logic in Crescent City, who surveys roosts from Pismo Beach to Crescent City. \u201cIf that changes, it can suddenly put the pelicans out of business.\u201d This occurred at a critical time in the bird\u2019s life cycle. \u201cNature can be very cruel in our eyes sometimes,\u201d said Ogg. \u201cBut there is a reason for all that occurs, whether we see it or not. We can only try to learn and understand the possibilities.\u201d", "summary": "Emaciated birds are turning up in reservoirs, backyards and even San Francisco\u2019s Oracle Park \u2014 far from their wild ocean home.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/05/29/pelicans-are-starving-we-might-know-why/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SJM-PELICAN-7.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:55:37", "author": "Lisa M.

Tim Scott (R-SC) after he tried to flip every question about Donald Trump into an attack on President Joe Biden. During a Sunday interview on CNN, Bash noted that some Republicans like Steve Bannon had suggested Biden tried to assassinate Trump because a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago authorized deadly force. \"Federal prosecutors are now asking for a gag order in that classified documents case after the former president said that FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago were, quote, locked and loaded, ready to take me out, and that he nearly escaped death,\" Bash noted. \"But, Senator, that same language was also in the order for President Biden's home.\" \"So, do you agree with the attorney general that this is not only false, what the former president said, but extremely dangerous?\" the CNN host asked. \"I haven't found myself agreeing with Attorney General Garland on any issue,\" Scott replied. \"I will say I saw the video of the SWAT team from the FBI raiding Mar-a-Lago. I have not seen the same video of them raiding Joe Biden's garage. So I'd love to have that comparison.\" According to Scott, Trump faced a \"two-tiered justice system.\" But Bash pushed back. \"The reality is that, I mean, just using this case as an example, it's not two tiers if you have the Justice Department, which is the Justice Department, as Joe Biden is currently president, also going in to get classified documents into his house,\" Bash pointed out. \"And what I really am asking you about is the language being used, which is misleading.\" \"People like Steve Bannon called this an assassination attempt,\" Bash said. \"Doesn't that kind of language concern you?\" Scott, however, appeared not to be concerned about the dangerous language used by Trump supporters. \"Well, I will simply say that watching the treatment of Joe Biden by the justice system, when they have found him unable to stand before a jury of his peers because he's too old, frankly, and his memory is shot, that is not the kind of simple, fair justice system that Americans expect,\" Scott said.

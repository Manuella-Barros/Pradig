And why is he unseeded?", "text": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 The French tennis federation put off holding a ceremony to celebrate Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros this year, because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament he has won a record 14 times. Tournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn\u2019t want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference. \u201cAs you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But \u2026 because he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\u201d Mauresmo said. \u201cIt\u2019s his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we\u2019re not going to do it this year. That\u2019s his wish,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\u201d Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. Here are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev: Why are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round? Despite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250. Why isn\u2019t Nadal seeded? This is Nadal\u2019s first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \u201cgiving protection to some players\u201d would result in \u201ca lot of other issues and problems,\u201d and because \u201cit also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\u201d What difference do seedings make? Players who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship. What do other players think? Players tend to agree with Mauresmo\u2019s decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \u201cThe way that the seedings work, I think it\u2019s appropriate. In this case, it\u2019s unfortunate how that happened, but I don\u2019t know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn\u2019t be seeded based on past or previous success,\u201d said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \u201cIt\u2019d be quite hard to do that.\u201d Who is Alexander Zverev? He is a leading player in men\u2019s tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \u201cAt the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn\u2019t do,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cThat\u2019s, at the end of the day, what\u2019s going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\u201d Why is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case? Mauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev\u2019s status and replied: \u201cAs long as the trial isn\u2019t finished and there isn\u2019t a decision, he\u2019s considered innocent and so that\u2019s why he\u2019s allowed to be part of the draw.\u201d ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP\u2019s tennis writer since 2002.

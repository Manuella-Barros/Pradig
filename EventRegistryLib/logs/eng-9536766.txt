Andrew Dudum, who identifies as Palestinian-American, voiced support for the student protesters across US campuses on X. 'Moral courage > College degree,' the CEO, 35, wrote on Wednesday.\n\n'If you're currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university's divestment from Israel , keep going. It's working. There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline. Dudum then shared a link to apply for a job at HIMS, an online pharmacy that also includes the HERS brand and offers products for erectile dysfunction, anxiety and skincare. Critics were quick to react to Dudum's message, with many social media users saying they will be cancelling their HIMS subscriptions and asking others to do the same.\n\nConservative writer Ben Domenech wrote: 'If you support Israel, cancel your HIMS subscription s immediately. You can get similar products elsewhere for cheaper anyway.' Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of software company Palantir Technologies, also weighed in, saying 'Real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob, chanting anti-US and other woke Pablum, following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all yet being indignantly righteous, while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students.' Many pointed out that Dudum may be harming the interest of shareholders who may not agree with him, given that HIMS is a publicly-traded company.\n\nOthers shared screenshots of the cancelation of their subscription, with one X user writing as the reason: 'Your CEO supports Hamas.' Dudum, who has said he has family in Gaza and the West Bank, founded HIMS in 2017. He wrote a blog post in November calling for a ceasefire and lamenting that companies were still supporting Israel after its counterattack had already killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians.\n\n'Now, a month past the October 7th attack, we find ourselves in a world where Israel has killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians with over 4,000 innocent children in a military response that nearly all international experts decry as violations of international law and human rights,' Dudum wrote. And the messages of unequivocal support for Israel are still sitting on our corporate pages -- untouched nor updated.'\n\nIn the Medium post, Dudum described himself as 'a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland.' The entrepreneur, who is also an accomplished cellist, was born and raised in San Francisco and dropped out from the prestigious Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Dudum's stand comes in contrast with other CEOs who have said they will not hire students participating in the pro-Palestine protests.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to HIMS for comment on this story. Police have arrested nearly 2,200 people during pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the United States in recent weeks, sometimes using riot gear, tactical vehicles and flash-bang devices to clear tent encampments and occupied buildings. More than 100 people were taken into custody during a Columbia crackdown, just a fraction of the total arrests stemming from recent campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nA tally by The Associated Press recorded at least 56 incidents of arrests at 43 different US colleges or universities since April 18. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies. Early Thursday, officers surged against a crowd of demonstrators at University of California, Los Angeles, ultimately taking at least 200 protesters into custody after hundreds defied orders to leave, some forming human chains as police fired flash-bangs to break up the crowds. Police tore apart a fortified encampment's barricade of plywood, pallets, metal fences and dumpsters, then pulled down canopies and tents.\n\nLike at UCLA, tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across other campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century. Israel has branded the protests anti-Semitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making anti-Semitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday defended the right of students to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days. The demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 with students calling for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on October 7 and took roughly 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

If there was ever a sell signal, this is it,\" one X user replied.\n\n\"If you support Israel, cancel your HIMS subscription s immediately.

He founded his hair loss company, HIMS, in 2017.\n\nIn a blog post in November, Dudum called for a ceasefire amid the ongoing war and slammed the companies who were still backing Israel amid the killing of innocent Palestinians. Over 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far.\n\nIn a post on Medium, American-Palestinian identified as a \"father whose children are both the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland and Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948\".\n\nDudum, who was born and raised in San Francisco, was expelled from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School.\n\nOver 2,000 people have been arrested across college campuses amid the ongoing pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

I am deeply saddened that my support for peaceful protest has been interpreted by some as encouraging violence, intimidation, or bigotry of any kind.\n\n'I do believe deeply in the right for people to use their voices in peaceful protest to drive change. This right is critical to our democracy and must be protected.... Generations of Americans have engaged in non-violent protest...\n\n'As a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland, as I have previously shared, I have a personal appreciation for the different perspectives people have which I live with daily at my dinner table. I hope and pray for peace and for an end to violence everywhere.'\n\nAndrew Dudum, who identifies as Palestinian-American, clarified his previous comments in which he offered jobs to the university protesters\n\nDudum's clarification comes after critics unleashed a boycott of the company, which has seen its stock fall by more than 10 percent over the last five days.\n\nHims stock dropped 8 percent on Friday, wiping out nearly $210 million in stock value in just one day.\n\nThe CEO previously said of the protests: 'Moral courage > College degree,' the CEO, 35, wrote on Wednesday. 'If you're currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university's divestment from Israel, keep going. It's working. There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline.'\n\nThe significant drop came just two days after Dudum's controversial post - which sparked immediate backlash - though it's unclear whether the recent drop is directly related.\n\nThe 10 percent decrease in price comes amid a 14 percent downward trend since May 1, when its price was $13.10.\n\nUniversity of Georgia pro-Palestinian students protest in front of the UGA arch in Athens on Friday\n\nDemonstrators at a pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus of the University of Chicago\n\nThe company's chief legal officer had also pre-arranged a sale of $31,000 worth of stock in September that was put into affect on May 1 - which could explain why investors are pulling stock out of the company since then.\n\nLast week, conservative writer Ben Domenech wrote of Dudum: 'If you support Israel, cancel your HIMS subscriptions immediately. You can get similar products elsewhere for cheaper anyway.'\n\nJoe Lonsdale, co-founder of software company Palantir Technologies, also weighed in, saying, 'Real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob, chanting anti-U.S. and other woke Pablum, following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all yet being indignantly righteous, while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students.'\n\nREAD MORE: CEO of hair loss company HIMS sparks outrage by offering campus protestors jobs\n\nAndrew Dudum, who identifies as Palestinian-American, voiced support for the student protestors across US campuses on X\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany pointed out that Dudum may be harming the interest of shareholders who may not agree with him, given that HIMS is a publicly traded company.\n\nOthers shared screenshots of the cancelation of their subscription, with one X user writing as the reason: 'Your CEO supports Hamas.'\n\nDudum, who has said he has family in Gaza and the West Bank, founded HIMS in 2017.\n\nIn his comments on Sunday, Dudum linked to a blog post he posted in November calling for a ceasefire and lamenting that companies were still supporting Israel after its counterattack had already killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians.\n\n'Now, a month past the October 7th attack, we find ourselves in a world where Israel has killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians with over 4,000 innocent children in a military response that nearly all international experts decry as violations of international law and human rights,' Dudum wrote.\n\nAnd the messages of unequivocal support for Israel are still sitting on our corporate pages -- untouched nor updated.'\n\nIn the Medium post, Dudum described himself as 'a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland.'\n\nThe entrepreneur, who is also an accomplished cellist, was born and raised in San Francisco and dropped out from the prestigious Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHe is married to Lea Dessi-Olive, CFO at floss company Cocofloss.\n\nDessi-Olive's last activity on X show she is also passionate about the Palestinian cause, as she shared posts accusing Israel of apartheid.\n\nIn another post from September, 2021, she shared a video of John Legend criticizing Israel. The couple also shared a picture with the singer the same month.\n\nDudum is married to Lea Dessi-Olive, CFO at Cocofloss. They are seen with John Legend\n\nDessi-Olive's last activity on X show she is also passionate about the Palestinian cause, as she shared posts accusing Israel of apartheid\n\nDudum's stand comes in contrast with other CEOs who have said they will not hire students participating in the pro-Palestine protests.\n\nBill Ackman, head of Pershing Square Capital Management, announced that he would not hire students from Harvard who signed a letter allegedly blaming Israel for Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.\n\n'Shark Tank' star Kevin O'Leary said that pro-Palestinian are 'screwed' because companies will be able to use AI technology in the hiring process to weed out any supports of the anti-Israel movement and refuse to hire them.\n\n'Here's your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with a picture of you burning a flag. See that one. That goes in this pile over here, cause I can get the same person's talent in this pile that's not burning anything,' O'Leary said on Fox News' 'The Five' on Wednesday.\n\nPolice have arrested nearly 2,200 people during pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the United States in recent weeks, sometimes using riot gear, tactical vehicles and flash-bang devices to clear tent encampments and occupied buildings.\n\nMore than 100 people were taken into custody during a Columbia crackdown, just a fraction of the total arrests stemming from recent campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nA tally by The Associated Press recorded at least 56 incidents of arrests at 43 different US colleges or universities since April 18. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.\n\nIsrael has branded the protests anti-Semitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition.\n\nAlthough some protesters have been caught on camera making anti-Semitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday defended the right of students to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days.\n\nThe demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 with students calling for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there.\n\nIsrael launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on October 7 and took roughly 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel.", "source": {"uri":

He's offering rioters jobs. I will never do another ad read for this company and I'll be doing what I like to call, an opposite ad read today too.\"\n\nSharkInvesting.com founder James DePorre told Dudum, \"Good luck.

Andrew Dudum, who identifies as Palestinian-American, last week sparked uproar by offering jobs to the campus protesters at Columbia and other schools. Share holders sold off their positions and customers canceled their subscriptions in a boycott that tanked the company's value.\n\nOn Sunday night, Dudum took to X to 'clarify' his comments, toning down his full-throated support after a wave of backlash. 'I, in no way condone nor support acts or threats of violence, antisemitism, or intimidation and there is absolutely no justification for violence on our campuses... I am deeply saddened that my support for peaceful protest has been interpreted by some as encouraging violence, intimidation, or bigotry of any kind. 'I do believe deeply in the right for people to use their voices in peaceful protest to drive change. This right is critical to our democracy and must be protected.... Generations of Americans have engaged in non-violent protest...\n\n'As a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland , as I have previously shared, I have a personal appreciation for the different perspectives people have which I live with daily at my dinner table. I hope and pray for peace and for an end to violence everywhere.' Dudum's clarification comes after critics unleashed a boycott of the company, which has seen its stock fall by more than 10 percent over the last five days. Hims stock dropped 8 percent on Friday, wiping out nearly $210 million in stock value in just one day.\n\nThe CEO previously said of the protests: 'Moral courage > College degree,' the CEO, 35, wrote on Wednesday. 'If you're currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university's divestment from Israel , keep going. It's working. There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline.' The significant drop came just two days after Dudum's controversial post - which sparked immediate backlash - though it's unclear whether the recent drop is directly related. The 10 percent decrease in price comes amid a 14 percent downward trend since May 1, when its price was $13.10.\n\nThe company's chief legal officer had also pre-arranged a sale of $31,000 worth of stock in September that was put into effect on May 1 - which could explain why investors are pulling stock out of the company since then. Last week, conservative writer Ben Domenech wrote of Dudum: 'If you support Israel, cancel your HIMS subscriptions immediately. You can get similar products elsewhere for cheaper anyway.' Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of software company Palantir Technologies, also weighed in, saying, 'Real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob, chanting anti-U.S. and other woke Pablum, following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all yet being indignantly righteous, while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students.'\n\nMany pointed out that Dudum may be harming the interest of shareholders who may not agree with him, given that HIMS is a publicly traded company. Others shared screenshots of the cancelation of their subscription, with one X user writing as the reason: 'Your CEO supports Hamas.' Dudum, who has said he has family in Gaza and the West Bank, founded HIMS in 2017. In his comments on Sunday, Dudum linked to a blog post he posted in November calling for a ceasefire and lamenting that companies were still supporting Israel after its counterattack had already killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians. 'Now, a month past the October 7th attack, we find ourselves in a world where Israel has killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians with over 4,000 innocent children in a military response that nearly all international experts decry as violations of international law and human rights,' Dudum wrote.\n\nAnd the messages of unequivocal support for Israel are still sitting on our corporate pages -- untouched nor updated.' In the Medium post, Dudum described himself as 'a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland.' The entrepreneur, who is also an accomplished cellist, was born and raised in San Francisco and dropped out from the prestigious Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is married to Lea Dessi-Olive, CFO at floss company Cocofloss. Dessi-Olive's last activity on X shows she is also passionate about the Palestinian cause, as she shared posts accusing Israel of apartheid. In another post from September 2021, she shared a video of John Legend criticizing Israel. The couple also shared a picture with the singer the same month. Dudum's stand comes in contrast with other CEOs who have said they will not hire students participating in the pro-Palestine protests.\n\nBill Ackman, head of Pershing Square Capital Management, announced that he would not hire students from Harvard who signed a letter allegedly blaming Israel for Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel. 'Shark Tank' star Kevin O'Leary said that pro-Palestinian are 'screwed' because companies will be able to use AI technology in the hiring process to weed out any supports of the anti-Israel movement and refuse to hire them. 'Here's your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with a picture of you burning a flag. See that one. That goes in this pile over here, cause I can get the same person's talent in this pile that's not burning anything,' O'Leary said on Fox News' ' The Five ' on Wednesday. Police have arrested nearly 2,200 people during pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the United States in recent weeks, sometimes using riot gear, tactical vehicles and flash-bang devices to clear tent encampments and occupied buildings.\n\nMore than 100 people were taken into custody during a Columbia crackdown, just a fraction of the total arrests stemming from recent campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war. A tally by The Associated Press recorded at least 56 incidents of arrests at 43 different US colleges or universities since April 18. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies. Israel has branded the protests anti-Semitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making anti-Semitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday defended the right of students to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days. The demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 with students calling for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on October 7 and took roughly 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

In January, Dudum tagged Anne Wojcicki, CEO of 23andMe, in a post chastising her service for not listing him as being descendent from Palestinians.\n\n\"The systematic erasure of Palestinians is everywhere,\" Dudum wrote. \"I just completed a @23andMe report. They don't even show Palestine, despite both sides of my family lineage dating back & documented in Jaffa, Jerusalem and Ramallah to the time of Christ.\"\n\nDudum co-founded LendforPeace.org in 2007, according to his Linkedin profile. The website focused on \"providing direct micro-loans to Palestinian women in the West Bank and Gaza,\" according to Dudum's included description.\n\nHims media affairs did not immediately respond to

I am deeply saddened that my support for peaceful protest has been interpreted by some as encouraging violence, intimidation, or bigotry of any kind.\"\n\nHIMS & HERS STOCK SLIDES AFTER CEO'S PRAISE FOR ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS\n\nThis comes after Dudum, whose company provides telehealth services and prescription medication for issues such as hair loss, erectile dysfunction and skin problems, said Wednesday that demonstrators' future employment is not as important as standing up for the cause they believe in.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"Moral courage > College degree If you're currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university's divestment from Israel, keep going,\" Dudum wrote on X. \"It's working. There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline.\"\n\nDudum, a Palestinian-American, also provided a link for protesters to apply for a job at his company.\n\nThis also comes after Hims & Hers saw its stock slide by 8% Friday amid criticism over Dudum's Wednesday post.\n\nHIMS FOUNDER OFFERS JOBS TO ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS, HAILS THEIR 'MORAL COURAGE'\n\nIn his follow-up thread on Sunday, Dudum said he believes in the right for people to peacefully protest and call for change, emphasizing that the right to freedom of expression \"must be protected.\"\n\n\"I do believe deeply in the right for people to use their voices in peaceful protest to drive change,\" he said. \"This right is critical to our democracy and must be protected. Our world today is more just because students throughout history have courageously taken to their campuses and used their voices to force change. Generations of Americans have engaged in non-violent protest, and these movements have led to some of the most important changes in our country's history.\"\n\nDudum said he has a \"personal appreciation\" for different perspectives people may have, since his children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948 and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland.\n\n\"As a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland, as I have previously shared, I have a personal appreciation for the different perspectives people have which I live with daily at my dinner table,\" he said. \"I hope and pray for peace and for an end to violence everywhere.\"\n\nHe also provided a link to a post on Medium he wrote in November in which he took issue with many companies offering \"unequivocal support\" for Israel after Hamas' \"horrendous\" Oct. 7 attack against the Jewish State.\n\nNoting the estimated number of Palestinian deaths from the war at that point, Dudum stressed the importance of \"nuance\" when CEOs release statements about the war.\n\n\"The sheer strength and volume of those initial messages are now creating a deafening silence in the wake of the magnitude of horrors and loss of innocent life unfolding in Gaza,\"

It's working. There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline.\n\nDudum then shared a link to apply for a job at HIMS, an online pharmacy that also includes the HERS brand and offers products for erectile dysfunction, anxiety and skin treatments.\n\nCritics were quick to react to Dudum's message, with many social media users saying they will be cancelling their HIMS subscriptions and asking others to do the same.\n\nAndrew Dudum, who identifies as Palestinian-American, voiced support for the student protesters across US campuses on X\n\nConservative writer Ben Domenech wrote: 'If you support Israel, cancel your HIMS subscription s immediately. You can get similar products elsewhere for cheaper anyway.'\n\nJoe Lonsdale, co-founder of software company Palantir Technologies, also weighed in, saying 'Real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob, chanting anti-US and other woke Pablum, following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all yet being indignantly righteous, while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students.'\n\nMany pointed out that Dudum may be harming the interest of shareholders who may not agree with him, given that HIMS is a publicly-traded company.\n\nOthers shared screenshots of the cancelation of their subscription, with one X user writing as the reason: 'Your CEO supports Hamas.'\n\nDudum, who has said he has family in Gaza and the West Bank, founded HIMS in 2017.\n\nHe wrote a blog post in November calling for a ceasefire and lamenting that companies were still supporting Israel after its counterattack had already killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians.\n\n'Now, a month past the October 7th attack, we find ourselves in a world where Israel has killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians with over 4,000 innocent children in a military response that nearly all international experts decry as violations of international law and human rights,' Dudum wrote.\n\nAnd the messages of unequivocal support for Israel are still sitting on our corporate pages -- untouched nor updated.'\n\nIn the Medium post, Dudum described himself as 'a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland.'\n\nDudum's stand comes in contrast with other CEOs who have said they will not hire students participating in the pro-Palestine protests.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to HIMS for comment on this story.\n\nPolice have arrested nearly 2,200 people during pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses across the United States in recent weeks, sometimes using riot gear, tactical vehicles and flash-bang devices to clear tent encampments and occupied buildings.\n\nMore than 100 people were taken into custody during a Columbia crackdown, just a fraction of the total arrests stemming from recent campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nA tally by The Associated Press recorded at least 56 incidents of arrests at 43 different US colleges or universities since April 18. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.\n\nEarly Thursday, officers surged against a crowd of demonstrators at University of California, Los Angeles, ultimately taking at least 200 protesters into custody after hundreds defied orders to leave, some forming human chains as police fired flash-bangs to break up the crowds.\n\nPolice tore apart a fortified encampment's barricade of plywood, pallets, metal fences and dumpsters, then pulled down canopies and tents.\n\nLike at UCLA, tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across other campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century.\n\nIsrael has branded the protests anti-Semitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition.\n\nThe NYPD moved to clear Hamilton Hall in Columbia University on April 30\n\nA pro-Palestinian protestor is arrested at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, on April 29\n\nAlthough some protesters have been caught on camera making anti-Semitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday defended the right of students to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days.\n\nThe demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 with students calling for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there.\n\nIsrael launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on October 7 and took roughly 250 hostages in an attack on southern

He stated that companies like his will be \"eager\" to hire them, drawing a contrast to other executives who have suggested that involvement in such protests could hinder employability.\n\nIn his post on X (formerly Twitter), Dudum emphasized the importance of moral courage over a college degree, writing, \"If you're currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university's divestment from Israel, keep going.It's working.\" He further added, \"There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline,\" and included a link to the Hims careers page.\n\nDudum's post received a critical response from Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir Technologies and current founder and managing partner of 8VC, an early-stage venture capital firm. Lonsdale argued that \"Real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob, chanting anti-US and other woke pablum, following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all yet being indignantly righteous, while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students.\"\n\nIn recent days, students across numerous campuses in the United States have gathered or established encampments to protest against Israel's ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has now entered its seventh month. Demonstrators are urging President Joe Biden, who has voiced support for Israel's right to self-defense, to take stronger action to halt the violence in Gaza. They are also demanding that schools divest from companies backing Israel's government.\n\nSeveral institutions, including the prestigious Ivy League Columbia University in New York City, have responded to the protests by deploying police forces to suppress the demonstrations.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the Gaza health ministry on Friday, Israel's military offensive on Gaza, which began on Oct. 7, has resulted in the death of at least 34,622 Palestinians and the injury of 77,867 others.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

If you're currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university's divestment from Israel, keep going. It's working. There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline.\"\n\nDudum's post then linked to job openings at his men's telehealth company.\n\nThe Palestinian-American CEO's statement drew backlash in comments from Jordan Fried and many others. Fried wrote, \"Translation: $HIMS hires antisemites. If there was ever a sell signal, this is it.\" In the meantime, Jordan Schachtel added, \"Violation of fiduciary duty in support of Hamas. Bold move, Cotton.\"\n\nAs comments responding to Jordan Schachtel pointed out, Andrew Dudum's statement alone does not mean he supports Hamas, necessarily. \"Condemning the horrific actions of Israel is not the same as supporting Hamas,\" Kiwi Investor wrote in response to Schachtel's criticism.\n\nPerhaps clarifying his position on the conflict, Dudum also reposted a Senator Bernie Sanders interview with journalist Christiane Amanpour in which Sanders stated, referring to the campus protests,\n\n[The students] are out there for the right reasons... they are out there not because they are 'pro-Hamas.' They are out there because they are outraged by what the Israeli government is doing in Gaza.\"\n\nDudum, who says he descends from Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948 as well as Holocaust survivors, has spoken out in support of a ceasefire in the past. In 2007, he founded LendforPeace.org, an organization \"providing direct micro-loans to Palestinian women in the West Bank and Gaza,\" according to its website.\n\nFurthermore, in a Medium opinion piece published after Oct. 7, Dudum wrote that he believed in \"... [P]roactively dismantling the overly simplistic perspective that there are two sides to every issue and acknowledge that multiple truths do exist ... [I]n the case of Israel and Palestine, the difficulty is not in identifying those truths, but in holding multiple truths together, simultaneously,\" he added.\n\nIsrael says the Oct. 7 Hamas-lead attack inside Israel killed 1,200 hundred civilians, according to NPR. Israel then attacked Gaza, in what authorities said was an offensive against Hamas, but since then, Israeli forces have killed an estimated 30,000 Palestinians, many of whom were civilians.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_kennedy@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "William Kennedy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Homs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academic degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Amanpour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christiane Amanpour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nakba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536766", "eventUri": "eng-9536766", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 354, "textEnd": 359}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2120, "textEnd": 2126, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

It's working,\" he said.\n\nDudum then proclaimed, \"There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline,\" adding a link to the Hims & Hers job application page.\n\nNeedless to say, he was eviscerated in the comments -- but, worse still, his poorly thought-out PR move ended up tanking the company's stock.\n\nHis & Hers lost nearly $210 million in stock value in a single day Friday, according to the New York Post.\n\nTherefore, on Sunday, Dudum returned to X to try to stop the bleeding.\n\nIn the first post in his thread, he said he'd \"like to clarify a few things because my words have been misconstrued by some.\"\n\nNo, people understood exactly what he was trying to say -- and that was the whole problem.\n\nThat inconvenient fact notwithstanding, Dudum pressed on, saying, \"I, in no way condone nor support acts or threats of violence, antisemitism, or intimidation and there is absolutely no justification for violence on our campuses. ... I am deeply saddened that my support for peaceful protest has been interpreted by some as encouraging violence, intimidation, or bigotry of any kind.\"\n\nThey might have not involved gunfire or knives, but demonstrators have tussled with the police, beaten a young Jewish woman unconscious and shouted anti-Semitic slogans with such violence and venom that Jewish students have left campus in fear for their lives.\n\nFrom the start, Dudum came across as incredibly disingenuous, but he wasn't finished.\n\nThe Hims & Hers CEO said that \"the right for people to use their voices in peaceful protest to drive change ... is critical to our democracy and must be protected. Our world today is more just because students throughout history have courageously taken to their campuses and used their voices to force change.\"\n\nFurther, he said, as \"a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland, as I have previously shared, I have a personal appreciation for the different perspectives people have which I live with daily at my dinner table.\"\n\nDudum ended his thread by saying, \"I hope and pray for peace and for an end to violence everywhere.\"\n\nPhil Kerpen, president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, shared the original post and the \"apology\" with the caption, \"Evil Andy before his stock got crushed versus after.\"\n\nLet it not pass without mentioning that Dudum disabled the comments on his half-hearted \"apology.\"\n\nClearly, he only backpedaled because the stock of his company had fallen catastrophically.\n\nDudum just couldn't bring himself to denounce the anti-Semitism of the college protesters or even express remorse.\n\nHillary Clinton has delivered more convincing phony apologies than this.\n\nHis posts were a transparent attempt at damage control with no real reflection or contrition.\n\nIn other words, they were just what people have come to expect from woke CEOs who accidentally say the quiet part out loud.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allison_anton@westernjournal.com", "name": "Allison Anton", "type": "author",

immense $210 million in stock value that day, with signs pointing to a continuation of the trend.\n\nSo in one fell swoop, Hims and Hers has lost hundreds of millions in market value, lost significant public opinion and is now looking to hire a bunch of DEI employees.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that companies should stay out of political issues.\n\nA majority of U.S. adults don't believe that companies should take public stances on current events, according to Gallup.\n\nThere are exceptions, of course, as any American should want an American company to support their homeland, but outside of that, it's best to shut up and do business.\n\nIs putting out one little political message really worth costing your company millions?\n\nIf your answer is yes, you really shouldn't be in

He tweeted that he is \"eager\" to hire pro-Hamas protesters. He is Palestinian-American with family in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThis is his original tweet:\n\nLast November Dudum tweeted encouragement to \"leaders\" and CEOs to call for an immediate ceasefire. He pinned it to the top of his X page. It's still there.\n\nThe predictable happened after his latest tweet. He said on Sunday that his comments were \"misconstrued by some.\" Really? He was clear in what he said. He used the word 'genocide' which is a word that Hamas propagandists use. The only genocide that goes on is at the hands of Hamas, like the massacres conducted by the internationally recognized terrorist group in Israel on October 7, 2023.\n\nHims & Hers, which offers telehealth and online pharmacy services for erectile dysfunction, sexual performance, hair loss treatments, mental health and more, saw its stock slide by 8% Friday amid the controversy. Though it has rebounded by 0.89% in after-hours trading since Friday's close. The drop came as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 450 points, or more than a full percentage point.\n\nThe company's stock is up 16.8% year to date but down 4% from a year ago and has seen significant fluctuations in that period, posting single-day gains of about 11% in early November and 31% in late February on favorable earnings news. Its stock is up 14.9% since the company went public in September 2019.\n\nOh.\n\nDudum's opinions aren't so much political as they are anti-American. I say anti-American because the protesters chant \"Death to America\", along with \"Death to Israel.\" They do so on American soil. It's unacceptable. The protesters take down American flags and put up Palestinian flags. That, too, is unacceptable.\n\nDudum was criticized on social media.\n\nDudum's post sparked backlash from other business figures, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, who replied, \"Real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob, chanting anti-US and other woke pablum, following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all yet being indignantly righteous, while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students.\"\n\nConservative radio host Jason Rantz ripped Dudum's post and told followers on X, \"There are plenty of places to get what they sell that won't require you to support a company that embraces antisemitism.\"\n\nA competitor offered one month free for orders placed by Hims customers.\n\nProgressives just don't learn. It was completely predictable that Him would get the Bud Light treatment. Dudum is free to hire anyone he so chooses. He chose to do some kind of terrorist-appeasing virtue-signaling by publicly encouraging the protesters, telling them the protests were working, and then providing a link to apply for employment with his company.\n\nFor whom are the protests working? Fundraising for The Squad and their fellow travelers in the Democrat Party? The protesters are being infiltrated by professional agitators who are causing violence. Student protesters don't make foreign policy and they certainly don't make war policy for Netanyahu. Netanyahu is going into Rafah to clean out Hamas, as he said he would do.\n\nCEOs concerned about their company's bottom line should learn to read the room. A minority of college students are conducting these protests. They deny Jewish students and professors access to campus. It's graduation season. Parents are starting to get involved. This doesn't end well for companies who support antisemitism and riots.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_townsend@hotair.com",

Hims CEO Andrew Dudum Is Upset About Reaping What He Sowed", "body": "We all know the saying. 'Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.' It is also known as the FAFO game. Or, sometimes 'Sowing Season vs. Reaping Season.' No matter what phrase we use, it is a time-honored tradition on Twitter that some people will do or say something galactically dumb and then act shocked when the reality shows them that there are consequences for their words and actions.\n\nBut occasionally, the rest of us get rewarded with seeing the third phase of the game: trying to weasel their way out of it.\n\nHims founder and CEO Andrew Dudum has now entered Phase Three.\n\nTwitchy readers will recall Dudum (someone no one had heard of a couple of weeks ago) announcing on Twitter recently that 'moral courage beats a college degree.' In some ways, this is very true, given the fact that many colleges in America are simply high-priced daycare centers anymore. But the all-important context of Dudum's statement -- supporting the violent, antisemitic encampments on college campuses -- earned him the wrath not only of Twitter but also of the stock market. Hims lost more than $200 million in just two days.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to try to recover the stock of his company, Dudum took to Twitter last night with a thread trying to recover before trading opened on Monday morning:\n\n'... I am deeply saddened that my support for peaceful protest has been interpreted by some as encouraging violence, intimidation, or bigotry of any kind.'\n\n'Peaceful protest.' Uh-huh. It's looking more and more like his attorneys wrote this statement for him.\n\nThose students 'courageously' attacked, harassed, and intimidated Jewish students from walking freely on their own campuses and attending classes. But please continue.\n\n'I have Jewish friends' has entered the thread. It's like clockwork.\n\nOf course, we can measure Dudum's sincerity here by the fact that he turned off replies for his non-apology thread.\n\nWe're guessing there were some torches too. Maybe even tar and some goose feathers.\n\nDudum has never once condemned the terrorist attacks of October 7 or any of the other abominable things Hamas does.\n\nIt is his freedom not to, obviously, but it makes it pretty difficult to believe him now when he says, 'I, in no way condone nor support acts or threats of violence ...'\n\nIn this case, we don't even think he's worth a violin. Just a sad trombone.\n\nSaying it's everyone else's fault for 'misconstruing' is always the sign of a sincere apology, LOL.\n\nThat and calling out 'political divisiveness' when you are the one who caused the outrage. That part's straight out of the Obama/Biden playbook.\n\nWe can't say how the market will respond to Dudum and Hims today ... but we know how we HOPE it responds.\n\nWe ran this version through Google Translate. It checks out.\n\nHAHAHAHA.\n\nWho could have possibly seen it coming? Except for every sane person in the world, that is.\n\nYep. That and nothing more. It's amazing, though, that Dudum doesn't realize how obvious this is to everyone.\n\nThe thing is, Dudum's original tweet, the one that got him into this hot water, is still the pinned tweet at the top of his profile.\n\nNo, we don't think he's sorry at all. So, let the consequences continue.\n\nReaping season always lasts as long as it needs to last.\n\nHims will probably survive as a company. We're not yet convinced that Dudum will survive as its CEO.", "source": {"uri": "twitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twitchy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grateful_calvin@twitchy.com", "name": "Grateful Calvin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Homs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fafo_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fafo Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weasel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academic degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Translate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/tw/images/up/2024/104/249276d3-c3be-4a0f-a85c-851913ef49ac.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536766", "eventUri": "eng-9536766", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2047, "textEnd": 2056}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

After he made that comment, he was inundated with folks on X saying they would no longer be buying his products. Then on top of that, about two days after he said that his company's stock plummeted.\n\nThe online sexual health and pharmaceutical company plummet 8% on Friday from its opening price of $12.24 to $11.26 [....]\n\nThe market cap of the company opened at $2.62 billion and closed at $2.41 billion, and share price continued to slide in after-hours trading on Friday and Saturday.\n\nTrading volume was also more than double the average for the stock -- indicating that some shareholders were rushing to get out.\n\nAs a result of the drop, his company lost $210 million, according to the NY Post.\n\nNow, that just could be a message people are not on board with the actions of the radicals, if Dudum and others are listening. Many of the \"protesters\" have been arrested or suspended, and there has been violence including attacking the police as well as incidents of antisemitism, even chanting for Hamas or having terrorist flags.\n\nTurns out, Americans tend not to like such things. One of the groups behind the protests, Students for Justice in Palestine, has been sued by Oct. 7 victims, alleging that they are operating as a \"propaganda\" arm of Hamas.\n\nDudum's opinion was not in line with other CEOs, who have been vocal on the matter, such as Palantir CEO Alex Karp.\n\n\"We're gonna do an exchange program sponsored by Karp.

It's working.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline,\" he added.\n\nThe post, which boasted only 5,000 likes despite nearly two million views as of Saturday morning, included a link to an application page.\n\nThe leftist CEO faced so much backlash for the social media post that he set it so that only people whom he'd mentioned (nobody) could directly reply.\n\nThat didn't stop hordes of disgusted, patriotic, pro-Israel Americans from tweeting at him anyway.\n\nBelow is just a tiny sample of the abundant response:\n\nIt isn't just voices of displeasure that Dudum now faces. He's also facing a huge drop in the value of his company.\n\nHims & Hers lost $210 million in value Friday when the company's stock plummeted from $12.24 a share to $11.26.\n\nIn fairness, the stock has been trending down since late March. But on the other hand, the latest drop was quite quick and steep.\n\nBut there's more.\n\n\"[The] share price continued to slide in after-hours trading on Friday and Saturday,\" according to the New York Post.\n\nAnd the \"[t]rading volume was also more than double the average for the stock -- indicating that some shareholders were rushing to get out.\"\n\nAs for Dudum, why is he so partial to the anti-Israel protesters? Likely because he has family in both Gaza and the West Bank and is himself reportedly a Palestinian-American.\n\nThat said, most CEOs do not share his perspective. Take Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who this week said that the protesters should be shipped off to North Korea.\n\n\"We're gonna do an exchange program sponsored by Karp,\" he said while speaking at a forum Wednesday. \"A couple months in North Korea, nice-tasting flavored bark. See how you feel about that.\"\n\nAccording to Business Insider, he also accused the protesters of following a pagan religion.\n\n\"Look at Columbia,\" he said. \"There is literally no way to explain the investment in our elite schools, and the output is a pagan religion -- a pagan religion of mediocrity and discrimination and intolerance, and violence.\"\n\nHe added that there's a \"double standard\" where protesters willingly dedicate themselves to \"an architecture of antidiscrimination while dressing in masks and excluding the population that's been most discriminated for the last 3,000 years.\"\n\nThen there's Pershing Square Capital Management exec Bill Ackman, who, besides being the first to declare that he won't hire Harvard students who signed an anti-Israel letter, has been donating money to bless pro-Israel counter-protesters.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

If you're currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people & for your university's divestment from Israel, keep going. It's working. There are plenty of companies & CEOs eager to hire you, regardless of university discipline.\"\n\nHe then included a link to the Hims & Hers recruitment page on the firm's website.\n\nTo understand just how spectacularly dumb Dudum's post was, it's important to recall exactly what had happened in the 48 hours leading up to it.\n\nThat was the period in which Columbia University's student protestors, aided by outside professional agitators, smashed their way into the historic Hamilton Hall, barricading the doors, and brandishing banners saying 'INTIFADA!' lest there be any doubt as to their violent intent.\n\nThis came after they'd spent two weeks harassing and abusing Jewish students, and stopped them being given on-campus lectures, and after the same mob had been seen and heard regularly chanting that Hamas sing-along favorite \"From the river to the sea,\" which infers the eradication of Israel, the terror group's declared mission.\n\nEventually, NYPD riot cops moved in on Tuesday night to arrest them, which they did with commendably ruthless efficiency.\n\nAnd it was after witnessing all this that Andrew Dudum decided to tell the world what he thought about it and take sides in such a stunningly partisan way that it led to many of his customers venting their fury and his firm's valuation self-imploding by $200 million.\n\nToday, of course, he did what all virtue-signaling corporate imbeciles do when they suddenly discover their customer base doesn't share their woke bulls-t - he melted like an ice cream in a heatwave.\n\nIn a self-pitying non-apology of a thread on X, Dudum walked back his previous comments, insisting he doesn't condone or support violence, antisemitism or intimidation, even though that was exactly what he'd done.\n\nThen, of course, he blamed everyone else for supposedly misconstruing his very unambiguous comments.\n\n\"The last few days have been a disheartening reflection of just how divisive a time we live in,\" he whined. \"I am deeply saddened that my support for peaceful protest has been interpreted by some as encouraging violence, intimidation, or bigotry of any kind.\"\n\nThen, of course, he played the victim card: \"As a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948, and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland, I have a personal appreciation for the different perspectives people have which I live with daily at my dinner table. I hope and pray for peace and for an end to violence everywhere.'\n\nWhen I read these words, I wondered what this great peace-loving moral crusader had posted after the horrendous Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, in which 1,200 people were brutally murdered and 240 more kidnapped -- including Holocaust survivors and babies?\n\nIn fact, Dudum's first post after the atrocity came three weeks later on Oct. 27 when he retweeted an Amnesty International statement that read: \"CEASEFIRE NOW! CEASEFIRE NOW! CEASEFIRE NOW! CEASEFIRE NOW! In the face of unfettered devastation and suffering, humanity must prevail. Demand a ceasefire by all parties to end civilian suffering.\"\n\nHe clearly felt no such similar compulsion for humanity to prevail when it was mere Israeli lives being shot, bombed, raped and decapitated.\n\nIs that the kind of moral courage that Dudum likes to preach about?\n\nNo, it's stinking, two-faced moral bankruptcy.\n\nIt denotes a man who doesn't actually care about peace, or an end to violence, if it's a terrorist organization like Hamas waging an actual publicly stated genocide against Israel and Jews.\n\nHe only cares if it's his side that is getting killed by way of retaliation.\n\nThen he's quite happy to reward protesting students who demand an Intifada - the last one was notable for Palestinian suicide bombers murdering Israelis -- with a job.\n\nHims & Hers started up in 2017 by selling erectile dysfunction medication.\n\nIronically, thanks to its flaccid-brained CEO, it's now suffered public opprobrium and the biggest stock price drop in its seven-year history.\n\nAnd hypocrite Dudum couldn't get me up to buy his products if he paid me $200 million.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

Domenech urged supporters of Israel to cancel their HIMS subscriptions, highlighting cheaper alternatives, while Lonsdale criticized Dudum's approach to moral courage, which he felt involved joining a \"mindless mob.\"", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homs"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Homs"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Domenech", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Domenech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/595134", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536766", "eventUri": "eng-9536766", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 225035374, "title": "Mpox warning triggered after local transmission detected in Australia", "text": "SYDNEY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Local authorities in the Australian state of Victoria have issued a public warning over monkeypox, also known as mpox, since the infectious disease was found locally transmitted. According to the alert issued on Tuesday, Victoria has seen 16 confirmed cases of mpox since April 18, 13 of which were locally acquired. Before that, the most recent cases were reported in January. \"Although mpox has generally been declining worldwide, new cases continue to be reported in many countries,\" Victoria's Chief Health Officer Clare Looker said in a statement. \"The majority of cases reported globally in March 2024 were in African, European, Western Pacific, and Southeast Asian regions, and the Americas. These trends and recent local cases indicate there is an ongoing risk of mpox in Victoria from both local and overseas transmission,\" the officer added. The Victorian Department of Health warned that mpox usually results in a mild illness, with symptoms likely to develop up to 21 days after being exposed to the virus. Although most people can recover within a few weeks, some may suffer severe illness and require hospitalization. While the current outbreak has predominantly impacted men, the health authority urged anyone who has been in close contact with those infected to remain cautious.", "summary": "<p>SYDNEY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Local authorities in the Australian state of Victoria have issued a public warning over monkeypox, also known as mpox, since the infectious disease was found locally transmitted.</p><p> According to the alert issued on Tuesday, Victoria has seen 16 confirmed cases of mpox since April 18, 13 of which were locally acquired.

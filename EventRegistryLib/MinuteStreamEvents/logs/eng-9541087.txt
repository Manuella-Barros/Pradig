While Asia and the Middle East are rapidly building their production capabilities, Europe is focusing on connectivity to ensure it can transport hydrogen across borders. Hydrogen is seen as key to achieving a green transition as, unlike many other renewable energy sources, it is considered a versatile carrier that can be used as a fuel to power transport and other hard-to-abate industries. Decarbonising aviation, freight transport and industries such as manufacturing will depend heavily on regional green hydrogen production, which has encouraged both heavy public and private investment into the sector in recent years to accelerate production and spur technological innovation.\n\nMost of the hydrogen produced globally is derived from fossil fuels, with green hydrogen contributing less than one percent of global production at present. However, in line with climate pledges and aims for a green transition, several state governments have introduced green hydrogen policies and funding support to develop widescale green hydrogen projects in the coming decades. There is a global green hydrogen capacity of around 180 kT at present, with 14,000 kT more expected to be completed by 2030. There is a significantly larger global project pipeline that could be deployed pending investment and permitting. At present, China is by far the biggest consumer and producer of hydrogen.\n\nThe countries with the most ambitious green hydrogen production pipeline include China, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Vietnam, Australia, Oman, France, and Canada. In 2023, China had 1060.9 kilotonnes of electrolysis-based hydrogen capacity in the final stages of development. While the second biggest green hydrogen power, Saudi Arabia, had 339 kT, followed by Sweden with 230.8 kT, demonstrating China's dominance of the sector. Saudi Arabia is currently constructing the world's biggest green hydrogen project to date, a facility that is expected to include ?up to 4 GW of solar and wind energy to produce up to 600 tonnes of green hydrogen per day, or up to 200 GW of green hydrogen every year.\n\nThe European Union aims to produce 10 million tonnes and import a further 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, which it will use to power transport and decarbonise industry. Germany has big plans for a future in green hydrogen, with almost $14.2 billion in state funding earmarked for the development of around two dozen hydrogen projects. Meanwhile, Sweden opened its largest electrolyser facility last year, with more expected to follow. In the U.K., the government believes \"low carbon hydrogen has a critical role to play in [its] transition to net zero.\" The U.K. plans to develop 5 GW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030, equivalent to the amount of gas consumed by over 3 million households annually.\n\nIn the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, several states are developing their green hydrogen capacity, supported by state and private funding. This month, in Oman, the state-owned group overseeing green hydrogen development, Hydrom, surpassed its annual funding aims with the signing of two new projects in Dhofar worth $11 billion. Oman's total green hydrogen production is now expected to reach 1.38 million tonnes per year (mtpa) by 2030. The second round of green hydrogen auctions by Hydrom attracted more than 200 companies looking to invest in the sector in Oman.\n\nMeanwhile, in March, the Moroccan government stated that it would be allocating one million hectares to green hydrogen projects, with 300,000 hectares designated for the first phase of development. This is expected to attract greater private investment in the sector. The Prime Minister of Morocco said he expected to help the North African country \"play a major role in the field of energy transition globally.\" Over 100 investors have already shown interest in producing green hydrogen in Morocco, encouraged by the country's favourable conditions for solar and wind energy production.\n\nIn Asia, China is rapidly developing its green hydrogen capacity, with an estimated installed capacity of 1.2 GW at the end of 2023. The Hydrogen Council and McKinsey predict that China will be the biggest single market for clean hydrogen by the mid-century, transporting most of its supplies via pipeline for domestic use. Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the government launched its national hydrogen development strategy in February. Vietnam aims to produce between 100,000 MT and 500,000 MT a year of hydrogen, derived from renewable energy and carbon capture by the end of the decade. This is expected to increase to between 10 million MT and 20 million MT a year by 2050.\n\nIn most regions of the world, green hydrogen is in the nascent stage of development. However, several countries have significant green hydrogen production pipelines, which they hope to develop over the next decade. This is expected to support the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate industries such as transport and heavy industry. While China will no doubt remain the biggest green hydrogen producer, several other countries are developing green hydrogen strategies to support regional development to reduce their reliance on foreign powers for their renewable fuel supply.", "source": {"uri": "oilprice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OilPrice.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But the significance of this clean energy technology extends beyond the immediate environmental impact.\n\nIf production costs can be halved by 2030, green hydrogen could emerge as a fuel of the future. Its ease of storage also allows for flexible usage. Beyond its environmental benefits, green hydrogen fosters energy independence by reducing reliance on finite fossil fuels and mitigating supply fluctuations. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the green sector employed 11 million people in 2018, with projections of over 42 million jobs by 2050, highlighting its potential to create new industries and jobs.\n\nIndustries as drivers of future demand\n\nIn India, the push towards green hydrogen is increasingly driven by its vast industrial sector, with significant implications for both domestic utility and international trade. Industries such as steel and fertilizer production are pivotal, as these sectors are under pressure to reduce carbon emissions and enhance sustainability through innovative technologies like green hydrogen.\n\nRecognizing this, Indian companies are not only planning to use green hydrogen to meet their own energy needs but are also looking to export it, primarily in the form of green ammonia. This derivative, easier to transport than gaseous hydrogen, offers a practical solution for long-distance energy trade.\n\nThe strategic location of hydrogen production facilities along India's coastline -- in states like Odisha, Maharashtra, and Gujarat -- facilitates this export-oriented approach. These facilities are advantageously near port infrastructure, simplifying the logistics of international trade while serving sizable domestic markets within the same geographic regions. This dual focus supports India's broader energy independence goals and integrates with global hydrogen supply chains.\n\nTechnological partnerships and global collaboration: Expanding capabilities\n\nTo surmount the inherent technological challenges and scale production, India is proactively forging international partnerships. Collaborations with tech leaders from Japan, Europe, and Australia are pivotal, as these regions lead in hydrogen technology. These partnerships are not just about importing technology but are geared towards creating long-term relationships that will evolve with technological advancements and shifting market needs. This strategy ensures that Indian projects remain at the cutting edge of hydrogen technology and can quickly adapt to new efficiencies and methods as they arise.\n\nSuch international cooperation extends beyond technology transfer. It involves collaborative efforts in research and development, policy formulation, and even environmental management, making it a comprehensive approach to tackling the multifaceted challenges of green hydrogen production. Indian companies are increasingly seeking funding bundled with techology transfer for their projects from partners overseas, experts say.\n\nGreen hydrogen initiatives\n\nThe Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), under the Union Ministry of Power, has been appointed as the nodal authority for accrediting agencies responsible for monitoring, verifying, and certifying green hydrogen projects. This institutional support has paved the way for several significant initiatives across the country.\n\nOil India Limited (OIL) recently commissioned India's first 99% pure green hydrogen plant in Jorhat, Assam, marking a milestone in the nation's green energy journey. NTPC has also initiated green hydrogen blending operations in Surat's Piped Natural Gas (PNG) network, receiving approval for a 5% blending from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, with plans to scale up to 20%.\n\nPune Municipal Corporation has partnered with The Green Billions (TGBL) to convert waste into green hydrogen, demonstrating the potential for waste-to-energy projects. Additionally, the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) aims to mobilize financing and expedite green energy development. In September 2023, the Union Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas launched India's inaugural Green Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus in New Delhi, showcasing green hydrogen's applications in the transportation sector.\n\nThe government has launched several initiatives to support green hydrogen production. The Global Biofuel Alliance seeks to establish global standards for hydrogen from biomass, while the National Hydrogen Mission aims to increase production to 5 million metric tonnes by 2030, meeting 40% of domestic demand. A INR 15,000-crore Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has been proposed for electrolysers, and the Green Hydrogen Mission targets the development of at least 5 million metric tonnes of green hydrogen per annum, along with a renewable energy capacity addition of 125 GW by 2030. The Strategic Hydrogen Innovation Partnership (SHIP) facilitates R&D for green hydrogen production.\n\nChallenges in scaling production\n\nHowever, the path to ramping up green hydrogen production is fraught with challenges. The global manufacturing capacity for electrolyzers, a critical component in hydrogen production, stands at only 8 GW/year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). For India to meet its 2030 target, it would require a monumental increase to between 60-100 GW of electrolyzer capacity, nearly 12 times the current global output.\n\nResource scarcity poses another significant barrier. The production of hydrogen is mineral-intensive, relying on elements like nickel, platinum, and rare earth metals, which are in limited supply in India. This scarcity is compounded by insufficient domestic processing capabilities, which could stymie the scaling of electrolyzer manufacturing.\n\nEnergy requirements\n\nProducing green hydrogen is energy-intensive. An efficient system would need about 39 kWh of electricity to produce one kg of hydrogen, though operational efficiencies typically increase this demand to about 48 kWh per kg. With India's current renewable energy capacity at 125 GW, and ambitions to expand this to 500 GW, significant investments will be necessary to meet both existing and future energy needs.\n\nThe country also faces infrastructural challenges, including the need for improved transmission capacity to facilitate the cross-border exchange of power, which is crucial for the distribution of renewable energy across states.\n\nEnvironmental impacts and economic viability\n\nThe environmental impact of scaling up hydrogen production, particularly concerning water use, poses yet another challenge. Hydrogen production is water-intensive, and with many regions in India already facing severe water stress, the additional demand could exacerbate existing conditions. Addressing this requires careful planning and possibly the integration of technologies like desalination, which themselves require significant energy and infrastructure investments.\n\nEconomically, while the potential cost reductions in hydrogen production could make it competitive with traditional energy sources, achieving these reductions depends on technological advancements and the successful implementation of policy measures. The economic viability of green hydrogen also hinges on creating market structures that support its adoption across various sectors, from industrial applications to transportation.\n\nFuture prospects and strategic directions\n\nLooking forward, India's approach to integrating green hydrogen into its energy system is multi-faceted. It involves not only enhancing production capabilities and building out infrastructure but also establishing robust regulatory frameworks and market incentives to encourage adoption. By aligning these elements, India can effectively transition to a low-carbon economy, reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and positioning itself as a leader in the emerging global hydrogen economy.\n\nThe road ahead is complex and filled with challenges, but with strategic investments, international partnerships, and a clear focus on sustainability and economic viability, India's green hydrogen venture holds promising potential for energy transformation, both domestically and globally.", "source": {"uri": "auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now, an innovative project has solved this problem, bringing emissions to zero.\n\nHydrogen has long been considered the cornerstone of the industry's quest for a more sustainable future. Although it is not found in its pure state in nature, its potential as a renewable fuel is immense. The key lies in electrolysis, a process that harnesses electricity generated from renewable sources.\n\nAlthough the viability of green hydrogen has raised some doubts, it is anticipated that the increased availability of renewable energy will reduce the costs of its production. According to the International Energy Agency, this method of obtaining green hydrogen could avoid the emission of 830 million tons of CO2 per year.\n\nThe complete transition to gray hydrogen would require approximately 3,000 TWh of additional energy per year, equivalent to Europe's current electricity demand. Despite concerns about the high costs associated with green hydrogen production, these are expected to decrease as decarbonization proceeds.\n\nThe optimal way to produce hydrogen would be by electrolysis of water, breaking down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. However, this process is often expensive and requires large amounts of electrical energy, which in many cases is not obtained from renewable sources.\n\nSaudi Arabia has unveiled an ambitious project that could revolutionize global hydrogen production. Construction of a $5 billion green hydrogen plant in the city of Neom is scheduled to begin this month and is expected to be operational by 2026.\n\nLed by NEOM Green Hydrogen Company (NGHC), this plant will become the largest in the world, with the capacity to produce up to 600 tons of hydrogen per day, without generating carbon emissions. They have recently received a large shipment of wind turbines.\n\nAccording to project managers, this plant represents a crucial milestone for the integration of solar and wind energy into the project. Running exclusively on renewable energy, the plant positions itself as a leader in the energy transition, supporting Saudi Arabia's vision of becoming a leading hydrogen exporter.\n\nThe main problem (and what does not convince experts) is the fact that hydrogen and oil cannot coexist as a method of export. The key is the potential that both have to enrich a country like Saudi Arabia, but only one of them is renewable.\n\nLikewise, The Line's futuristic city project, along with Neom, is intended to be the definitive push for hydrogen (especially white and green or blue), while in the West we are still trying to understand that other colors, such as red or purple, are not a good option. Especially in countries like Japan and also in the European Union, where the dreaded nuclear energy is being brought back in what seems to us to be a serious mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, there is also the challenge of transporting hydrogen from the Arabian Peninsula to the rest of the world, something that could only be done by ship (in powder form, a method similar to the one Australia wants to implement) or through the pipelines that the country has with the rest of the Asian continent. It also remains to be seen whether they will be able to generate it in massive quantities to decarbonize their transport, another of the Arab country's proposals.\n\nMore than a technological breakthrough, this project reflects a firm commitment to sustainable development, with an exclusive agreement for the worldwide export of green ammonia derived from the hydrogen produced. This approach is in line with recent developments in the United Arab Emirates during the COP, demonstrating a clear orientation towards a more sustainable future.", "source": {"uri": "ecoticias.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ECOticias.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neom"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis of water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Molecule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabian Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEOM-220523-a-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541087", "eventUri": "eng-9541087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

His company provides consulting services in the fields of decarbonisation, green hydrogen and ammonia, renewable energy, and transport electrification. As a thought leader, Crolius focuses on sustainable and low-carbon fuel sources, such as green hydrogen and ammonia, renewable energy, and clean transportation. In an exclusive interview with Muscat Daily, Crolius shared his insights and views on the role of green hydrogen in the global energy transition and Oman's leading position and potential on the global green hydrogen map.\n\nHow significant is the role of green hydrogen and ammonia in the global transition towards sustainable energy sources? In your view, what makes green hydrogen and ammonia more attractive as sustainable fuels compared to other alternatives?\n\nGreen hydrogen and ammonia have highly significant roles to play in the energy transition. Since the advent of the Industrial Revolution, fossil fuels have been the major form of primary energy employed by human society. With the shift away from fossil fuels necessitated by the climate crisis, it is necessary to turn to the sun as a major form of primary energy. The most practical methods of turning sunlight into usable energy - photovoltaics, wind, and biomass - all involve conversion of primary energy into electricity. Electricity is a valuable and versatile form of energy, but it is limited in the degree to which it can be stored on a massive scale and transported over great distances.\n\nConverting electricity into energy-rich chemicals allows both of these limitations to be overcome. The simplest form of conversion involves extracting hydrogen from water. Molecular hydrogen, however, brings its own set of storage and transportation challenges. One method of overcoming these challenges is to convert hydrogen into simple derivative molecules such as methane or methanol. Ammonia is an especially attractive derivative molecule because it does not contain any carbon atoms, and therefore does not produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct of any downstream energy extraction process. It is also the case that hydrogen derivatives can often meet the need in other settings where a fuel must be used rather than electricity, such as certain transportation applications and industrial processes.\n\nWhat challenges do producers globally currently face in scaling up the production and distribution of green hydrogen?\n\nThe primary challenge for green hydrogen producers comes from competitive economics. It is not yet clear where the green hydrogen production costs will eventually settle vs. those of legacy energy commodities such as natural gas. What is clear is that the first generation of green hydrogen plants and related infrastructure will yield product costs that are higher than those of its legacy competitors. This means that green hydrogen producers must build investment cases that rely on non-traditional elements, such as carbon taxes, government subsidies and incentives, and voluntary procurement programmes of customer companies. Country-by-country and bloc-by-bloc, progress is being made, but only as a result of the great creativity and commitment of green hydrogen players.\n\nWhat do you say about Oman's ambitious plans to develop large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia projects? What lessons can Oman learn from existing producers to become a more competitive producer of green hydrogen and ammonia?\n\nOman is already positioning itself as a serious player in emerging global markets for green hydrogen and ammonia. The hydrogen space within the energy transition is at a very early stage of development, with the first large-scale production facilities just reaching final investment decisions. The opportunity for Oman, therefore, is not to learn from existing producers, but rather to learn with them.\n\nTwo examples from Oman's current portfolio of hydrogen projects are representative of the country's activities in this regard. The first is the Amnah Consortium's decision, announced in January, to devote the hydrogen that will be produced at its planned installation in Duqm to the in-country production of green steel. The second is an announcement made in March of Hydrom's MOU with Germany's VNG that will focus on development of a green fuel value chain between Oman and Germany. In both cases, Omani companies will participate in the projects as partners, and in so doing will position themselves on the cutting edge of global clean energy development.\n\nTo what extent can the planned green hydrogen projects in the Gulf countries contribute to the global push for sustainable energy?\n\nSeveral countries in the Gulf region and broader Middle East - notably Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt, in addition to Oman - are unquestionably among the global leaders in the push for sustainable energy. The common denominators across these countries are an abundance of renewable energy resources; favorable geographic placement for servicing of markets in Europe and Asia; and extensive experience with large-scale development of energy infrastructure.\n\nWhat potential does green hydrogen hold for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, such as transportation, heavy industry, and power generation?\n\nThe common theme running through the hard-to-abate sectors is the need for energy and/or material inputs that take forms other than electricity. In the transportation cases, the need is for chemical fuels that allow large quantities of energy to be stored at high volumetric and gravimetric densities.\n\nIn the case of industrial and chemical processes, the need is often for substances that embody both energy and specific chemical properties that allow them to react with other molecules. Hydrogen and its derivatives perform very well on both of these dimensions, bringing both high energy density and desirable forms of chemical reactivity.\n\nOne other consideration that informs the potential that green hydrogen and its derivatives hold for the hard-to-abate sectors is that there are no other ready alternatives that can fill the needed functions. Hydrogen's essential properties including its abundance, chemical reactivity, and susceptibility to simple, inexpensive production put it in a class by itself among the Earth's chemical elements.\n\nWhat are your views on the potential of green hydrogen as a maritime fuel, particularly in light of Oman's strategic location and maritime transport links?\n\nHydrogen itself is likely to have a limited role in the maritime sector because it is difficult to store. It can be stored as a gas, but even at high levels of compression, its very low energy density does not fit the needs of energy-hungry vessel propulsion. It can also be liquefied, but the extreme cryogenics involved in reaching the temperature of liquefaction themselves involve parasitic consumption of large amounts of energy.\n\nHydrogen also embodies safety hazards that can be managed, but at the cost of added ship-board complexity. These challenges with hydrogen in its elemental form create an opening in the maritime sector for methanol and ammonia. Both fuels have properties that are close enough to those of current maritime fuels that ships can be deployed with fuels systems and engines that are only modestly different from those in use today.\n\nOman is well-positioned to participate in the emerging maritime green fuel economy, for example by investing in ammonia bunkering facilities in the Sohar Port and Freezone.", "source":

I support the Biden administration's goal to produce hydrogen in a way that prioritizes sustainability, however 45V, in its current form, is a straitjacket on the industry and works against the Biden administration's own climate goals.\"\n\nThe 45V tax credit, also known as the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, is a tax credit for the production of clean hydrogen. It is among the credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act, and provides a credit of up to $3 per kilogram of clean hydrogen produced. The payout is based on carbon intensity, with the lower the greenhouse gas emissions associated with production, the higher the credit.\n\nSome hydrogen producers have warned that implementation of 45V could be derailed by counterproductive rulemaking. They note that while 45V is technology-neutral, rules from the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would preclude some methods of hydrogen production from qualifying for the credit. Treasury and IRS established \"three pillars\" around qualifications for 45V -- deliverability, temporal matching, and incrementality requirements -- which some producers argue go beyond the intent of the original law.\n\nThe guidance proposes that producers would need to show that electricity generation is time-matched to the period during which the electrolyzer is operating. The time-matching would begin on an annual basis, then move to an hourly basis as tracking systems improve. The guidance also says power for the electrolyzer must be coming from the same grid region, and be incremental to existing generation resources. Forrest and other hydrogen production groups argue those are among the requirements that would raise production costs.\n\nShelley Moore Capito, a Republican U.S. Senator from West Virginia, earlier in a statement said, \"The 45V credit is technology neutral and accessible to project sponsors regardless of their particular hydrogen production pathway as long as they meet certain carbon emissivity requirements.\" Capito, ranking member of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, noted, though, that \"the requirements of the IRS guidance preclude certain means of hydrogen production from qualifying for the credit.\" Capito's office in a statement said one hydrogen source that would not receive the credit under that guidance would be blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas and paired with carbon capture technology.\n\nMany of the U.S. hydrogen hubs being established by a $7 billion investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act rely natural gas to produce hydrogen. Forrest has said his company would likely reduce its U.S. investment strategy if the 45V structure is not changed.\n\nFortescue, meanwhile, is working on several major projects outside the U.S., including a green hydrogen and ammonia production project in Oman.\n\nHydrogen Oman SPC, known as Hydrom, on April 29 awarded rights to develop a manufacturing facility to Actis and Fortescue. The companies were announced as the winning bidders in the second round of a green hydrogen tender process.\n\nHydrom is an independent entity founded by the Omani government to manage that country's green hydrogen strategy. Officials at a signing ceremony last week in Muscat, the capital of Oman, said the project could produce as much as 200,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually from the use of 4.5 GW of wind and solar power generation capacity.\n\nOfficials from London, UK-based Actis said the new plant is part of the company's $4.7 billion Actis Energy 5 fund, which is supporting several energy projects. Actis in a news release said the hydrogen from the project is expected to be sold to local industrial groups, and processed into derivatives -- including ammonia -- for export.\n\nHE Eng Salim bin Nasser Al Aufi, minister of Energy and Minerals and chairman of Hydrom, said: \"Oman is strategically located between two key green hydrogen demand centers in Europe and Asia. This, in addition to, our tier-1 infrastructure and logistics capabilities have enabled us to leverage our first mover advantage in the global hydrogen industry. The availability of renewable natural resources in Oman coupled with the country's favorable geopolitical positioning, investor-friendly policies and progressive energy transition strategies make it one of the most suitable countries for green hydrogen production. I would like to congratulate Actis and Fortescue on their awarding and look forward to working together to realize our collective vision.\"\n\nActis has about 21 GW of renewable energy generation capacity either in operation or under construction. Fortescue has a pipeline of projects worldwide, including in the U.S. Both companies have said they are committed to helping move the world away from fossil fuels, and support the decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries.\n\nMoataz Kandil, MENA (Middle East and North Africa) president at Fortescue, said, \"Actis and Fortescue are completely in sync with our ambitions to decarbonize and create a new green energy industry globally. We share a common vision for the pivotal role that green hydrogen and green ammonia will play in forging a sustainable future. Oman not only has great natural resources, but it is also in an ideal location for export and has set up the structures and regulations needed to help enable this industry to flourish. This strategic partnership between Hydrom, Actis and Fortescue will not only help to drive the development of a large-scale green hydrogen project in Oman, but will lead the way for others around the world to follow, cementing Oman as a powerhouse in green molecules.\"", "source": {"uri": "powermag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POWER Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But there are big questions over whether this is a workable solution.\n\nHere are five challenges facing hydrogen-powered aviation.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nHydrogen can be very clean or very dirty -- it all depends on how it's produced.\n\nMost hydrogen on the market today is so-called gray hydrogen, made by splitting natural gas -- which emits a lot of CO2. Blue hydrogen captures those greenhouse gases, but it costs more and there are worries about where to store CO2. The rarest, and most expensive, is green hydrogen, made by using renewable power to split water.\n\n\"Hydrogen planes will only be as sustainable as the energy that powers them,\" said Carlos L\u00f3pez de la Osa, aviation manager with green group Transport & Environment (T&E).\n\n\"Most hydrogen for transportation is not zero emission today. It's not green hydrogen,\" said Val Miftakhov, CEO of ZeroAvia, a British-American manufacturer that aims to deliver its first hydrogen-electric aircraft with 40 to 80 seats by 2027.\n\nHydrogen is the lightest element, but it has a much lower energy density than kerosene, meaning aircraft powered by it instead of fossil fuels would actually weigh more.\n\nIt can be burned with oxygen to create water, powering a jet, but it has to be stored in liquid form, which means installing high-pressure tanks that keep the highly flammable substance at temperatures below minus 253 Celsius. All that adds weight, cutting into range, cargo and passenger capacity.\n\nHydrogen can also be used to power a fuel cell, generating electricity to turn a propeller.\n\nAccording to a 2022 McKinsey study, \"with current aircraft designs, hydrogen aircraft could be range limited to up to 2,500 kilometers,\" which is the distance between London and Istanbul. Only \"redesigning airframes and storage technology might unlock longer ranges without reducing the number of available seats.\"\n\nDestination 2050 -- the European aviation alliance for creating net-zero air transport by midcentury, which brings together airlines, airports, manufacturers and navigation service providers -- predicts that hydrogen-powered aircraft will be available by 2035, but only \"suitable for short-range intra-European routes.\"\n\nThat means they can't be used for long-haul flights which Eurocontrol, the European air traffic management body, says are responsible for more than 50 percent of aviation's CO2 emissions.\n\nToday's airports have been set up to refuel airplanes with fossil fuels; they'd have to be revamped to supply hydrogen instead.\n\n\"There's no hydrogen at the airports today,\" said Miftakhov. He's convinced the solution will be to \"make hydrogen on site, at the airports,\" which will reduce transport costs.\n\nIn January, the California Energy Commission, the state's energy policy agency, awarded close to $3.3 million to ZeroAvia to develop a mobile liquid-hydrogen refueling truck that will refuel planes alongside kerosene at the Livermore Municipal Airport.\n\nHowever, the scale of the challenge is daunting.\n\n\"We don't know the full potential of hydrogen in aviation yet, and there are still significant challenges on the road to make it not only technically but also economically feasible,\" said Francisco Jos\u00e9 Lucas, head of sustainable aviation at the Spanish energy multinational Repsol, referring to the difficulties of getting hydrogen to airports. \"Nonetheless, we are sure that it is a technology with great potential in the medium and long term.\"\n\nAviation arguably has the toughest safety standards of any industry on the planet. That means switching to hydrogen will face very high regulatory hurdles.\n\n\"For aircraft with less than 20 passengers, the rules are performance based, and therefore would not require any adaptation\" to hydrogen propulsion, said Janet Northcote, spokesperson for the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).\n\nBut, \"for larger transport aircraft, the regulations are more prescriptive and these would not be appropriate for all aspects in their current form,\" she said.\n\nThe agency does have something called a Special Condition, which allows for novel technologies and has been used for the Airbus A321XLR -- an extra-long range airplane still awaiting certification.\n\nBut in the case of the XLR, that Special Condition applies to a new design for a central fuel tank, not for a novel way of powering flight.\n\nNorthcote said EASA is in touch with hydrogen plane developers through the agency's pre-application services.\n\n\"The pre-application process helps them de-risk their projects and allows us to identify where current regulations may need to evolve,\" she said.\n\nAfter all the effort to convert airplanes from kerosene to hydrogen, even such green machines could still have a negative climate impact.\n\nRecent studies show that about 50 percent to 75 percent of aviation's climate impact is caused by non-CO2 effects -- such as nitrogen oxide emissions or water vapor -- that contribute to the formation of contrails. These white clouds left in the sky by aircraft may add to climate change if they persist long enough.\n\n\"There are still doubts about the climate impact of hydrogen aviation,\" said Matteo Mirolo, a sustainable aviation expert at Breakthrough Energy, an organization founded by Bill Gates that is also investing in developing hydrogen aircraft.\n\n\"We still don't know exactly the non-CO2 impact of hydrogen,\" said Mirolo, adding that hydrogen-powered aircraft would, however, have \"a positive impact, reducing pollution levels compared to fossil kerosene-powered aircraft, including particulate matter.\"\n\nT&E's L\u00f3pez de la Osa argues that cleaner-burning hydrogen engines mean contrails are likely to be short-lived. \"Hydrogen combustion emits fewer particles where water vapor can attach,\" he said.\n\nTo test that, Airbus is running a head-to-head comparison in Nevada by flying similar hydrogen and kerosene airplanes.\n\nThe aim is to \"generate data to understand the differences, via flight testing in environments where contrails would form,\" said Glenn Llewellyn, vice president of Airbus' zero-emissions aircraft program.

Air Products, leveraging its distribution infrastructure and the collaboration with Sasol in providing the dispensing technology, facilitated and enabled the fuelling of the fuel cell electric vehicle to take passengers around a test track.\n\nGina emphasises that developing the country's hydrogen mobility ecosystem will require such partnerships. \"There is a need to grow the ecosystem beyond our borders to ensure the establishment of hydrogen infrastructure that will enable green corridors in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.\"\n\nGina acclaims that the company was able to successfully showcase its technology at these events, and how it can be used to successfully refuel the hydrogen vehicles, as well as the power of collaboration to overcome \"grand\" challenges.\n\n\"The big success for us was to display the technology and show that hydrogen is safe to use, and that it is available,\" Gina says, adding that the events demonstrated key stakeholders cooperating to achieve the goal of supplying hydrogen for the mobility space.\n\nHe expanded that the demonstration exhibited that high-pressure hydrogen is not as dangerous as people perceive, and that it can be used effectively as a fuel.\n\n\"We've been receiving a lot of inquiries about hydrogen supply and technology since then, and the demonstrations also sold the idea to several big stakeholders, including government,\" Gina avers.\n\nMoreover, he highlights that the demonstration showcased Air Products' ability to make hydrogen available anywhere in the country where it is required.\n\n\"We have state-of-the-art tube trailers, cylinders, dispensers and high compression equipment. Our view is that we have the product and technology and want to position ourselves as an enabler, for any organisation who would like to conduct trials with hydrogen - we can make it happen in South Africa, as well as beyond our borders.\"\n\nGina emphasises that the opportunity for South Africa in hydrogen exists particularly in the mobility space, to use hydrogen as an energy carrier that fuels vehicles. Currently, hydrogen is used as a utility in the petrochemical industry in the metal, glass, and mining processing industries for its chemical properties (mainly for reduction).\n\nHe says hydrogen as an energy carrier will also deliver environmental benefits, by reducing harmful emissions from vehicles, and is aligned to Air Products' sustainability strategy.\n\nHowever, Gina points out that the hydrogen mobility industry is still in early development in the country, as it is currently in the phase of undertaking demonstrations.\n\nGina explains that regions where this has taken off are those where there have been considerable government intervention and incentives, such as in Namibia, in California US, and some countries in Europe.\n\nHowever, he points out that hydrogen is not as bankable in South Africa as in some of the other regions, as the country does not have the luxury to fund it or implement it owing to many competing social challenges and the well-known power issues taking priority.\n\nThe green hydrogen production process itself is very power intensive. Transporting hydrogen to the end user is an even a bigger challenge, with the liquification and compression being very costly. The ammonia synthesis process is high temperature and pressure extracting a lot of energy which adds to the overall costs, Gina explains.\n\n\"This really forces us to be creative in terms of how we approach this. We are currently exploring the possibility of using existing assets and capabilities to grow the hydrogen economy organically with our partners as none of us can overcome this grand challenge by ourselves. The growth of the hydrogen economy requires a collaborative approach with multiple stakeholders to tailor-make a solution that will be suitable within the South African context as well as the SADC region\".\n\nGina mentions another constraint to the hydrogen mobility industry as the availability of vehicles. \"The manufacturers would be targeting Europe first, and then only bringing the vehicles to Africa,\" he points out. Gina explains that car manufacturers need to have the comfort that there is infrastructure locally to fuel these vehicles.\n\n\"It's a chicken and egg situation, as we cannot put the infrastructure in place if there are no vehicles available to make use of it yet.\"\n\nOn a more positive note, Gina says that, as the cost of renewable energy declines in the future, and electrolysers and fuel cells become more widely produced, it would become more affordable to produce and transport hydrogen.\n\nHe also points out that the country has the resources for the required renewable energy, and the mining industry has done a lot of work to demonstrate the future role of platinum group metals in electrolysis.\n\nGina also highlights that the country has the skills locally to support the development of the hydrogen economy. \"With the leadership of the Department of Science and Innovation we're well positioned compared to other countries for our hydrogen economy to take off.\"\n\nOver and above its work in furthering hydrogen in the mobility space in the country, Gina informs that Air Products is working with companies such as Bambili Energy to mitigate the current power challenges, where hydrogen fuel cells are used for backup power. He elaborates that there are opportunities to use hydrogen to replace diesel generators in malls, estates and residential properties, once it reaches a point where it is economically viable to do so.", "source": {"uri": "engineeringnews.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Engineering News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tasneem_bulbulia@engineeringnews.co.za", "name": "Tasneem Bulbulia", "type":

This article explores how green hydrogen, a clean energy source derived from renewable resources, is essential in diversifying energy supplies, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and enhancing global energy security.\n\nImage Credit: petrmalinak/Shutterstock.com\n\nIntroduction to Green Hydrogen\n\nGreen hydrogen represents a groundbreaking advancement in renewable energy technologies. It is produced through the electrolysis of water, a process that separates water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity derived from renewable sources, such as wind or solar power (International Energy Agency, 2023). This method ensures that hydrogen production is entirely free from carbon emissions.\n\nAs a versatile energy carrier, green hydrogen has the potential to significantly contribute to the decarbonization of various sectors, including transportation, industry, and power generation.\n\nIts role in the renewable energy mix is increasingly significant, offering a sustainable solution to store excess renewable energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, thereby supporting global efforts toward a cleaner, more resilient energy future (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022b).\n\nEnergy Security Overview\n\nEnergy security is a crucial aspect for nations, encompassing the reliable availability of energy resources at affordable prices (International Energy Agency, 2022b). It is critical because energy is foundational to maintaining economic stability, supporting societal needs, and ensuring national security.\n\nDisruptions in energy supply can have profound implications, ranging from economic downturns to compromising national security.\n\nEnergy diversification plays a significant role in enhancing energy security. By incorporating a variety of energy sources, including renewables like green hydrogen, countries can reduce their vulnerability to supply disruptions and price volatility associated with traditional fossil fuels (World Energy Council, 2020).\n\nDiversification also positions nations to transition more smoothly toward sustainable energy futures, mitigating the risks of climate change while ensuring a steady, secure energy supply.\n\nImpact of Green Hydrogen on Energy Security\n\nGreen hydrogen could significantly enhance energy security by reducing dependency on fossil fuels and mitigating geopolitical risks associated with their supply (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022b).\n\nBy harnessing renewable resources, such as solar and wind power, for hydrogen production, countries can localize energy production and reduce their reliance on imported fuels, which are often subject to geopolitical tensions and price fluctuations.\n\nGreen hydrogen also offers a stable and reliable energy supply, as it can be stored and transported for use when renewable energy generation is low.\n\nClick here to keep up-to-date with green hydrogen news and equipment\n\nCurrent projects exemplify green hydrogen's role in bolstering energy security. For instance, the European Union's Green Hydrogen Strategy aims to install at least 40 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2030, significantly contributing to the decarbonization of the energy system and reducing dependency on external energy suppliers (European Commission, 2020).\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate green hydrogen's potential to stabilize the energy supply and highlight its importance in achieving a secure, sustainable energy future.\n\nCase Study Analysis\n\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) positions green hydrogen as a key element in the context of energy transformation and geopolitical shifts.\n\nThe agency's analysis highlights hydrogen's role within the broader energy transition, emphasizing its potential to decarbonize challenging to electrify sectors.\n\nIRENA's insights suggest that the development of green hydrogen could usher in significant geopolitical and economic shifts, particularly for countries with abundant renewable resources, which could become major producers.\n\nThis shift toward green hydrogen necessitates a collective effort to navigate the uncertainties and capitalize on the opportunities presented by a burgeoning hydrogen market, which is crucial for achieving decarbonization goals and enhancing global energy security (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022a).\n\nOn the other side, Siemens Gamesa emphasizes green hydrogen's critical role in Europe's energy security, especially in light of the vulnerabilities exposed by geopolitical tensions. The company outlines the necessity of ramping up renewable energy production to ensure energy security and meet climate goals. It stresses that industries not easily electrified can achieve decarbonization through green hydrogen.\n\nSiemens Gamesa's call to action includes increasing renewable energy output, initiating green hydrogen infrastructure, and fostering a stable hydrogen market. This holistic approach aims to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels, ensuring a secure, sustainable energy future for Europe (Siemens Gamesa, 2022).\n\nChallenges and Opportunities of the Green Hydrogen Transition\n\nThe transition toward green hydrogen is fraught with challenges, primarily technological, economic, and infrastructure-related. Technologically, the efficiency of electrolyzers and the overall process of hydrogen production require advancements to reduce energy losses and increase output.\n\nEconomically, the high initial costs of setting up green hydrogen production facilities and the current price competitiveness compared to fossil fuels pose significant hurdles. Infrastructure-wise, the development of a comprehensive network for the transport and storage of hydrogen is critical yet challenging due to hydrogen's volatile nature (International Energy Agency, 2023).\n\nHowever, green hydrogen presents substantial opportunities. It offers a pathway to decarbonize heavy industries and transport sectors, areas where reducing carbon emissions has been particularly challenging. Moreover, green hydrogen can enhance global energy security by providing a storage solution for renewable energy, balancing supply and demand, and reducing dependency on fossil fuel imports (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022b).\n\nConclusion\n\nGreen hydrogen is set to transform global energy strategies and security significantly. This sustainable energy source offers a pathway to drastically reduce carbon emissions and decrease reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets, enhancing energy independence for countries worldwide.\n\nAs nations and industries prioritize sustainability, green hydrogen emerges as a critical tool in this transition, potentially stabilizing energy prices and fostering economic growth through new green industries.\n\nIts role in supporting the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid addresses intermittency issues, making energy supplies more reliable. This shift toward green hydrogen signifies a major step in combating climate change, reshaping global energy policies, and fortifying security strategies, ensuring a cleaner, more resilient, and secure energy future.\n\nRead More: The Benefits of Hydrogen Energy Hubs\n\nReferences and Further Reading\n\nEuropean Commission.

But what about the best and most promising fuel that you already know about? Just these days we have just learned about the new next-generation hydrogen engine, with unprecedented power and a curiosity that will surprise you. Is this the end of electric cars as we know?\n\nCummins, a top diesel, and natural gas engines brand, has teased an upcoming hydrogen engine which is expected to be used to power big trucks and other heavy big trucks in the future. The B67H is propelled by a hydrogen fuel cells engine and no waste gas is produced.\n\nB67H hydrogen engine offers quite a few benefits such as, higher fuel efficiency, lower carbon emissions, and longer operational ranges. A hydrogen fuel cell engine operates via electrochemical reaction, where hydrogen generates electricity that feeds to the vehicle's power system to upsurge the vehicle's range of motion.\n\nUnlike battery powered EVs which require significant numbers of battery units in packs, hydrogen fuel cell trucks can successively drive over 500 miles on the same level of capability for carrying as conventional diesel vehicles, as we have seen.\n\nThe B67H motor is good for outputting a 290 horsepower and 900 lb-ft of torque amount which is an enormous number. Now it only takes 15 mins to be refuelled and that's its what you call uninterrupted operation. Hydrogen engines ensure trucking applications with the distance, power and refueling speed necessary for this sector.\n\nThe novel Hydrogen engine B67H from Cummins has advanced some noticeable benefits as compare to the existing EV battery power supply. The B67H, however, delivers an impressive amount of horsepower and has the capability of quick refueling that can lead to longer travel distances between filling-ups.\n\nThe B67H outputs 290 hp which is more than one could ever imagine in a personal EVs. As an example, the 2022 model year of the Tesla Model 3 is able to produce as much as 358 hp, more expensive options are available, but with the Nissan Leaf that figure is only 147.\n\nThe highly performance of the B67H with the more horsepower makes its performance to be great, especially when its towing heavy loads. These turning engines prove hydrogen-powered ones to be perfect for the commercial vehicles industry and the scenic spots of Indian cities.\n\nRegarding that, the Hydrogen B67H requires only 5-15 minutes to be refueled what is diesel or gas refueling needs. It is a perfect equivalent, as EV battery can have 30 minutes to multiple hours charge volume, based on charging plug type.\n\nThe hydrogen B67H engine by Cummins is based on a diesel B67 platform series, which is a 6.7-liter class, in turn. Thus, unlike diesel combustion it was optimized to work with hydrogen burn. Fueling the thrill of driving and performance enthusiasts is the B67H that generates a massive 290 horsepower and an 449 lb-ft of torque.\n\nThe torque output resembles large diesel engines, which also demonstrates that hydrogen can have outperformed the power drivers are so used to, and be on the same level or even better. The 2 horse power capacity sits in the middle between impulsion and efficiency.\n\nIn this case, the B67H benchmarks the same engine model via an improving existing Cummins engine design to generate an era of hydrogen engines that remains within the hydrogen realm without investing in a complete engine redesign. This will enable a faster build and bestow hydrogen engines on consumers.\n\nAs you can see, this new next-generation hydrogen engine aims to be the definitive leap towards mobility beyond electricity. The key will be its incorporation into large fleets of buses, heavy transport and even trains, as advocated by the manufacturers themselves. However, it will also be used in cars for private use, which is what we are interested in.", "source": {"uri": "ecoticias.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ECOticias.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cummins", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel efficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric-vehicle_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric-vehicle battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nissan Leaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Farm_and_Ranch_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Farm and Ranch Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Professional_Exams", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Professional Exams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/hydrogen-engine-revistacultivar.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541087", "eventUri": "eng-9541087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Our manufacturing hub is a major national player in manufacturing innovation and the hydrogen truck is just one example.\"\n\nTouted as an Australian first, the big green truck is being trialed by Solo Resource & Recovery on the Gold Coast.\n\nThe proponent Pure Hydrogen has earmarked Dandenong for perhaps manufacturing the truck as well as being one of its main hydrogen-refuelling stations.\n\nInitially, the stations in Dandenong, Geelong and Port of Melbourne are expected to each produce 420 kilograms of hydrogen a day through solar and green electricity.\n\nIt would be enough to refuel about 20 trucks a day at each station.\n\nBy 2026, production is expected to rise to 1000 kilograms each a day.\n\nDandenong is also seen as a possible site to manufacture fleets of Pure Hydrogen buses and prime movers for domestic and export markets, as well as generators, electolysers and refuellers.\n\nPure Hydrogen national sales manager Clint Butler said currently the Australian-designed vehicles are being assembled in China.\n\n\"We're hoping in two or three years to have a factory in Queensland, NSW and Victoria - and Dandenong is one of the ones earmarked for Victoria.\"\n\nRecently, Casey Council announced its partnership with Cleanaway to trial a low-emission garbage truck running on converted cooking oils.\n\nCouncils, enthusiastic to reduce emissions, will start to force waste collection contractors to go hydrogen, Butler predicts.\n\n\"We field enquiries from councils from across Australia every day. As we have the trucks on the road, it will open the floodgates.\"\n\nButler says a dampener is the lack of government subsidies for hydrogen vehicles. In contrast, the US offers 80 per cent subsidies.\n\nAnother hand-brake is the lack of infrastructure, such as access to hydrogen fuel.\n\nPure Hydrogen is proposing 'hydrogen highways' of micro-hubs along Hume Highway, Western Highway and the Princes Freeway between Melbourne and Geelong.\n\nThese would refuel vehicles such as its Taurus prime mover, which has a range of 400 kilometres.\n\nIt also proposes mobile refuelers that will visit truck depots in Dandenong.\n\nThe technology has moved on from the Hindenburg airship disaster in 1937.\n\n\"Not a day goes by without hearing about the Hindenburg. Do you know since then we've put a man on the moon using hydrogen? And the International Space Station uses hydrogen to provide fresh water for its astronauts?\n\n\"Since the Hindenburg, we don't put hydrogen in a canvas balloon. We store it in a type-4 carbon cylinder which is the strongest part of the truck.\"\n\nWaste trucks often catch fire due to batteries being ill-advisedly disposed in household rubbish.\n\nIn such situations, the truck can expel its hydrogen load into the air within minutes - whereas diesel fuel gravitates under the truck.", "source": {"uri": "dandenong.starcommunity.com.au", "dataType":

While drastic transformations may be risky for business, small modifications can help future-forward companies move cautiously yet confidently toward new technology and energy transition. Because companies can identify and mitigate potential risks and pitfalls as they arise, they can preserve stability.\n\nA turbulent supply chain has created obstacles for utilities and private companies as they look to boost renewable energy output. However, plants can move toward progress and transformation by taking small but purposeful steps toward the energy transition, ultimately creating a safety net to protect against sudden upheaval or failure. This is especially significant for the mission-critical power-generation industry and heavy and hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel, glass, chemicals and transportation.\n\n\"There is an immediacy to the application of a technology-based retrofit solution to improve an existing asset's reliability and functionality,\" says Jeffrey Benoit, Vice President of Global Clean Energy Solutions at PSM, a Hanwha company specializing in clean energy retrofits and services for gas turbines. \"This is the epitome of the circular economy, where existing equipment in hard-to-abate sectors can be repurposed and revitalized, yielding impactful decarbonization results with comparatively low investments. In many cases and applications, 'rip and replace' of the existing turbine equipment and installing new does not necessarily mean 'better' -- especially in the gas turbine power sector.\"\n\nStandard gas-powered turbines are used across industries, powering everything from electrical generators and pumps to compressors. Nearly every plant has them, which means they also contribute to the Scope 3 emissions of virtually every downstream business in the supply chain.\n\nUpgrading standard gas turbines to use hydrogen fuel exemplifies the energy-transition improvements that are possible without replacing otherwise functional equipment. By taking advantage of revolutionary new retrofitting capabilities for gas turbines, equipment owners can accelerate their progress toward cleaner fuel by facilitating the use of hydrogen and natural gas blends. These hydrogen retrofits allow plants and heavy industries to improve their existing power-generation assets and create an affordable path in the clean energy transition.\n\nWhen it comes to energy per mass, hydrogen outperforms all other fuels. When burned in a gas turbine, its power output can equal or even outpace the output from fossil fuels.\n\nThrough straightforward retrofits and upgrades, nearly any existing combustion gas turbine can pivot to burn natural gas and hydrogen simultaneously. Modifying fuel and combustion systems (and relevant fuel accessories and safety systems) to be compatible with hydrogen can significantly reduce the amount of fossil natural gas fuel required. This results in an energy generation system with substantially lower carbon emissions. PSM is focused on delivering a retrofit solution that can consume any blend of natural gas and hydrogen, and the company is on its way to achieving this success. This creates the capability of fully decarbonized dispatchable power with 100% hydrogen when available without compromising the ability to provide power from fossil natural gas.\n\nUnlike other low-carbon or zero-carbon power sources, hydrogen's high-power output and heat generation capabilities make it well-suited for industrial applications where unabated carbon emission generation has historically been extremely difficult to address. Thus, hydrogen innovation can help factories and foundries in hard-to-abate industrial sectors preserve their existing systems and more cost-effectively achieve their renewable energy ambitions. Such upgrades improve capital return on investment for modifying original equipment and eliminate the cost and effort of disposing of the current equipment entirely.\n\nGroundbreaking hydrogen co-firing technologies can help plants:\n\nPSM, alongside other Hanwha affiliates Thomassen Energy and Hanwha Power Systems, recently became the first to successfully test a 60% hydrogen by volume blend in a retrofitted 80 MW gas turbine, which resulted in a 22% reduction of CO2 emissions compared to natural gas alone. The turbine used a mix of natural gas, hydrogen, and hydrogen-containing gas from the facility, with a proprietary blending system providing the necessary fuel delivery.\n\nThe next objective of this product development validation program is to operate gas turbines with 100% hydrogen or other renewable fuels to create carbon-free power generation in a net-zero world. Hanwha's preliminary testing in a controlled, full-operation condition test facility has shown the ability to run on 100% hydrogen, which, when applied to a commercial turbine application, will result in dispatchable power with no carbon footprint.\n\nWhile the technology development roadmap continues successfully towards 100% hydrogen fuel applications, that doesn't mean equipment owners can't take steps toward cleaner power generation now. Retrofitting turbines today to use a blend of natural gas and zero-carbon hydrogen fuel still significantly reduces a turbine's carbon emissions and could quickly meet the needs of turbine operators depending on their particular application and business objectives. This can be a sound staged approach, while other users will want to focus on applying combustion retrofits to turbines that are ready for full hydrogen conversion tomorrow.", "source": {"uri": "supplychaindive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Supply Chain Dive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gas turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofitting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Retrofitting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circular economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compressor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.supplychaindive.com/imgproxy/SggccBrMiVzmzRctDZlN7VMF--v0oRn5eTyxHxwidI4/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTE0MDg0MDQ4MzIuanBn.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541087", "eventUri": "eng-9541087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Perhaps, but research is limited", "body": "Companies market water bottles, pitchers and tablets to infuse water with more hydrogen. Proponents say hydrogen-rich water has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as other health benefits. Studies are limited.\n\nHydrogen-infused water has become increasingly popular, with companies selling often pricey water bottles that inject the gas into the liquid. Pitchers that add hydrogen to water with the push of a button and hydrogen tablets that can be dropped into a glass of water also are being hawked.\n\nProponents of hydrogen-enriched water claim it provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, slows the aging process and increases energy. Other sources indicate these promises are premature, and not backed by robust research.\n\nPlus, H2O already has hydrogen in it. So what does adding more hydrogen actually do?\n\nPhillyVoice asked that question - and many others - to Emily Rubin, the director of clinical dietetics at Thomas Jefferson University's Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Here is what she had to say.\n\nPhillyVoice: What is hydrogen water?\n\nEmily Rubin: Hydrogen water is essentially water infused with hydrogen gas, purportedly enhancing its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. ... Hydrogen, a colorless, odorless and harmless gas naturally binds with other elements like oxygen, nitrogen and carbon to form various compounds, including water and table sugar. While water molecules typically consist of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, some proponents argue that enriching water with extra hydrogen offers benefits beyond those of plain water. It's believed that the body may struggle to absorb hydrogen effectively from plain water due to its bonding with oxygen. Certain companies assert that by adding extra hydrogen, these molecules become \"free\" and more readily accessible to the body.\n\nNutritionally, hydrogen water aligns with regular water, containing no calories, carbohydrates, fats or proteins. Its mineral and vitamin composition may vary by provider and source, with some brands adding trace amounts of vitamins A and C, calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, potassium and sodium sulfate.\n\nPV: Does hydrogen water have anti-inflammatory or antioxidant properties?\n\nER: In one study lasting eight weeks, 49 individuals undergoing radiation therapy for liver cancer were divided into two groups. At the study's conclusion, participants who drank the hydrogen water exhibited reduced levels of hydroperoxide, a marker of oxidative stress, and maintained higher antioxidant activity post-radiation treatment compared to the control group.\n\nHowever, a recent four-week study involving 26 healthy individuals found that consuming 20 ounces of hydrogen-rich water daily did not lead to a decrease in oxidative stress markers, including hydroperoxide, when compared to a placebo group.\n\nFurther research is necessary to determine whether hydrogen consumption can mitigate oxidative stress effects in both healthy individuals and those with chronic conditions.\n\nPV: Does hydrogen water increase energy?\n\nER: Only calories provide energy, not water. If you are dehydrated, water and electrolytes may provide energy.\n\nPV: Does hydrogen water help improve muscle recovery?\n\nER: Only two small research studies support these claims. A study involving 10 male soccer players revealed that those who consumed 51 ounces of hydrogen-enriched water showed lower blood lactate levels and reduced muscle fatigue post-exercise compared to a placebo group. Similarly, a small two-week study involving eight male cyclists demonstrated that individuals who drank 68 ounces of hydrogen-enriched water daily exhibited increased power output during sprinting exercises compared to those consuming regular water. However, given the novelty of this research area, further studies are necessary to fully comprehend the potential benefits of hydrogen-enriched water for athletes.\n\nPV: Is there an overall study examining the potential benefits of hydrogen water that you think is solid?\n\nER: Hydrogen Water: Extra Healthy or a Hoax? reviewed 25 articles covering its effects on exercise capacity, liver function, cardiovascular health, mental well-being, COVID-19, oxidative stress and anti-aging research. While early findings from trials are positive, larger studies with robust methods are needed for validation.\n\nVarious factors influence the effectiveness of hydrogen-rich water, including its hydrogen concentration, methods of hydrogenation and duration of use. These factors can lead to varying outcomes, making it challenging to compare results across studies due to differences in hydrogen levels and quality. While many reviewed studies show promising results, it's important to note that most were conducted on animals, and some had small sample sizes, affecting the reliability and generalizability of findings. Future research should focus on larger trials to enhance statistical power and validity. Additionally, many studies have primarily examined short-term benefits and overlooked long-term effects. Some trials lacked a placebo control group, making it difficult to attribute observed results solely to hydrogen-rich water.\n\nTo fully understand the benefits of hydrogen-rich water, we require well-designed human studies with large sample sizes and long-term trials. Continued research may uncover hydrogen-rich water's potential as a supplementary therapeutic option in the future.\n\nPV: Are there adverse effects to drinking hydrogen-infused water?\n\nER: Hydrogen water holds a Generally Recognized as Safe status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, indicating its approval for human consumption without known harmful effects. Nevertheless, it's essential to note the absence of an industry-wide standard regarding the permissible amount of hydrogen that can be infused into water. Consequently, concentrations may significantly differ among products. However, its main drawbacks are its higher cost compared to tap water and the inconvenience of purchasing it.\n\nPV: Do people tend to over-hydrate these days?\n\nER: There is a push to over-hydrate via social media. Consumers need to be careful. When you consume too much water, it can lead to a condition known as hyponatremia or \"water intoxication.\" Excessive water intake can cause cells throughout your body, including brain cells, to swell. This swelling exerts pressure within the brain, resulting in symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness and headaches. Severe hyponatremia can lead to seizures, coma or death.\n\nThe U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have established guidelines for adequate daily fluid intake, recommending approximately 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) for men and about 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) for women. These recommendations encompass fluids obtained from water, other beverages and food, with roughly 20% of daily fluid intake typically sourced from food and the remainder from drinks. While the common advice to drink eight glasses of water daily is easy to recall and a reasonable target, individual fluid needs can vary. For most healthy individuals, staying hydrated can be achieved by drinking water and other fluids whenever thirst arises, with some requiring fewer than eight glasses per day while others may need more.\n\nMonitoring the color of your urine can indicate hydration levels. Pale yellow to tea-colored urine suggests proper hydration, while clear urine may indicate excessive water intake. Urinating more frequently than usual (more than 10 times a day) may indicate overhydration. Pay attention to your body's cues as thirst is a natural indicator of hydration needs.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oxidative stress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-inflammatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antioxidant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_(pharmacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet (pharmacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ER (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroperoxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydroperoxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gastroenterology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sucrose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calorie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Properties of water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molecule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dietitian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academies_of_Sciences,_Engineering,_and_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Environmental_Chemistry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Environmental Chemistry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/050424_Hydrogen_Water_Bottle.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541087", "eventUri": "eng-9541087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

We aim to inspire curiosity in 'The Science of Everything' and make the world of science accessible to everyone.\n\nAn Australian energy company is teaming up with the CSIRO to work out if hydrogen can be safely stored underground in depleted gas fields in Victoria.\n\nLochard Energy's H2RESTORE project is investigating the opportunity to use its existing gas fields for underground hydrogen storage, which is described as: \"to shift low carbon energy seasonally.\"\n\nIn March the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) awarded $2m from its Advancing Renewables Program towards Lochard Energy's 18-month $6.3 million study. In Europe two experimental sites are also testing underground hydrogen storage in depleted gas fields.\n\nThe CSIRO is assisting with the technical analysis of how hydrogen will behave in subsurface sandstone formations, 1400 to 1800m below the surface.\n\nDr Jonathan Ennis-King, Reservoir Simulation and Underground Storage Characterisation Team Leader at the CSIRO, says a major question is how stored hydrogen might interact with the rocks, fluids and microbes in the existing gas field, and the cement used for well construction.\n\n\"We will conduct laboratory studies, exposing rock samples from the relevant sites to hydrogen at subsurface temperature and pressure, over a period of weeks to months,\" says Dr Ennis-King.\n\n\"We will perform similar tests on samples of wellbore cement, to see if there are any changes due to hydrogen exposure. Matching lab results with theoretical modelling will enable us to make predictions at the field scale.\"\n\nHydrogen can be stored in tanks as a gas under pressure or as a liquid at very cold temperatures. However, for large-scale storage of hydrogen, Ennis-King says the cheapest and safest options are found underground. These include salt caverns, depleted gas fields, saline aquifers, or engineered hard-rock caverns.\n\nSalt cavern storage is the most-ready technology. However, depleted gas field storage is widely available in Australia and will require less upfront investment. Depleted gas fields are geological formations previously used to extract natural gas. In depleted fields, hydrogen could be stored in the pores of naturally occurring sandstone formations, beneath formations that prevent the movement of gases.\n\nIf Lochard Energy's investigations are successful, it is looking to build a pilot hydrogen production and storage plant. The plant could use abundant renewable energy from the grid to produce hydrogen and store it until it's needed weeks or months later to provide energy back into the grid.\n\nDr Joel Sarout, Geomechanics & Multi-physics Group Leader at CSIRO, wrote in March 2024 that cost-effective, large-scale hydrogen storage \"will be a game-changer to the emerging hydrogen industry, supporting a range of domestic and export applications across sectors.\n\n\"To lower initial capital costs/investments, and potentially reduce operating costs, two geological storage and management options are effectively considered in Australia - blending up to 10-15% hydrogen in existing seasonal subsurface natural gas reservoirs and high purity hydrogen storage in aquifers and depleted gas (or possibly oil) reservoirs.\n\n\"Hydrogen mobility through porous reservoir rocks and the impact of geochemical interactions with the rock frame in presence of formation brine are currently poorly understood, with extremely limited hard data available in the literature.\n\n\"Hydrogen is expected to progressively diffuse into water (2 to 5% in the long-term), while strongly reacting with iron-bearing minerals (clays, iron oxides/sulphides) and organic matter.\n\n\"To what extent such reactions will affect pore structure and mineral composition remains to be assessed, and the impact on rock properties (transport, storage, mechanical, seismic) needs evaluating at pressure conditions relevant for the target reservoir depths.\"\n\nSarout has been leading the development of CSIRO's rock-hydrogen laboratory capabilities in Perth allowing for this type of critical feasibility assessment for multiple geological settings, spanning from underground caverns in rock salt formations, to depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs.", "source": {"uri": "cosmosmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cosmos Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CSIRO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saline water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aquifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borehole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borehole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lochard-Energys-site-in-Victoria.JPG.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541087", "eventUri": "eng-9541087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

This is caused by the presence and interaction of hydrogen with applied stresses. Therefore, it is important to quantify the hydrogen content which could be dissolved under applied stresses in steel. Water contamination of lubricants is often considered as a reason of hydrogen embrittlement of rolling bearings. Thus the effect of water and %RH (relative humidity) on the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of steel was studied experimentally under different operating conditions. Two types of steels were used, that are silver steel and AISI-52100 ball bearing steel. The testing conditions used in various tests, were percent relative humidity (%RH), temperature, rotating bending stresses, uni-axial tensile stress, rolling and sliding in combination with rotating bending stresses. As a first task, the hydrogen content was quantified in as-received specimens of bearing steel. The spread of hydrogen content was measured in radial and axial directions of the as-received bearing steel bars. This was done to show the importance of the internal hydrogen embrittlement effects of the initial hydrogen content. Sample melting technique (SMT) was used to quantitatively analyze the total content of hydrogen in all specimens using a hydrogen analyzer. In addition to this, Elastic Recoil Detection Technique (ERDT) was employed to qualitatively analyze the local hydrogen content distribution in soft and hard AISI-52100 bearing steel. Secondly, the influence of applied stresses on the absorption of hydrogen content into respective steel specimens was studied. A rotating bending set up was used through a lathe machine. Water was used as a source of hydrogen charging of the testing samples in all rotating bending tests. The influence of rotating bending stresses on the absorption of hydrogen was studied in silver steel and in bearing steel bar samples. Further, a universal fatigue testing machine was used to study the effect of cyclic released uni-axial tension on the absorption of hydrogen in the bearing steel. Similarly, the influence of Sliding and Rolling on the absorption/desorption of hydrogen content was studied in combination of rotating bending stresses using the same lathe machine. Mild and water quenched silver steel bar specimens were used to study the influence of quenching and applied stresses on the absorption of hydrogen. Finally, the experiments were conducted on SKF-624 deep groove ball bearing (DGBB) under isolated operating environment. Non water absorbing grease was used as lubricant. Tests were run for 10% of L10 life of deep groove ball bearing. Two different amplitudes of pure radial loading were selected for testing under high and low relative humidity of the operating environment. Total content of hydrogen was measured in the inner ring, outer ring and 7-balls of DGBB (deep groove ball bearing) using the hydrogen analyzer.

Catalina was awarded \u20ac230 million while Madoqua was awarded \u20ac245 million.\n\nThe two projects are cornerstones in the future decarbonisation of European hard-to-abate energy sectors like shipping and heavy industries. Together, they represent a combined electrolyser capacity of 1000 MW.\n\nCatalina is a hydrogen project with an electrolyser capacity of 500 MW located in Aragon in the north of Spain. The project will produce green hydrogen to reduce carbon emissions from industrial applications. Madoqua, located in Sines, Portugal, is a Power-to-X facility that will produce green hydrogen and ammonia primarily for shipping. It has an initial electrolyser capacity of 500 MW.\n\nThe two projects have been invited for Grant Agreement preparation with the European Commission. Catalina will receive a production grant with a fixed premium of \u20ac0.48/kg hydrogen (H) for ~48 000 tpy H over a 10-year period, an expected total of \u20ac230.5 million. Madoqua will receive a fixed premium of \u20ac0.48/kg H for ~51 000 tpy H over a 10-year period, an expected total of \u20ac245 million.\n\n\"We are very proud that our projects have been awarded this grant, and we applaud European policy makers for recognising the importance of the hydrogen economy in Europe. This pilot auction shows that the economy behind a future hydrogen industry is maturing, demonstrated by these competitive bids. Today's announcement is a proof point of CIP's ability to deliver green hydrogen projects for building a future hydrogen economy in Europe. We would like to thank our partners in both Portugal and Spain as well as the authorities and local communities in both countries for working with us in creating a greener future for the coming generations of Europeans,\" said S\u00f8ren Toftgaard, on behalf of the partner group of the Energy Transition Fund.\n\nThe projects will receive the awarded funding from the date of commercial operation until the end of the 10-year grant period. The grants are bringing the projects closer to financial investment decision by reducing the gap between cost price and sales price and are important enablers for the success of the projects. The grant is dependent on the two projects being operational within five years of signing the grant agreement. CIP expects the two projects to be operational no later than 2029.\n\nThe Spring 2024 issue of Energy Global starts with a guest comment from Field on how battery storage sites can serve as a viable solution to curtailed energy, before moving on to a regional report from Th\u00e9odore Reed-Martin, Editorial Assistant, Energy Global, looking at the state of renewables in Europe.

Researcher Dmitrii Semenok tells pv magazine that \"it is a question of changing the approach to the search for promising hydrogen storage materials.\"\n\nRussian, Chinese, Japanese, and Italian scientists synthesized two polyhydrides - cesium heptahydride (CsH7) and rubidium nonahydride (RbH9) - for chemical storage of hydrogen that \"can absorb as much four times\" hydrogen as frequently used magnesium-nickel and zirconium-vanadium alloys.\n\n\"Our work demonstrates that cesium and rubidium have prospects for increasing the capacity of hydrogen batteries by stabilizing the shell of molecular hydrogen, and open a way for further reducing the synthesis pressure of polyhydrides,\" the authors wrote in \"Raisins in a Hydrogen Pie: Ultrastable Cesium and Rubidium Polyhydrides\", published in Advanced Energy Materials.\n\nCesium (Cs) and rubidium (Rb) pack seven and nine hydrogen atoms respectively per metal atom.\n\n\"The proportion of hydrogen atoms in these compounds is one of the highest among all known polyhydrides, twice as high as in methane CH,\" Dmitrii Semenok, corresponding author and researcher at China's Center for High Pressure Science & Technology Advanced Research (HPSTAR), told pv magazine.\n\nSemenok underlined that \u0421s and Rb are relatively heavy atoms. \"For rubidium hydride RbH9 the mass content of hydrogen is about 9.6% wt. This is also a very good result. The only problem is the need to apply pressure to synthesise these compounds,\" commented the researcher.\n\nThe researcher explains that cesium and rubidium and their hydrides present two additional problems. Global production of Cs and Rb is significantly inferior to other alkali metals, and their cost is substantially higher than that of lithium, sodium or potassium.\n\nAt the same time, they are very active metals that easily catch fire in air and react with water with explosion and formation of strongest alkalis RbOH and CsOH.\n\nThe compounds are therefore inconvenient for hydrogen storage, but the study led by Russia's Skoltech and China's HPSTAR suggests that rubidium and cesium additives can improve the efficiency of existing H2 batteries.\n\n\"It is a question of changing the approach to the search for promising hydrogen storage materials. We work at much higher pressures than previously accepted in this field. And we use elements that tend to form higher polyhydrides at low pressures,\" said Semenok.\n\nHe added that systems such as Strontium-Rubidium Sr-Rb-H, Strontium-Rb-Zirconium-H, Rb-Magnesium-H may prove promising in terms of hydrogen storage and remain stable under ambient conditions after they are saturated with hydrogen at high pressure of several GPa or even lower.\n\n\"The formation of higher cesium and rubidium hydrides at a relatively low pressure of about 10 GPa was predicted theoretically more than 10 years ago in the works of the group of E. Zurek (UB). The problem was only in the experimental validation of these results. Since the discovery of sulfur trihydride (HS), the main attention of experimentalists has been focused on superconducting hydrides,\" Semenok said, explaining why previous studies neglected the potential role of molecular polyhydrides based on cesium and rubidium\n\nOnly recently the situation has changed due to the exhaustion of the class of binary superconducting hydrides. \"The expansion of the research field to alkali and alkaline earth metals in 2021-2022 immediately led to the discovery of stable molecular polyhydrides of Cs, Rb, Ba and Sr, predicted back in 2012-2015\".\n\nIn the paper, the researchers also proposed a new method for synthesis of metal polyhydrides via high-pressure thermal decomposition of corresponding amidoboranes in diamond anvil cells.\n\n\"We now intend to repeat the experiment using large-scale hydraulic presses at a lower pressure -- about 10,000 atmospheres -- to obtain larger amounts of cesium and rubidium polyhydrides and verify that once synthesized, these compounds remain stable even at atmospheric pressure, unlike the other polyhydrides known to date. This is an important task from a fundamental point of view. We need to answer the question how long metastable polyhydrides will exist under ambient conditions,\" said Semenok, adding that they could exist in a very wide range of time - a fraction of seconds or hundreds of days.", "source": {"uri": "pv-magazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pv magazine International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sergio_matalucci@pv-magazine.com", "name": "Sergio Matalucci", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caesium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubidium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rubidium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen atom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydride", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical synthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alloy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubidium_hydride", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rubidium hydride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_hydroxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caesium hydroxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alkali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alkali metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Potassium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lithium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sodium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Instruments_and_Supplies/Isotopes", "label": "dmoz/Science/Instruments and Supplies/Isotopes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Figure_1-280x280.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541087", "eventUri": "eng-9541087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

In 2021, President Joe Biden called for achieving a 100% carbon-free electric sector by 2035. Twenty-three states have enacted statutes or issued executive orders to achieve net-zero electricity generation by 2050.\n\nBecause of net-zero mandates, grid operators spent the last two decades replacing coal-fired power plants with natural gas plants, wind turbines, and solar installations. More than 200 coal plants have been closed, reducing electricity output from coal by almost 60% since 2007. From 2000 to 2023, wind and solar output rose from near zero to a combined 14.1% of production. Over the same period, natural gas rose from 16.2% to 43.1% of power generation.\n\nBut grid operators in many states now face an unprecedented ramp in electricity demand.\n\nThe forced transition to green energy drives three new sources of power demand. First, 22 states have zero-emissions vehicle mandates, which intend to ban the sale of gasoline cars by 2035. This March, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized regulations to force about 40% of new light vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric. To the extent that electric vehicles are adopted, the grid will need to deliver large amounts of additional power.\n\nSecond, cities and counties in seven states have banned gas appliances in new housing, such as New York City. In 2022, ISO New England concluded that a shift from gas appliances to electric appliances in New England would require more new electricity than a shift to EVs.\n\nThird, the U.S. federal government proposes to establish a new green hydrogen fuel industry. Seven billion dollars has been earmarked for \"regional hydrogen hubs\" to try to stimulate hydrogen production. Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water and uses large amounts of electricity. To produce a single kilogram of hydrogen from electrolysis requires 50 to 55 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is about double the daily electricity used by a typical U.S. home.\n\nBut the electricity needed for the new artificial intelligence revolution will be greater than that needed for EVs, electric appliances, and green hydrogen combined. Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and dozens of other firms are building massive new multi-acre data centers. In addition to new facilities, servers in the nation's 2,700 data centers are being upgraded with new high-performance processing cards, boosting power consumption by six to 10 times. Today, data centers use about 4% of U.S. electricity, but the AI revolution is expected to boost that demand to more than 20% of electricity consumption within the next 10 years.\n\nRapidly rising power demand from the AI revolution, along with EVs, home appliances, and the proposed hydrogen fuel industry, caught U.S. grid operators unprepared. We are now entering a decade in which electricity demand will exceed what can be supplied by a large margin.\n\nThe coming power shortage will produce two big economic impacts. First, electrical utilities will cease the premature shutdown of coal, gas, and nuclear power plants. It will be impossible to construct enough new wind and solar generators to provide electricity to meet the new demand for AI data centers, let alone the needs of electric vehicles, electric appliances, and hydrogen electrolyzer.\n\nThe second economic impact will be rapidly rising electricity prices, driven by a growing disparity between power demand and supply. Higher prices will reduce the demand for heat pumps endorsed by the green energy movement, which will remain more expensive than natural gas and propane furnaces in cold regions. EVs will be more expensive to charge and public EV charging facilities will struggle to be profitable. Gasoline cars will hold cost advantages for decades to come. Efforts to establish a green hydrogen fuel industry will remain costly and produce only a tiny market.\n\nThe biggest impact will be on efforts to transition to a net-zero electrical grid. The coming power shortage will cripple these efforts. It will be impossible to serve both the AI revolution and pursue a transition to wind and solar systems. The green energy transition will be sacrificed in favor of generating enough electrical power.", "source": {"uri": "naturalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NaturalNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home appliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis of water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2024/05/power-grid-electrical-wires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541087", "eventUri": "eng-9541087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

This stock.", "body": "'Guy on Rocks' is a Stockhead series looking at the significant happenings of the resources market each week. Former geologist and experienced stockbroker Guy Le Page, director, and responsible executive at Perth-based financial services provider RM Corporate Finance, shares his high conviction views on the market and his \"hot stocks to watch\".\n\nMarket Ructions\n\nGold is off just under US$30 over the last seven days of trading and is hovering around US$2,295/ounce (figure 1) representing a four-week low as investors assess the FOMC meeting earlier last week with Chairman Jerome Powell indicating that interest rates were unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.\n\nEasing tensions in the Middle East, persistent inflation and a stronger than expected US economy have all weighed on the gold price.\n\nPlatinum fared better, up US$44 over the week rebounding from US$900/ounce a week earlier in response to job cuts and anticipated mine closures for Impala Platinum which the World Platinum Investment Council believe will result in an average annual deficit of 500,000 ounces through to 2028.\n\nPalladium continues to come under heavy selling pressure and finished at US$936.50/ounce down US$50 over the last seven days.\n\nCopper prices (figure 2) dropped back to US$4.5/lb per pound, after reaching a two-year high of US$4.70/lb In late April.\n\nRecent soft manufacturing data from the US showed that factory activity contracted in April.\n\nThe big news last week (other than American West Metals (ASX:AW1) getting back on the ground in Canada last week) was BHP's seemingly unsuccessful swing at Anglo American.\n\nWe are starting to also see an increase in activity on the junior end including a back door listing and $6 million capital raising in Mongolian copper explorer Asian Battery Minerals (ASX:AZ9) which is being backed into the old Doriemus (ASX:DOR) shell. Previous exploration has returned some interesting intercepts including 73 metres @ 0.59% Cu and 0.42% nickel from 172 metres downhole.\n\nUnfortunately, the old Doriemus couldn't replicate the form of that magnificent pony that won the Caufield and Melbourne Cups back in 1995.\n\nI think this is the first of many copper financings on ASX including a wave of Australian explorers having a big swing in Canada; this includes Tempus Resources (ASX:TMR) that recently announced its proposed acquisition of unlisted explorer Somerset Minerals that has acquired a large landing west of AW1 in the Nunavut region of northern Canada.\n\nThere hasn't been much joy on the nickel front in the last couple of years with the most recent casualty being First Quantum Minerals' Ravensthorpe nickel mine that recently announced the mine was going on care and maintenance with the loss of 530 jobs.\n\nWith the nickel laterite producers under pressure as nickel (figure 3) drifted to under US$16,000/tonne, the price has recovered to just under US$18,800.tonne.\n\nThe one bright spot however was the news that Ardea Resources (ASX:ARL) (figure 4) has formed a 50:50 incorporated joint venture with Sumitomo Metal Mining Co and Mitsubishi Corporation to form a 50:50 incorporated joint venture to develop the Kalgoorlie Nickel Project - Goongarrie Hub through to a Definitive Feasibility Study and hopefully production depending on the outcomes of this study.\n\nI have been following this story for decades, around about the time that colour television arrived in the great State of Western Australia, so let's hope that this project, which has been studied more times than the Holy Shroud of Turin, can finally get off the ground.\n\nNew Ideas: White hydrogen\n\nI haven't been a huge fan of the hydrogen story given how difficult it is to store and transport hydrogen. It took some convincing, however the white hydrogen story could have serious legs.\n\nWhite hydrogen is hydrogen generated via the reaction between iron rich rocks and water (below) and is captured similar to hydrocarbons (figure 6).\n\nAccording to the luminaries at Hannam Partners in London, HyTerra (ASX:HYT) (figure 5), led by ex-Shell/Woodside Petroleum geologist Ben Mee, is a standout play and one of the few explorers with projects in Kansas and Nebraska.\n\nHyTerra is proposing (figure 7) to spend ~$2m drilling two holes in the 2nd-3rd Quarter this year and is looking to prove up commercial quantities of natural hydrogen and helium.\n\nOne of the key selling points on their 9,600-acre, 100% tenement is that there are over 10 occurrences within the region containing up to 92% hydrogen and 3% helium (figure 9).\n\nBen Mee's business model thesis is that the lowest cost molecule wins every day. White hydrogen has a low-cost profile (figure 8) compared to other forms of hydrogen.\n\nAnother big selling point is the concentration of agriculture and manufacturing industries connected by railway and roads.\n\nPotential off-takers nearby include ethanol and ammonia manufacturers, and petrochemical plants with good inter-connectivity via via railways, roads, and/or pipelines.\n\nBased on 50% H2 concentrations, Hyterra sees a break-even or levelised cost of hydrogen of US$2.2/kg (US$5.1/mcf) but we see the potential to reach Guy Le Page is a director and responsible executive at Perth-based financial services provider RM Corporate Finance. A former geologist and experienced stockbroker, he is involved in a range of corporate initiatives from mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings to valuations, consulting and corporate advisory roles.\n\nHe was head of research at Morgan Stockbroking Limited (Perth) prior to joining Tolhurst Noall as a Corporate Advisor in July 1998. Prior to entering the stockbroking industry, he spent 10 years as an exploration and mining geologist in Australia, Canada, and the United States.", "source": {"uri": "stockhead.com.au", "dataType":

These facilities include a nitrogen generation unit, fire service water tanks and pumps, an emergency diesel generator and a wastewater unit.\n\nThe company wants to build a 12.7 km carbon steel ammonia pipeline from the terminal to Farm 58 near Dune 7, and an 80 km carbon steel green hydrogen pipeline between Farm 58 and Arandis, which will store 15 000 m\u00b3 of gas on a daily basis.\n\nA solar park spanning 10 hectares, accompanied by a hydrogen production facility equipped with a 5 MW electrolyser and a 5 MWh battery, are components of the green hydrogen demonstration plant on Farm 58.\n\nThe hydrogen pipeline may run from Arandis and through Namib-Naukluft Park straight to Walvis Bay, or it will pass near Swakopmund, while the ammonia pipeline will turn at Swakopmund before continuing to the harbour further south.\n\nGreen development ongoing\n\nMeanwhile, a major player in the push for green hydrogen in Namibia, Hyphen Energy, which won the government concession to kick-start the massive Tsau ?Khaeb National Park-based Southern Corridor Development Initiative, is partnering with experts.\n\nThe Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy Systems (IWES) will apply innovative, precise approaches for wind field calculations to optimise yield. The area where the Hyphen wind farm will be situated is located on the coast south of L\u00fcderitz.\n\nBy harnessing global reanalysis data sources, Fraunhofer IWES will be capable of conducting precise wind field calculations down to a few kilometres.\n\nEnertrag, a renewable energy service provider, will furnish measurement data to be integrated into simulations, facilitating correlation and calibration with the efforts of Fraunhofer IWES.\n\nHyphen CEO Marco Raffinetti said: \"The team at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy Systems (IWES) brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to Hyphen and will help drive our project forward using innovative techniques and first-class analysis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, construction continues at Daures Green Hydrogen Village in the Erongo Region, while the research initiative aims to inaugurate its pilot facility in the second quarter of this year.\n\nDaures management recently participated in the Green Hydrogen in Practice Symposium hosted by the Southern African Science Service Centre for Climate Change and Adaptive Land Management (SASSCAL) initiative in Windhoek at the end of March.", "source": {"uri": "az.com.na", "dataType":

However, they are not the only ones showing that there is something beyond EVs. Just this 2024 we have met an engine that has experts in suspense for a curious reason: it has traveled 80 years in time and runs on a futuristic fuel.\n\nHydrogen engine began in the history of World War II, It has an interesting introduction that dates until War II. An inverted opposed-piston design was developed by the US engineer Anselm Franz in the 1940s that took hydrogen fuel.\n\nIt was world's first engine of its kind, and its fuel consumption was lower in comparison to the piston engine product models which were widely used at that time. Further it had high power density and reliability. Franz, the inventor, had created a human-driven engine that was quite compact and lightweight for aviation.\n\nOf all fuels considered at that time, hydrogen had probably the highest of energy intensity per weight as the output energy was much higher than the weight of shipped hydrogen. An opposed-piston engine, instead of a radial piston, was the key to the fact that it could be more lightweight and compact.\n\nIn 1942, the first 100% hydrogen-powered aircraft successfully flew under Franz, which marked a significant milestone during the war. The prototype of a new-turbo -generator demonstrated its leading role in the development of engines aviation of tomorrow.\n\nAchates Power is a California-based company that has been developing opposed-piston engines since 2004. Opposed-piston engines use two pistons in each cylinder, working in opposite directions. This design provides better thermal efficiency and packaging compared to traditional engines.\n\nAchates has modernized the opposed-piston design by using computer modeling and simulation tools. They have optimized the combustion chamber design and improved performance. Their opposed-piston engines provide up to 30% better fuel efficiency compared to today's diesel engines.\n\nThe opposed-piston design is mechanically simpler, with fewer parts than contemporary engines. This improves reliability and reduces cost. Achates engines do not need complex turbocharger or aftertreatment systems required by modern diesels to meet emissions standards.\n\nBy combining the opposed-piston architecture with 21st century materials and computational modeling, Achates has innovated on a decades-old concept. Their opposed-piston engines provide a clean, efficient powertrain technology that is viable for transportation applications today.\n\nThe most widely of the major vehicle manufacturers and suppliers are considering to design hydrogen engines instead of the old type of the internal ones. Toyota has been working on a hydrogen combustion engine which is vigorously tested in their prototypes and as a large example, the Mirai.\n\nThe BMW Hydrogen has already run ethanol engine prototype and is watching the technology, but it is yet to commit becoming a consumer product. The company has a foresight that hydrogen engines can be used on the larger motors, such as the SUVs and trucks, which have advanced power requirements.\n\nNot only the main manufactures, but also critical auto parts suppliers are developing hydrogen components that would be introduced into cars. Bosch has thus successfully developed hydrogen-injectors, air-flow sensors, and control small units.\n\nThe most curious thing about this new hydrogen engine (or not so new, you've already seen it) is that it works with such a futuristic concept that we have not even been able to put into practice. How is it possible that 80 years ago we were already talking about this fuel and we have not been able to develop a sufficient network of refueling stations?

Most of those sales, it expects, will be driven by their commercial customers. In the US, that means RAM Trucks.\n\n\"This year, we are starting production of larger vehicles in Poland,\" Stellantis' hydrogen program, Jean-Michel Billig, told German-language magazine Welt. \"And development in North America should follow quickly - especially with the large RAM 5500 in a fuel cell version.\"\n\nIf you're not familiar with RAM's medium duty commercial offerings, know that they're the bigger, beefier cousins of the RAM pickup trucks you probably have seen. The 5500 series is, as the numerical designation implies, rated to both carry and tow significantly more mass -- offering a stout 19,500 lb. gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) compared to the mere 6,010 lb. GVWR offered by the base RAM 1500 pickup and nearly double the 10,000 lb. rating offered by a Cummins-powered RAM 2500.\n\nThey're serious trucks, in other words. Work trucks. And, as such, they can't afford the kind of downtime that many fleet managers currently associate with battery electrics.\n\nThat said, the amount of time needed to charge an electric truck continues to drop as faster charging speeds couple with in-ground wireless charging and \"piggyback\" battery systems to keep pushing downtime lower and lower. At the same time, the retail price of hydrogen remains stubbornly high.\n\nStellantis, though, thinks the market will be there when (if) costs come down. \"In the coming decade, we expect a significant market share for [hydrogen] technology,\" Billig added. \"In commercial vehicles it could be up to 40%.\"\n\nProduction for the new hydrogen RAM is expected to take place at Stellantis' Saltillo, Mexico truck assembly plant, which has been in operation since 1995.\n\nI talked to a fellow Electrekkie (Electrekker?) about this RAM story as I was typing it up, and their response was a perfect combination of spot-on and hilarious. \"Fleets love the idea of saving money on running costs,\" they said. \"So tell them their fuel is going to cost 4x as much, and the up-front cost of the trucks is higher. Sure! What an easy sell!\"\n\nI can't help but think this is the correct take, especially in light of the fact that hydrogen has recently spiked over $30 per kg, and that a kilogram of hydrogen has about as much energy in it as a gallon of gas.\n\nEven at half that price, though, the math doesn't add up ... and that's not me saying that. It's Real Industry People\u2122\ufe0f. \"Today you cannot buy hydrogen for less than 13 or 14 euros,\" said MAN Trucks CEO, Alexander Vlaskamp. \"And it is not green. And when we have green hydrogen it will be needed for the heavy industry of steel, cement, or plastic.\"\n\nNOTE: quotes attributed to Jean-Michel Billig were translated from German using Google Translate.", "source": {"uri": "electrek.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Electrek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jo_borras@electrek.co", "name": "Jo Borr\u00e1s", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stellantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Trucks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ram Trucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_pickup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ram pickup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_van", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panel van"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAN_SE", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MAN SE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltillo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saltillo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saltillo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Emergency_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Emergency Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/ram-5500.png?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541087", "eventUri": "eng-9541087", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

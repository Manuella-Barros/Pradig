A group of older youths, not from their school, started shouting at them. \u201cWhy are you sitting next to a \u2018P***?\u2019 the older youths demanded of Harry, referencing that his best friend was of Pakistani-British origin. The two boys continued giggling, not quite sure how to react. Then one of the white youths got up and walked down the aisle of the public bus to where the pair were sitting. Without warning, he kicked Harry in the head and slammed his head against the window \u2013 leaving him bloodied, bruised and in shock \u2013 before the youths stopped the bus and ran off. Alerted to what had just happened, the bus driver came upstairs to check on the boys and, discovering that Harry\u2019s head was bleeding significantly, drove his bus off route to the local hospital where Harry received treatment. Twelve-year-old Harry and his mum had no Victim Support to turn to after the attack It\u2019s more than 20-years since this unprovoked attack rocked the life of Harry and his family. But more than two decades on, this incident involving her son still inspires Perth woman Elizabeth (Elizabeth has asked that we withhold her surname to protect her full identity) to volunteer with Victim Support Scotland. For eight years, since retiring, she has helped deliver free and tailored support to victims and witnesses of crime. For the past four years this has been in the Perth and Perthshire area. Now the retired public sector worker is backing a new national recruitment drive by Victim Support Scotland seeking more than 200 volunteers across the country. In an interview with The Courier, Elizabeth explained how she first started to volunteer \u2013 when retirement gave her time \u2013 after discovering that following her son\u2019s attack, neither she nor her son felt they had anybody to turn to during the investigation. \u201cWhat was really noticeable after the attack was there was no real follow-up or support for him or us \u2013 it was all quite a shock!\u201d, she said of the incident which took place in 2002. \u201cI expect it\u2019s one of these things that lots of families experience. Objectively I guess it\u2019s quite a low level incident. But for the family it was quite frightening. \u201cMy son was very young and out of the blue, he was attacked. \u201cThese bullies saw a white boy and a Pakistani boy and decided they were going to have a go. They were small and vulnerable. \u201cHe was taken completely by surprise and the shock lasted a long time.\u201d What impact did the attack have on 12-year-old Harry and his mum? Elizabeth, who\u2019s originally from Manchester and has lived in Sheffield and Bradford, admires the resilience of children. Her son, now 34, went on to live and work abroad. However, for a long time, Harry struggled to go back on a bus. At first, he was nervous about going by himself. When he did go back, he would sit down the stairs. But he also rarely talked about the attack. When he did, he\u2019d say the sort of things that Elizabeth now hears all the time from victims of crime. He\u2019d say things like \u2018why me? and \u2018what did I do wrong?\u2019 \u2013 questioning his own behaviour rather than those who had perpetrated the action. Reflecting on the incident, which took place in Sheffield where they lived at the time, Elizabeth says it\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d that the Pakistani boy was not attacked in what was clearly a racially motivated attack by cowardly bullies. Living in a \u201cmixed community\u201d, the Pakistani boy was \u201cjust his mate\u201d. Race was never an issue for them or their peer group. However, what would have benefitted Harry greatly, says Elizabeth, would have been the opportunity to talk to someone independent of the family \u2013 a service that wasn\u2019t available in those days. Why would Victim Support have helped Elizabeth and her son after the attack? \u201cKids don\u2019t often want to talk about things to their mum and dad,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they get on a lot better speaking to someone with no axe to grind, totally independent, who can listen sympathetically if they are worried, questioning \u2013 why did it happen to me? I\u2019m feeling scared? Am I being silly to feel scared?\u201d Elizabeth says that what she\u2019s learned from working with Victim Support Scotland is these are common questions people ask irrespective of the crime. It\u2019s the impact of the crime on the individual that\u2019s the \u201cunifying and common factor\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s somebody who\u2019s had their purse nicked from a bag in the supermarket or a burglary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s somebody who\u2019s been stalked or someone who\u2019s been subject to years of domestic or sexual abuse in the family, or somebody who\u2019s been randomly attacked like Harry was on the bus. \u201cIt\u2019s not the nature of the crime that determine how people behave. It\u2019s the impact. \u201cEverybody says exactly the same thing: Why me? What have I done? Did I provoke this? I\u2019m so frightened. All these mood changes. Is it me? Am I going mad? \u201cAnd also thinking that because of the feelings that they\u2019ve got \u2013 they cry for no reason, they get angry, they have mood changes, they can\u2019t sleep, they can\u2019t eat, they are suspicious, they are frightened. \u201cWhat we say is you are not going mad, it\u2019s horrible but absolutely normal what you are feeling. \u201cBecause the impact of crime, no matter what the crime, is the same for everybody. It\u2019s quite astonishing when you hear people talk about it \u2013 how similar everyone\u2019s feelings are.\u201d What is it like being a Victim Support Scotland volunteer? Elizabeth first volunteered with Victim Support in England around eight years ago when she retired. However, for the last four years she has been doing so for Victim Support Scotland in and around Perth. When she joined, she had three full days of training going through impact of crime on individuals and looking at case studies. They had talks and instruction about how they support people in court. She does a lot of support on the phone. She learned how sheriff courts work. Crucially, she said, Victim Support Scotland were very clear about defining volunteers\u2019 roles. Rather than being counsellors or therapists, it\u2019s made clear they are a friendly but trained listening person who\u2019s going to listen in total confidence and signpost to other organisations that might provide practical assistance where appropriate. A paid area co-ordinator will send volunteers like Elizabeth a referred list of names/telephone numbers and a brief note of what has happened to that individual. Her main job is to then phone people, introduce herself, explain what they can offer, then it\u2019s over to the individual if they want to talk. \u201cThe emphasis is on confidentiality,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much they\u2019ll talk to a complete stranger. It\u2019s very much their decision. There\u2019s no compulsion to talk to us. We are not investigating things. There\u2019s a lot of listening to what people are saying. \u201cBut of all the people I\u2019ve done over the years, very few have said no. Some will want to talk for one or two sessions. \u201cIt can be for 10 minutes or 40 minutes, as long as they want. Sometimes it\u2019s just talking it through, talking it out, and giving assurance that what they are feeling is horrible but normal. \u201cThey\u2019ll say \u2018I\u2019ve got your number, if I want to talk again I\u2019ll give you a ring\u2019. It\u2019s very much their decision.\u201d What range of crime victims has Elizabeth spoken to over eight years? Elizabeth has spoken to everyone from victims of domestic abuse and burglary to coercive control, sexual abuse and scam victims. The devastating commonality is \u201cviolation\u201d and an \u201cabsolute loss of trust\u201d that saps peoples\u2019 confidence. It comes as The Courier has been reporting how victims of crime must be the priority in any form of justice, but during parole hearings they feel silenced and ignored. While Elizabeth has had first hand experience of a crime being committed against her family, that\u2019s entirely co-incidental and she would encourage anyone with time on their hands to consider giving volunteering a go. \u201cIt\u2019s really worthwhile,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not demanding in the sense of time. I can arrange the telephone calls around my week. You have a degree of control over that. \u201cThe training for volunteers is very solid. You feel you have a solid base. You don\u2019t feel you are floundering. The support is also ongoing. The area coordinators are there to talk too if you feel things are getting difficult. They are very supportive of volunteers. \u201cThere\u2019s a good grounding in training and they are very clear about the role. \u201cSolving problems is not part of the job. You are there to listen and there are other organisations able to solve emotional and psychological problems. You can signpost people on. \u201cCrucially, you also feel you\u2019ve done something useful yourself!\u201d To find out more about volunteering with Victim Support Scotland, go to victimsupport.scot/volunteertoday", "summary": "A Perth-based Victim Support Scotland volunteer is encouraging others to support victims of crime in Tayside and Fife after her son and family experienced a lack of support.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/5009024/victim-support-scotland-volunteer-perth-tayside-fife/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/06/Elizabeth-Brookfield-of-Victim-Support-Scotland-volunteer-at-Perth-Sheriff-Court.-CR0048682_58357643-1mc7v0n24.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:31", "author": "Michael Alexander", "authors": ["Michael Alexander"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.232}

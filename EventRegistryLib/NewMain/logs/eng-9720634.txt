Sergeant Kyle Potter, who oversees Springfield Police's Crime Reduction Unit, said the investigation into the alleged thefts spanned three months. During the investigation, police officials witnessed suspected retail thieves leave a retail store after robbing it of high-priced Lego sets and head straight to Brick Builders.\n\n\"We would watch people go into the store with Lego and come out with cash in hand,\" he said. \"At that point we would stop people, we'd talk to them and they'd tell us exactly what they did.\"\n\nHe said a lot of the suspects investigators spoke with after the alleged cash-in trade were upset with what they got in return for the stolen sets.\n\n\"They were usually disgruntled on the amount of cash they got and when we talked to them, It was pennies on the dollars for what it was actually worth!\" Potter said.\n\nAfter the Crime Reduction Unit partnered up with the victims of the alleged retail crimes - big-name retailers -- they identified stolen items within Brick Builders.\n\nOn July 3, a search warrant was executed.\n\n\"We took our CMU and waited for store to open and presented the owners of the store with the warrants and that time we went inside and searched the place and found over 4,000 boxes of stolen Legos,\" Potter said.\n\nPotter said Henrikson was knowingly purchasing the stolen Lego sets and another Springfield Police official confirms Henrikson may have been instructing the suspects to acquire specific Lego sets from the retail stores.\n\nPotter said a majority of the suspects would go straight from Brick Builders after cashing in and taking their money straight to their drug dealers to acquire illegal drugs.\n\nJustin Williams is visiting from from Fort Worth, Texas and passed by Brick Builders on Tuesday when he heard the news of the massive bust.\n\n\"I mean retail theft has gotten out of hand nationwide, I never thought Legos played a part in it,\" he said. \"It tells me [about] the leniency on punishing people that are committing shoplifting and reselling to establishments that are aware of it. It needs to be cracked down and taken more seriously and have harsher consequences,\" he said.\n\n\"I was surprised as the amount of Legos primarily, but theft in general from these big retail stores in town that was most surprising to me,\" Potter said.\n\nWhen asked how local law enforcement will continue to fight the ongoing battle against organized retail crime, Potter said it's all about commitment.\n\n\"The most important thing to remember is we're committed. Springfield police is not going to stop,\" he said. \"We're going to continue to fight this fight and with the retailer partners in the community willing to help us.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

During the investigation, police officials witnessed suspected retail thieves leave a retail store after robbing it of high-priced Lego sets and head straight to Brick Builders.\n\n\"We would watch people go into the store with Lego and come out with cash in hand,\" he said. \"At that point we would stop people, we'd talk to them and they'd tell us exactly what they did.\"\n\nHe said a lot of the suspects investigators spoke with after the alleged cash-in trade were upset with what they got in return for the stolen sets.\n\n\"They were usually disgruntled on the amount of cash they got and when we talked to them, It was pennies on the dollars for what it was actually worth!\" Potter said.\n\nAfter the Crime Reduction Unit partnered up with the victims of the alleged retail crimes - big-name retailers -- they identified stolen items within Brick Builders.\n\nOn July 3, a search warrant was executed.\n\n\"We took our CMU and waited for store to open and presented the owners of the store with the warrants and that time we went inside and searched the place and found over 4,000 boxes of stolen Legos,\" Potter said.\n\nPotter said Henrikson was knowingly purchasing the stolen Lego sets and another Springfield Police official confirms Henrikson may have been instructing the suspects to acquire specific Lego sets from the retail stores.\n\nPotter said a majority of the suspects would go straight from Brick Builders after cashing in and taking their money straight to their drug dealers to acquire illegal drugs.\n\nJustin Williams is visiting from from Fort Worth, Texas and passed by Brick Builders on Tuesday when he heard the news of the massive bust.\n\n\"I mean retail theft has gotten out of hand nationwide, I never thought Legos played a part in it,\" he said. \"It tells me [about] the leniency on punishing people that are committing shoplifting and reselling to establishments that are aware of it. It needs to be cracked down and taken more seriously and have harsher consequences,\" he said.\n\n\"I was surprised as the amount of Legos primarily, but theft in general from these big retail stores in town that was most surprising to me,\" Potter said.\n\nWhen asked how local law enforcement will continue to fight the ongoing battle against organized retail crime, Potter said it's all about commitment.\n\n\"The most important thing to remember is we're committed. Springfield police is not going to stop,\" he said. \"We're going to continue to fight this fight and with the retailer partners in the community willing to help us.\"", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cnn_newsource@kion546.com", "name": "Cnn Newsource", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Meyer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Meyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_&_Noble", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barnes & Noble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoplifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shoplifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carnegie Mellon University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720634", "eventUri": "eng-9720634", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1755, "textEnd": 1761}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

According to the Springfield Police Department's Facebook page, a three-month investigation into organized retail theft led them to a business called Brick Builders where it found more than 4,000 allegedly stolen, and often rare, Lego sets worth over $200,000.\n\nBrick Builders was a third-party Lego store that sold sets and individual pieces to collectors. Lego sets command premium prices and have become popular enough that there are many independent stores operating across the United States.\n\nBrick Builders first opened in 2017 and gained a reputation as a place to grab hard-to-find sets. According to the Springfield cops, some of that inventory was stolen from local stores like Target and Barnes & Noble.\n\nAmerica is in a moral panic over shoplifting. In the past few years, retailers have self-reported that theft is up in their stores but the realities have been hard to quantify. Regardless of the real numbers, fears over shoplifting have caused cops to refocus on it. Which is what happened in Springfield, Oregon.\n\nBigger retail outlets have dedicated loss prevention professionals who monitor the store for theft and investigate crimes. They aren't cops themselves, but often partner with them. According to the Springfield Police Department, the Brick Builders bust began after they partnered with loss prevention staff from Target, Fred Meyer, and Barnes & Noble. They noticed people were stealing a lot of Lego sets from those locations and followed them to Brick Builders where they'd allegedly unload the merchandise.\n\nAccording to the cops, the thieves would sell the large and expensive sets to employees at Brick Builders, often for a fraction of their retail value. \"That store had every single thing you could ever want Legowise but you would pay premium prices. I only stumped them on two pieces when I would try to finish sets off. Any Lego fan could find a set they would drool over,\" a commenter in the Lego subreddit said in response to the news. \"BUT he was very difficult to deal with. I am a little surprised by this though. Not sure how he thought he wouldn't get caught.\"\n\nThe cops posted the haul on Facebook, posing in front of a mountain of Legos. The store's owner and one employee were charged with Organized Retail Theft and Theft I, receiving stolen merchandise. Both charges recently had their maximum penalties and purview increased in Oregon, partly in response to fears over increased theft in the area.\n\nThe Organized Theft Charge alone carries a possible two-year prison sentence. \"We all feel the impact of organized retail theft through the increasing cost of items we buy for our families,\" the Springfield Police said in a statement on its Facebook page.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_gault@gizmodo.com", "name": "Matthew Gault", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoplifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shoplifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_&_Noble", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barnes & Noble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moral panic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Meyer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Meyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/450467900_983580477131650_3180918652879296828_n-e1720618541839.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720634", "eventUri": "eng-9720634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Police Department said Tuesday.\n\nAmmon Henrikson, owner of the Lego-centric toy shop, is accused of knowingly buying the unopened sets from crooks who pilfered them from nearby chain stores such as Target, Fred Meyer and Walmart, according to cops.\n\nHenrikson may have even been instructing the suspects to snatch specific Lego sets from the retail stores, a police source told kezi.com.\n\nAmong the stolen items could be seen high-quality branded sets with kits for things such as the souped up DeLorean car from \"Back to the Future,\" the custom ambulance from \"Ghostbusters\" -- which goes for as much as $230 -- and the Millenium Falcon from \"Star Wars.\"\n\nDuring the three-month investigation, cops saw thieves rob stores of high-priced Lego sets -- then head straight to Brick Builders, police said.\n\n\"We would watch people go into the store with Lego and come out with cash in hand,\" Sergeant Kyle Potter told the station. \"At that point we would stop people, we'd talk

was pennies on the dollars for what it was actually worth!\" he said.\n\nMany of the suspects immediately spent the cash on illegal drugs, according to cops.\n\nDramatic drone footage shows boxes of

They claim that one store called Brick Builders -- yes, that's a store that sells Legos -- was buying sets that they were well aware had been stolen from other local retailers.\n\nThese sets were then allegedly purchased for well below retail value and then sold in the shop, with some of the thieves using the money they received in this transaction on drugs.\n\nThe store's owner, 47-year-old Ammon Henrikson has been charged with Organized Retail Theft and Theft I By Receiving, and if you think there were just a couple of little sets involved in this, you'd be mistaken.\n\nPolice say that they recovered 4,153 sets of Legos with a total value of over $200,000.\n\nI would never condone any criminal acts... but I can understand how this one happens.\n\nPeople love Legos. There's a Lego store at Disney Springs that has a line out the door every day of the year. Seriously, it looks like a night club and there's a bouncer that decides if you can go in and browse the models of the Death Star or Formula 1 cars (those are sweet, by the way).\n\nBut, if you open a store that deals exclusively in Legos that isn't a certified Lego Store, that's pretty niche. I mean, you have to have a certain level of obsession with everyone's favorite non-Smurf Danish export to go to a specialty retailer for them. So, it's a tough business, and any way you can increase your profit margins will be tempting.\n\nI would probably cut my Legos with Mega Blocks before I started buying hot sets from sticky-fingered junkies, but that's just me.\n\n\"We all feel the impact of organized retail theft through the increasing cost of items we buy for our families.

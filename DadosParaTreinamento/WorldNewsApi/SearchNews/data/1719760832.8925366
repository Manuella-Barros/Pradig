{"id": 225025196, "title": "Emerging Portrait of Judge in Trump Documents Case: Prepared, Prickly and Slow", "text": "A few months ago, a top prosecutor on former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s classified documents case stood up in court and told Judge Aileen M. Cannon that he was concerned about the pace of the proceeding, gingerly expressing his desire to keep the matter \u201cmoving along.\u201d Almost instantly, Judge Cannon got defensive. \u201cI can assure you that in the background there is a great deal of judicial work going on,\u201d she snapped. \u201cSo while it may not appear on the surface that anything is happening, there is a ton of work being done.\u201d In some sense, Judge Cannon had a point. Much of what judges do unfolds out of sight in the sanctity of their chambers. But at seven public hearings over more than 10 months, Judge Cannon has left an increasingly detailed record of her decision-making skills and judicial temperament.", "summary": "Judge Aileen Cannon\u2019s handling of court hearings offers insights into how the case accusing Donald Trump of illegally retaining classified material has become bogged down in unresolved issues.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/us/politics/trump-documents-judge-aileen-cannon.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/29/multimedia/29dc-cannon-wzqp/29dc-cannon-wzqp-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:11:08", "author": "Alan Feuer", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.209}

Back then I wondered if we'd just see it ported to more platforms eventually with all DLC, or have to wait for the Switch's successor for any sort of re-release. Maybe we'd get something like Persona 5 Royal that was built on the original, or something like Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse. I didn't expect Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. Having spent over 170 hours with Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance mostly on Steam Deck, but also on Switch and PS5, I can safely say that I'm glad Atlus handled it this way.\n\nI'm going to cover how Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance feels for those who played the original and also for newcomers who likely are going to experience Shin Megami Tensei V for the first time through Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. This review will not have any story spoilers for the base game or the new Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance route. I will also be covering how Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance feels on Nintendo Switch compared to the original, which platform you should buy it on if you're new to the game, and more.\n\nIt feels weird writing about Shin Megami Tensei V as a new release but here we are. After more than four playthroughs of the original, I wanted to keep playing more, but I decided to wait for potential ports or a re-release. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance isn't just a new enhanced port for current consoles and PC, but a dramatic improvement in just about every way over the original. After having beaten Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance twice and currently halfway through my third full playthrough, I can safely say that this is one of Atlus' best games for replaying. I just love spending time in the world, so what exactly was changed or fixed in this new version?\n\nBefore getting into the story content, if you didn't enjoy the open zones and general structure of Shin Megami Tensei V, that has not changed here. If you enjoyed everything the original had aside from its overall narrative (or lack thereof with many characters poorly developed or just tacked on), this Vengeance route is a huge improvement, but it also has many changes to the narrative. In a lot of ways, playing the original route in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance feels like an enhanced new version of a game with quality of life features and all the technical improvements. The new route in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance feels like a remixed take with new story content, new characters, lots of new voice acting, fantastic new music, new areas, changes to the original story, and its own different endings. Yes, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance's new route doesn't have just a single ending.\n\nWhen you start a new save in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, you get to choose which route you want to take soon after. Taking the girl's hand results in you being on the Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance route, while not taking her hand results in you being on the original game's route, but with the new features and quality of life improvements. If you play Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance on Switch, you get to carry over three demons into the compendium, some items, and additional items based on the endings you had in your save file. I laughed when three of my maxed out level 99 demons were carried over into Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance on Switch.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, my issues with Shin Megami Tensei V weren't that it wasn't in your face throughout, or that I wanted more social elements. My issues were that some characters just showed up randomly during important moments when you don't even remember they exist. One specific character seems to be super important, but I barely even remembered they existed until the ending of the game. The true ending in the original game also involved doing some missable quests that you wouldn't even bother looking into unless you were going to complete every quest it had. I've done every quest the original game had on Switch with the DLC, and really thought they should have handled many aspects of the characters and story better.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance's new route fixes most of this. Not only are there more interactions, but you actually see the cast grow with you and the world changing. Everything feels like it is part of a cohesive story that isn't full of holes anymore. The new character interactions, additional dialogue in older scenes, remixed bosses, changes to cut-scenes, and more all come together to make Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance feel like the actual main game. I even enjoyed having Yoko in older story moments with new voiced dialogue and more context to specific situations. Barring Yoko, the major new story addition is the Qadistu. I won't reveal too much about them, but they definitely served to improve Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance's story a lot, and I enjoyed every interaction I had with them.\n\nI can't comment on every ending Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance has, but the ones I did get I liked. I did like the change to going for different paths here compared to the original. Knowledge from the original does help in a small way, but be prepared to have Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance surprise you both mechanically and narratively.\n\nBefore getting into the visual and performance improvements and other technical details, I want to highlight some of the gameplay changes in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. I can't say for sure if this was only because of some of the new features, or because I knew every older map in and out, but I found Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance easier overall. Being able to save anywhere and using the sky view made exploration much less stressful here. Beyond that, the combat changes and additional negotiation options make Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance feel more complete. The only thing I dislike is the change to the Estoma ability that uses Magatsuhi gauge here instead of MP. You can't spam it like you could in the vanilla game, and I got annoyed at the amount of enemy encounters in one specific map here. The challenge mode is also a lovely addition because I enjoy taking on older bosses or enemies again. I didn't finish it all because it feels like a lot of it is meant for min-maxing.\n\nIf you're new to Shin Megami Tensei V in general, I think the new Vengeance route is basically better than the original in every way. I'm curious how people who play this route first and then play the original will feel about the story across both. If you already played Shin Megami Tensei V, playing the Vengeance route will feel amazing with the story additions, changes to existing aspects of the game, and all the new boss fights and music. Even if this release just included the Vengeance route and was only on Switch, I would've been satisfied. Thankfully, Atlus and Sega have brought Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance complete with the original route and prior DLC to all current and last generation platforms.\n\nVisually, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is a huge upgrade over the vanilla game since I focused on playing it on Steam Deck. Aside from the massive image quality and frame rate improvements over Switch, the new areas in the game are gorgeous. You saw some of these in the \"New Locations\" trailer, but seeing them in game at a high resolution is really something. When it comes to character models and new demons, I think Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is one of Atlus' strongest releases in years. It has an impeccable aesthetic that oozes the Shin Megami Tensei vibe I love from Atlus. This also carries over into its music.\n\nI've never hid the fact that Shin Megami Tensei V has a sublime soundtrack. I listen to it regularly even years after it was originally released. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance's new music feels like a blend of Ryota Kozuka looking to deliver something that lives up to Shin Megami Tensei V, but also reaching back into his Shin Megami Tensei IV vibe. The new boss themes in particular are amazing. I can't wait for the full new soundtrack to be released. Outside the music, the new voice acting in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is very good across the board. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance might be my favorite Atlus re-release yet, and I don't say that lightly.\n\nI've been playing it on Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, and PS5. On Steam Deck, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance arrives Steam Deck Verified. This isn't always a guarantee of something running well, but having done more than two full playthroughs specifically on Steam Deck, I'm very impressed by how Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance looks and runs.\n\nIf you play on a Steam Deck OLED, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance can hit 90fps (and even higher on both Steam Decks when played docked) in many areas of the game, but it isn't locked 90fps. At the default preset by turning a few things up and shadows down, I only saw it drop below 60fps in a few specific situations, but it almost always runs well above. The menus are capped at 60fps though. On my Steam Deck OLED specifically in handheld mode, it regularly runs at above 80fps even while exploring. The major area I noticed frame drops below 60 was the Fairy Village. You go there quite early on. Even the new locations hold up really well including the more open areas.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance on PC doesn't have 16:10 support, but it has Steam Cloud support and full controller support. If you aren't happy with the image quality at 800p, I recommend forcing 1080p for the internal display and playing at 30 or 45hz with some drops for the most crisp handheld experience. Speaking of handheld experience, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance even on its default PC settings at 800p on Steam Deck is a huge upgrade in visuals and performance over the docked Nintendo Switch version that rarely held a stable 30.\n\nI also played Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance on my 1440p 144hz display to see how it felt there. 1080p 60fps isn't really possible on Steam Deck. I also tested 1440p and 4K and you can imagine how that went. I stuck to playing at 720p even docked to see how the game held up at frame rates above 90fps. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance can easily hit above 100fps on Steam Deck at 720p even in some open areas. It just isn't consistent and you're better off locking it at 60fps or playing with a 90fps target and fluctuations. VRR would've helped a lot on the Steam Deck OLED's 90hz screen in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. You can play at a lower resolution of course, but I didn't want to settle for under 720p here.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance's PC port lets you choose button prompt options including an auto option, adjust keyboard controls, rebind controls for field and menus, and adjust a few graphics options. You can toggle ambient occlusion, motion blur, and anti-aliasing. The display options let you adjust screen mode (fullscreen, borderless, windowed), resolution (640\u00d7480 to 4K), toggle v-sync, and use a frame rate limit (30, 60, 90, 120, 144, unlimited). There are no additional options, and I was hoping to see draw distance and other features we see in Unreal Engine PC ports. Hopefully this can be added in a potential update.\n\nOverall, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is an absolute joy to play, and it might be my favorite console to PC conversion that I've played on Steam Deck alongside Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth for 2024. The load times are also very fast on Deck.\n\nHaving beaten Shin Megami Tensei V on Switch multiple times years ago, I was curious to see how this new upgraded version of the game felt on the same platform. There are now a few more post processing options even on consoles like anti-aliasing which you can toggle on. It just can't handle the game and drops from 30fps even indoors on Nintendo Switch both docked and handheld. I got used to it and put over 30 hours into the game on Switch OLED. If you played the original and enjoyed it on Switch, you will not have trouble playing this new version.\n\nComparing Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance to Shin Megami Tensei V has some visual changes. Even the FOV seems a bit different in the wide option the game has compared to the original. Beyond that, the new post-processing option toggles are not present in the original game either. I didn't have enough time to test every location to compare because I was focusing on the Steam Deck version for this review, but it feels like Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance isn't going to be much different in terms of performance compared to the original. If you are ok with that and want to play the new route on the same platform, this version is fine.\n\nOn the PS5 side, I can't remember the last time I was this impressed by the glow up a game has seen moving from Switch to PS5/Xbox Series X. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance looks incredibly crisp, runs flawlessly, and loads instantly on PS5. It even has PS5 Activity Card support.\n\nHaving played it on Steam Deck (main platform), Switch, Switch Lite, PS4 on PS5, and the native PS5 version, you might be wondering how the Xbox version is. Well, I didn't take a code on that platform because I pre-ordered it there already. If there's a notable difference between Xbox and PS5, I'll update this review in the future.\n\nAt this stage, the only reason I'd recommend anyone play the Switch version is if they have no other platform to play it on and want to exclusively play in handheld mode. The downgrades compared to current platforms are just too big right now. Obviously this wasn't an issue back at launch, but for those who have multiple platforms, keep in mind that every other version is better right now, and it absolutely shines on both Steam Deck and PS5. Hopefully Atlus can do an upgrade for the Nintendo Switch successor for those who buy Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance on Switch right now.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance isn't just the definitive version of a game I loved years ago, but one of Atlus' best RPGs in a long time. I always enjoy revisiting games I love every few years, but Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is just an incredible upgrade and release on its own. It is one of the best games you can play on Steam Deck in general, not just for this year.", "source": {"uri": "toucharcade.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TouchArcade"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Deck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steam Deck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_IV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei IV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saved game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "720p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handheld game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

Brutally hard and darkly atmospheric, the series fills a unique niche for gamers who want their JRPGs to have a bit more mechanical complexity and maturity than the average Final Fantasy or Pok\u00e9mon offers. At its core, Shin Megami Tensei balances strategic turn-based combat with monster taming and raising, giving players full control over their parties and often even character builds as they explore a hostile world full of ravenous demons and dense dungeons.\n\nReleased for Nintendo Switch in 2021, Shin Megami Tensei V was a change of pace for the series' storytelling and level design, opting for a minimalistic narrative and open world-esque areas that felt inspired by Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, respectively. Unfortunately, lackluster performance on the Switch coupled with an incredibly barebones narrative and cast left players wanting more - much more. Three years later, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is here to right SMT V's wrongs and the game succeeds in spades.\n\nRelated\n\nREVIEW: Unicorn Overlord Is An Early Contender for Game Of The Year\n\nUnicorn Overlord crowns itself as an early contender for Best RPG of 2024, netting Vanillaware another masterpiece in their impressive library.\n\nWhat's New in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance?\n\nVengeance Is Overflowing With Changes & New Content\n\nClose\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is the latest in Atlus' long line of rereleases that enhance its original games with new mechanics, story beats, and a fresh coat of polish. What Royal was to the original Persona 5, Vengeance is to Shin Megami Tensei V. Like Royal before it, Vengeance is a transformative upgrade that more or less makes its predecessor obsolete. Between new gameplay mechanics, an even larger compendium of demons, and a flat-out better story, there's really no reason to go back and play the original Shin Megami Tensei V except out of sheer curiosity.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is very generous with its changes and additions, staying true to the original game while offering a brand-new coat of paint. One of the most notable additions is the inclusion of Guest Party Members. Tao, Atsuta, and newcomer Yoko Hirohime all get to fight alongside the Nahobino at different points during the story. You'd think they'd only be around for a short while, but Guest Party Members actually stick around for a surprisingly long time. While they'll never be as strong as properly trained demons, they can pack a punch and help carry under-leveled (or underdeveloped) parties through difficult encounters. Yoko, in particular, is a genuine crutch during the first Netherworld and helps offset your team if you haven't done a particularly good job at raising demons.\n\nOverworld shortcuts in the form of Magatsu Rails make traversal a bit easier and more manageable. Every major Leyline Crossing tends to have a Magatsu Rail nearby that mitigates the need to backtrack. Just do some rail-grinding and skip half the map. It's a great way of simplifying exploration for anyone who's already played Shin Megami Tensei V to death. Considering you can now save anywhere, however, (a fantastic quality-of-life feature), rails don't really matter beyond just letting you circumvent major sections without needing to fast travel back and forth. Still, they help you reach out-of-the-way areas quickly and play off of the verticality in SMT V's level design.\n\nAccessible through the Leyline Crossing, Demon Haunts whisk you away to safe havens where you can talk to all the demons in your party, gift them items, and potentially net some stat bonuses without the need to level up. Even Guest Party Members have unique dialogue in Haunts, offering you deeper insight into their personality and helping flesh out the story at any given moment. The real boon is the added characterization of Aogami and Nahobino's relationship. It was rather one-note in the original game, but now, Aogami tends to offer extra context into every major story beat while occasionally giving you extra stat points to distribute to your protagonist. It's a win-win all around.\n\nSide quests were far and away home to the best narrative content in the original Shin Megami Tensei V. Although the story fell flat, you could always count on side quests to help add in extra details or expand the lore. The same remains true for Vengeance, even if the story is much stronger this time around. New side quests help expand the world even further, with the added benefit of actually fleshing out the supporting cast this time around. Just as importantly, Shin Megami Tensei's friends get a game-long side quest not dissimilar to Nocturne's menorah questline, pitting you against difficult bosses for the chance at a reward bound to excite series fans. Throw in some new cutscenes and it's no exaggeration to say that Vengeance manages to turn water into wine.\n\nA brand new character, Yoko Hirohime, is arguably the single most significant change in Shin Megami Tensei V. A major character in the Canon of Vengeance campaign (more on that later), she more or less steals the spotlight and exemplifies all the differences in Vengeance. Her presence alone leads to more dialogue alongside the main cast, she fights alongside you more often than not, and eventually results in the story's biggest diversions. Considering how underwritten the original SMT V was, Yoko's presence is nowhere near as jarring as Marie's in Persona 4 or Alex's in Strange Journey Redux. She fits in surprisingly well and quite frankly facilitates some of the strongest story beats in the whole game. Vengeance's plot is honestly better off making Yoko a member of the main cast.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance Gameplay Breakdown\n\nSMTV's Gameplay Loop and Premise\n\nFor anyone already familiar with the franchise, Shin Megami Tensei V fancies itself another Nocturne - a dense RPG with deep customization and a lonely, often oppressive atmosphere that's rounded out by an intentionally minimalist narrative and one of the best soundtracks to grace the genre. The difficulty curve is high and you'll net yourself a Game Over if your protagonist dies, so it's important to build your party around your strengths and weaknesses. Likewise, you need to take even random encounters seriously. This is not an easy game, and underestimating the wrong demon can result in death for your entire party.\n\nOne wrong move can tank an entire battle into the ground. You have to be ready to contend with status ailments, cover your weaknesses, and exploit your opponent's. The good news is that, unlike most RPGs, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance will often reward you for playing around with status ailments yourself. Buffs and debuffs are also non-negotiable the deeper into the story you get. Enemies only get harder and harder, and brute-forcing combat quickly becomes borderline impossible. Even the Casual difficulty mode will punish players who think they can just Auto-Battle their way through every fight. Learning enemy weaknesses, taking advantage of buffs and debuffs, along with playing smart are all basic requirements to guarantee your survival.\n\nRelated\n\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II Review: A Technical Masterpiece Weighed Down by Mediocrity\n\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II continues Senua's struggles against her own reality, but undermines its nuances for an Xbox epic that's lesser in design.\n\nPress Turn System\n\nClose\n\nVengeance uses Shin Megami Tensei's staple Press Turn battle system. In the Press Turn system, every party member adds an Icon during the Player's Turn which is spent whenever someone attacks. Missing or having an attack blocked eats up two Icons while getting an attack repelled or absorbed costumes every Icon. On the other hand, landing a critical hit, exploiting an elemental weakness, or passing to the next party member only uses half an Icon.\n\nEnemies also have their own Icons and will take advantage of Press Turn mechanics if they're left unchecked. It's important to treat every random encounter as a dance with death. The Press Turn system encourages strategic gameplay above all else. Normal attacks will drag out battles far too long when exploiting Press Turn can prevent enemies from fighting back altogether. Buffs, debuffs, and targeting weaknesses are an outright requirement to get through harder fights.\n\nUse a Spyglass to display an enemy's strengths and weaknesses before attacking.\n\nRandom encounters consist of a wide variety of enemies with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, potentially overwhelming you during the lengthier dungeons. It's important to keep a healthy stock of items on hand and to confront new enemies carefully, especially bosses. The average boss fight cannot be brute-forced and demands a legitimate strategy. Beyond successfully using Press Turn, there's a level of foresight required on the player's part to stay alive. Bosses will never be so random that a party wipe will be immediate, but you still need to be ready to counterattack patterns, or else you'll drop dead in no time at all.\n\nMagatsuhi skills are a mechanic exclusive to Shin Megami Tensei V which lets you turn the tide of battle into your favor. Once the Magatsuhi Gauage is filled - done by either taking damage, exploiting weak points, or factors based on your unlocked Miracles - you can trigger a special ability that does not use up a Press Turn icon. The default Magatsuhi ability makes every single attack a critical hit, but others can be unlocked through side quests, granting you access to double damage, extra EXP, or even buffed stats. The Magatsuhi Guage is a convenient way of giving you an advantage while still demanding you make an effort to play by the rules.\n\nDemon Recruitment\n\nKilling every demon that comes in your path is all well and good, but half the fun of Shin Megami Tensei is recruiting new demons into your party - and Shin Megami Tensei V has some of the most entertaining demon conversations in the entire series. Demon negotiation is critically important when it comes to party composition. You can recruit new demons into your party by simply talking to them and answering the correct responses. Triggering a conversation will result in demons asking several requests or questions based on their personality - in some cases, you might even have to answer a full-on quiz to recruit them into your party.\n\nMost demons aren't too hard to bargain with, but there's still a level of trial and error that goes into recruitment. Be ready to deal with occasional failures the deeper into the game you get. Every demon has to be treated differently and the RNG adds to a potentially hostile combat loop where the wrong answer can result in you losing all your Press Turn icons and getting barraged with a series of attacks. Fortunately, the more negotiating you do, the more acclimated you get to demon requests and the better you get at figuring out how to respond to a potential new recruit. Negotiating is just as important as battling and you should make an effort to recruit every demon you see if you want to build up a strong party. That said, just about any demon you miss recruiting can still be fused with the right combinations down the road.\n\nCustomization\n\nEvery time you level up, you get to allocate your protagonist's stats, allowing you to create a build that suits your play style. Demons don't have the same luxury as their stats are automatic, but this is where party composition comes in. By fusing different demons, you can create an entirely new party member whose stats and skills match the demons fused together. Any demon you fuse or recruit is also automatically added to your Compendium (basically Shin Megami Tensei's Pok\u00e9dex), logging every demon you've recruited and even allowing you to repurchase them later if they get fused.\n\nWorld Design\n\nClose\n\nShin Megami Tensei V's level design is open-world in nature, a major departure from previous SMT games. Every region of Da'at is a massive overworld with its own treasures, secrets, and optional bosses to hunt down. In this sense, the average Netherworld outright replaces dungeons in the core gameplay. For what it's worth, SMT V does actually have a few proper dungeons, but they're few and far between - considerably less common than your average Shin Megami Tensei game. The real star of the show is the Da'at regions, hiding their own goodies and making use of verticality for some soft platforming. These locales will be hit or miss with series fans, but they're not poorly designed by any means.\n\nEvery Netherworld has its fair share of Treasures, Vending Machines, and Mimans to track down. Treasures will more often than not unlock Essences which you can use to augment your Nahobino's (or demons') resistances and skills, while Mimans net you Glory which can be spent at the World of Shadows to unlock more Miracles - abilities that affect anything from battling to demon negotiation and fusion. Every now and again, you'll also gain access to a demon companion who will uncover secrets in the overworld. These range from Magatsu Rails to goodies to straight-up fights depending on your luck. You'll also find loose Magatsuhi, which do anything from restoring your HP, MP, or filling the Magatsuhi Gauge for battle.\n\nEnemies are visible on the overworld ala Shin Megami Tensei IV, but you can actually tell which demons you're going to be fighting ahead of time thanks to better graphic fidelity. This helps make Da'at a little bit more immersive while letting you prepare for specific encounters. Demon NPCs are littered around each Netherworld, offering context into the game's story or lore, or granting you side quests to complete. Every region also has its own set of Abscesses - optional areas with slightly stronger demons that unlock more Miracles once beaten. These can be completely ignored if you want to stick to just the story, but you'd be playing at a serious disadvantage and it's worth taking the extra effort to track down each area's Abscesses.\n\nVisit the Demon Haunt as often as possible to get easy stat buffs and learn more about the story.\n\nEvery area also has its own batch of Leyline Crossings, safe zones where you can save, fast travel, shop, or fuse your demons at the World of Shadows (this is also where you access the Demon Haunts, as previously mentioned). Early on, Leyline Crossings are the only way to travel between the Netherworld's many zones, but it doesn't take long to unlock the Return Pillar, which whisks you back to any previously triggered Crossing. Cadaver's Hollow allows you to buy new items, sell materials, or exchange Mimans for goodies. If you're making an effort to explore, you'll want to visit the Hollow often. The most important option in the Leyline's Crossing is the World of Shadows.\n\nThe World of Shadows lets you spend Glory on new Miracles and add Essences to your Nahobino or Demons, but most importantly fuse your demons together and access your Compendium. Every time you recruit a new demon and level them up, you can register them to your Compendium, allowing you to re-add them to your party at the cost of Macca. The more demons you fuse and recruit, the larger your Compendium grows. Fusing different demons together funnels their stats into a new monster and lets you select their skills, potentially creating an even stronger party member. It's important to fuse often, not only to expand your Compendium but to increase your own chances of success at battle. New demons are locked behind set levels, so don't expect to fuse high-level monsters without doing a bit of grinding in advance. If you're playing the Switch version and have a completed save from the original Shin Megami Tensei V, you can actually inherit your final party into Vengeance (but don't expect to summon them until endgame as they'll cost a lot of money).\n\nRelated\n\nREVIEW: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Catapults the Classic to New Heights\n\nThe biggest PlayStation 5 exclusive of 2024 is Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Here's how the eagerly anticipated Final Fantasy VII Remake sequel holds up.\n\nThe Canon of Creation & The Canon of Vengeance\n\nReplay the Original Shin Megami Tensei V or Embark on a Brand New Campaign\n\nClose\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance features two campaigns for its story mode: the Canon of Creation and the Canon of Vengeance. The Canon of Creation is Shin Megami Tensei V's original story, warts and all. It's slightly improved thanks to Vengeance's many inherent enhancements, but it's nothing special when all is said and done. The Canon of Creation is still a barebone storyline with minimal character development and almost nothing going on thematically, best played by anyone who wants a narratively unobtrusive experience or is simply curious about the kind of game SMT V was before Vengeance.\n\nThe Canon of Vengeance is home to the real meat: new characters, new cutscenes, and a campaign that actually makes an effort to develop its themes to elevate a mediocre plot into something truly compelling. The Canon of Vengeance starts out fairly similar to the Canon of Creation, with only a few simple changes here and there, but quickly spirals out of control by mid-game. By Shin Megami Tensei V's endgame, you're playing through a completely different experience that flips the Canon of Creation on its head. Of the two, the Canon of Vengeance is the clear winner, but it's admittedly hard to appreciate its many changes and revisions without playing the Canon of Creation first.\n\nMake sure to take her hand when prompted at the start of the game to trigger the Canon of Vengeance.\n\nThis is very much a best-of-both-worlds scenario - newcomers can still experience the original story while returning players can dive right into the Canon of Vengeance's remixed (and frankly much stronger) storyline. If you're only looking to play Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance once, though, do yourself a favor and make sure you play through the Canon of Vengeance. The Canon of Creation still leaves a lot to be desired and is only worth playing if you know for a fact that you're going to check out the Canon of Vengeance down the road and want a point of comparison before doing so. Otherwise, there's no reason to waste your time on the original campaign.\n\nVengeance Fixes Almost Everything Wrong With the Original SMT V\n\nYou'll Never Play the Original Shin Megami Tensei V Again\n\nClose\n\nThe original Shin Megami Tensei V has its fair share of problems, so it's genuinely amazing how much Vengeance manages to improve and outright fix with its tweaks. Atlus clearly took fan criticisms to heart. On top of more cutscenes and dialogue for everybody, new side quests help flesh out the main cast past their barebones portrayals in the original. Narrative minimalism isn't a bad thing, but SMT V's core cast felt like afterthoughts with little beyond the surface. Vengeance course-corrects, giving everyone deeper characterization besides a few loose personality traits. Don't expect the character depth found in Shin Megami Tensei IV or Strange Journey, but the main cast is now more in line with the quality of writing found in Nocturne\n\nGameplay-wise, Vengeance completely retools the RPG's level-scaling. SMT V's original release featured rather extreme level-scaling that made it basically impossible to defeat high-level enemies or bosses without excessive grinding. While this may sound like typical RPG fare, it's something the Shin Megami Tensei series always got around in the past by letting you play strategically. So long as you understood the mechanics and managed your resources well enough, low-level runs were possible. Vengeance tones down the level-scaling considerably, more or less eliminating the need to grind. If your party composition is solid and you know what you're doing, it's possible to stand a chance against the hardest bosses without over-leveling. This isn't to say the game is easy, though. I died more often in Vengeance than I ever did in the vanilla Shin Megami Tensei V.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is multi-platform this time around, but for those of you still adamant about playing on your Switch, rest assured that the game's performance is notably better. The original release suffered from frame-stuttered, a bit of lag at times, and lackluster visuals. Vengeance drops a new coat of paint on the game, stabilizing gameplay and refining the graphics. Make no mistake, performance sticklers should probably stick to the PS4/PS5, Xbox, or PC, but Shin Megami Tensei V is now perfectly enjoyable on Switch, both docked and handheld. You might notice some hiccups here and there, but nothing anywhere near as drastic as vanilla SMT V.\n\nIs Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance Worth Buying?\n\nVengeance Is a Must-Buy For Any Fan of the Genre or Series\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is a massive improvement over the original and absolutely worth buying for both new fans and anyone who's already played SMT V to death. Justifying paying full price for a game you've technically already played or beaten is a hard sell, but Vengeance is absolutely worth it. The amount of content present goes above and beyond what the original offered and completely redefines the game for the better. The already excellent gameplay is refined even further, the story goes from mediocre to actually fairly compelling, and all the new side quests and demons breathe new life into the experience.\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that this is Atlus' best revision to date, taking a 7/10 RPG and polishing it to near perfection. There are still some flaws, of course - the Canon of Creation will always leave a lot to be desired and the level design can be a bit hit or miss - but Vengeance redefines Shin Megami Tensei V with a vengeance. This is a JRPG with hundreds of hours of gameplay on tap and arguably the game Shin Megami Tensei V should have always been. Don't miss out on Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. We're only halfway through 2024, but it's already one of the best RPGs of the year.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance\n\n9 / 10\n\nIn Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, players navigate a post-apocalyptic Tokyo teeming with demons and divine beings. The protagonist, caught between warring factions, must forge alliances, recruit demons, and harness their power to uncover the truth behind the destruction. As they battle through a ravaged landscape, players face moral dilemmas and challenging choices that shape the fate of humanity.\n\nFranchise Shin Megami Tensei\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS5 , PS4 , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S , Xbox One , Switch\n\nReleased June 14, 2024\n\nDeveloper(s) Atlus\n\nPublisher(s) Atlus , SEGA\n\nGenre(s) JRPG\n\nEngine Unreal Engine 4\n\nESRB M For Mature 17+ Due To Blood, Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Strong Language, Violence\n\nPros Amazing gameplay loop Canon of Vengeance is a much better story than the original New side quests, demons, and cutscenes give the game much more depth Outstanding music and art direction New quality-of-life features are very welcome\n\nCons Canon of Creation still leaves a lot to be desired\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "renan_fontes@cbr.com", "name": "Renan Fontes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Level (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_(novel_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overlord (novel series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_encounter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Random encounter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Status effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canon Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overworld", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overworld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Underworld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dungeon crawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unicorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Experience point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanillaware", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanillaware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Esoteric_and_Occult", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Esoteric and Occult", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/yoko-nahobino-and-namaah-from-shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-06-", "textStart": 22699, "textEnd": 22706}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

The original game was generally well-received. However, it did get hit with some minor criticisms, especially regarding the human cast. Vengeance's new story mode tackles those areas of relative weakness and shows no mercy.\n\nIn this game, you choose whether to play the original story or the new Canon of Vengeance story. This mode brings in a new character whose very existences throws everything off-kilter. As in the base game-or Canon of Creation-an ordinary high school student stumbles into a desolate version of Tokyo crawling with demons. There, he is saved by Protofiend Aogami and the two fuse into a godlike entity known as the Nahobino. However, events in Canon of Vengeance take a sudden swerve when a girl called Yoko appears.\n\nYoko teams up with the player to fight demons and investigate the Netherworld they're trapped in. As a trained exorcist, she has her own magic to throw around. However, her upbringing has left her with her own baggage about how being selfless invites others to abuse her.\n\nAs the player's friend group begins to splinter, she's unable to keep her mouth shut. Her presence drives the cast to develop in new and interesting ways, but her cynical influence may not change things for the better.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance begins where most games in the series do: with the end of the world. In this case, the world technically ended about 18 years ago, when Tokyo was destroyed and recreated. God is dead, Lucifer has sown the seeds of a wholly new future, and the player has become a deity known as the Nahobino in order to survive. And the path of the Nahobino has never been more treacherous.\n\nThe organization Bethel is determined to fight demons and protect Tokyo, but it is certainly hiding something. The player's high school friends are being forged-and broken-under the pressure of supernatural war. And now a new faction of demons is slaughtering humans in service of its own goal. With danger on all sides, the Nahobino and Yoko must plunge headlong into a fight for their lives. The road to godhood will not be easy.\n\nThis is in many ways a far more human experience than the original release. The entire cast is far more fleshed out and their increasing desperation as the world falls apart around them hits hard. And while the demons are charming, the humans finally take center stage in Canon of Vengeance's tragic coming-of-age.\n\nYoko's subdued design and brusque attitude make her a welcome addition to the game's human cast. In a lot of ways, she feels more realistic than the other female characters. This extends to her inner darkness and disillusionment with society.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance takes a lot of inspiration from previous titles, especially Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne. However, the addition of Yoko feels like something new brought in just for this game. The franchise is no stranger to themes of corruption and frustration with the status quo. And yet Yoko's position as a 'saint' who's become disgusted with the way people try to take advantage of her is a refreshing one.\n\nHer cynicism clashes with nearly every other character, upsetting the existing dynamics and storyline. Whether the player chooses to agree with her grim perspective or deny it, the result is a tense and fascinating dynamic. Yuzuru, Tao, and Dazai also feel more messy and complicated this time around as their flaws come to the forefront. The game's atmosphere has never been thicker or more tragic.\n\nThe game features a delightfully eerie soundscape. And the voice acting is still solid, especially for the demons. The lovingly-detailed apocalyptic environment offers some truly spectacular views. Roaming through the desert, the ruins of Tokyo, and more exotic fantasy locales feels great. There's a whole new ward of Da'at to explore with its own visual style, too. And Magatsu Rails make backtracking much easier.\n\nThe biggest downside is that using too many rails to backtrack across half the map made me seasick. Also, some dungeons are still a pain to navigate.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance features turn-based combat and a complex system of elemental strengths and weaknesses. Hammering on a foe's weaknesses will grant extra turns. But if you hit an enemy with an attack it's strong against, you lose turns. Classic Shin Megami Tensei stuff. Every battle feels difficult and things can turn on a dime. One bad turn can be devastating, especially when taking on multiple waves of enemies.\n\nBeyond that, Vengeance adds lots of quality-of-life improvements to the base gameplay. You can now have human characters join your party and fight by your side... for a time. Demon Haunts are a fantastic addition to the game. I love the Shin Megami Tensei demons and any excuse to chat with them and give them gifts is a good one.\n\nYou can chain battles together in difficult Consecutive Encounters and earn greater rewards. Demon fusion is as delightfully complicated as ever. It's easy to spend hours assembling your team and filling out your compendium. And Vengeance offers two distinct game modes, Canon of Creation and Canon of Vengeance, with very different storylines. You can also replay previous battles in boss rush and challenge modes. And there's a ton of grinding required, as always.\n\nAll in all, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is an excellent revision of a game I already liked. It's still more sci-fi than horror, but a delightfully cynical tale nonetheless. And Yoko is a very engaging heroine in all her bitter glory.

Apart from being an improved version, Vengeance also marks the game's arrival to modern consoles after being a Nintendo Switch exclusive since its release.\n\nSMT V Vengeance is the definitive edition of the base Shin Megami Tensei V game. You will return to the Da'at as the Nahobino and experience a new story and meet new demons in this definitive release of the title.\n\nThe original Shin Megami Tensei V was released on November 12, 2021, as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. It followed SMT IV, which was released 8 years prior in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS.\n\nSMT V received a generally favorable review on Metacritic with a Metascore of 84. Critics praised the gameplay and story, and the improvements it made upon previous entries in the Shin Megami Tensei franchise. Criticisms of the game were focused on its graphics, but that's one of the fields that SMT V Vengeance is improving on. Some reviewers condemned the game's difficulty, and how it was too grindy. Despite these criticisms, the general consensus was that it was a good addition to the series - one that's being made better by this definitive edition.\n\nSMT V Vengeance Story\n\n\"When a grisly murder scene in modern-day Tokyo blocks our protagonist's walk home, an unplanned detour leaves him buried and unconscious. He awakens in a new Tokyo, a wasteland ravaged by apocalypse now called Da'at... but before bloodthirsty demons can claim his life, a savior emerges, and the two of them unite to become a mighty being, neither human nor demon: a Nahobino.\n\nWith newfound power, the protagonist ventures through Da'at, an enigmatic realm filled with mythical deities and demonic tyrants in constant conflict for survival. Searching for answers, the protagonist must forge his own path in a battle between angels and demons to dictate the fate of the world.\"\n\nSMT V Vengeance adds a completely new route to the game called the \"Canon of Vengeance.\" It is \"a dramatic tale of revenge by the fallen, centered around new characters and an enigmatic cohort of demons, the Qadi\u0161tu, who plot their own dark designs apart from the war of those who fight to maintain order and those who seek to defy it.\"\n\nThe original story, now called the Canon of Creation, can still be played in this version of the game.

The throne of heaven sits silent and unoccupied. An extradimensional civil war threatens to rip reality apart. And just to add to insult to injury, Mothman is waiting to shake you down for cash during a random battle, leaving you with no choice but to fork over thousands of bucks and slink away with your tail between your legs despite fielding a team of literal gods because you're still reeling from the poor choices you made in a previous fight and you don't want to lose half an hour of progress returning to an earlier save.\n\nUnlike, say, Shin Megami Tensei 4: Apocalypse's relationship to Shin Megami Tensei 4 on the Nintendo 3DS, Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance acts as more of an expansion than a sequel to the 2021 original. The move from Switch exclusivity to also launching simultaneously on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Windows PC means the game looks gorgeous and performs a great deal better on those beefier platforms. More importantly, it also includes a handful of quality-of-life features as well as a reimagined narrative with new characters and story beats. But don't worry if you skipped Shin Megami Tensei 5 the first time around, as you get to choose between the vanilla and updated plots at the beginning of the game.\n\nShin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance, at least on paper, stands tall among even the franchise's best entries thanks to a mix of compelling gameplay and stylish aesthetics. Every battle, the foundations of which rely on exploiting enemies' elemental weaknesses to earn yourself more turns for damage-dealing, health-healing, and status-effecting, plays out with the layered strategy of a chess match. Megami Tensei is unlike any of its genre contemporaries, sporting a combat rhythm made more exciting in Shin Megami Tensei 5 and, now, Vengeance thanks to the introduction of a Street Fighter-like special meter used for activating techniques that range from guaranteeing critical damage to improving all of your team's stats for a limited time.\n\nExploration in Vengeance is also far more easygoing compared to the original Shin Megami Tensei 5. Allowing players to save their progress anywhere rather than just at designated checkpoints and to utilize rail-grinding shortcuts for bypassing repeated trips through tough areas makes it so there are fewer opportunities for gut-wrenching game overs. That's not to say there's no danger at all, of course: Every battle, from boss encounters to those scary, random fights against Mothman and his buddies, carries the same weight. All it takes is one wrong move to see your entire turn disappear and your enemies given free rein to barrage you with their strongest attacks. Still, you'll rarely lose much progress upon being sent back bloodied and bruised to the title screen if you take advantage of the game's various quality-of-life adjustments.\n\nUnfortunately, useful safety nets like these only exacerbate my deepest criticisms elsewhere. Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance is so fun and user-friendly that, when combined with a narrative that's paper-thin and lightweight during even the most serious story moments, it's often too easy to overlook or even forget altogether the grim trappings the game should have inherited from its predecessors. Megami Tensei franchise heavyweights like Nocturne, Strange Journey, and the Digital Devil Saga duology balanced captivating combat and beautiful visuals with oppressive atmospheres that imparted the overwhelming weight of their almost Lovecraftian storylines. Imparting that weight effectively is not just about difficulty despite Megami Tensei games being known for their brutal, slogging campaigns.\n\nShin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance rarely treats the inherent horror of staring down ancient, supernatural forces that exist outside the realm of human consciousness with the gravity that the premise deserves, either through gameplay or in its dual plotlines. Put simply, the abyss blinks. Important characters die and are resurrected without so much as a double-take from the largely emotionless cast. Worldview-shattering revelations are given little room to resonate before the player gets sent off on their next mission. And rather than being characters who evolve naturally over the course of the story, allies and enemies alike deliver baffling soliloquies with all the passion of a middle school play.\n\nWhile it's common to joke about the trend of role-playing games like Final Fantasy culminating in climactic \"kill god\" moments, the uppercase God of Christianity is very real (and often very pissed) in the Megami Tensei mythos, existing alongside a cornucopia of deities, spirits, and other supernatural entities from just about every real-world religion and culture across the globe. No matter your belief system, there's a big difference between facing off against a clown-makeup-wearing magician elevated to artificial godhood and attempting to wipe the literal creator of all things from existence, but Megami Tensei's operated with this level of Vince McMahon-style hubris for close to four decades. It's because of this pedigree that Vengeance's failure to elevate Shin Megami Tensei 5's narrative shortcomings as much as it elevated everything else in the original feels like such a disappointment.\n\nI also can't wrap my head around the addition of the new Demon Haunts feature, which provides players the opportunity to hang out with the ghouls and ghosts currently in their squad. You can chat them up and even give them gifts, and they'll reward you with basic items and marginal stat gains. A diversion like this would feel right at home in Pok\u00e9mon, where you're encouraged to grow attached to your favorite pocket monsters, but it just winds up being confusing here. You shouldn't form attachments to the monsters in this game because you won't be seeing them for long, at least if you want to make any headway against late-game bosses. Due to Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance's slow experience gains and limited move pools, you need to treat your allies as fodder for fusing into bigger, stronger demons, or else you're leaving yourself open to copious ass beatings. Let's face it: The usefulness of cutesy franchise mascot Jack Frost pales in comparison to a late-game powerhouse like Maria, the literal mother of Jesus Christ. I learned to mostly ignore the Demon Haunt system after my first several hours with Vengeance and didn't feel like I missed out on anything important.\n\nI, like many others, used to describe the Megami Tensei series as \"Pok\u00e9mon for adults,\" but I no longer believe that shorthand is entirely accurate. Megami Tensei is Pok\u00e9mon for the ruthless, those able to exchange compassion and attachment for the cold reality of spiritual warfare. Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance's \"save anywhere\" feature, overworld shortcuts, and shallow storyline, however, result in a too-frictionless and therefore flat experience. The moment-to-moment gameplay may still be as fulfilling as any previous Megami Tensei game when it strikes a delicate balance between new and old mechanics, but Vengeance's overall lack of texture fails to live up to the important narrative themes of struggle, loss, sacrifice, and rebirth established by the franchise over the last 40 years.", "source": {"uri": "polygon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Polygon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_walker@polygon.com", "name": "Ian Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revenge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mothman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saved game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parallel universes in fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_encounter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random encounter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plot (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical element"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fF6RXbMCEMIFNePAnhQWx8_M7FA=/0x60:1920x1020/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25487061/smtv_vengeance_3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

However, the original Shin Megami Tensei V severely disappointed me in terms of its empty world, forgettable characters, bland storyline, and lackluster performance. Fortunately, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is the true definitive version, addressing all of my concerns and then some.\n\nIn some aspects, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is akin to what Apocalypse is to SMT IV, as it is a better game with a stronger story in the same world, but also unique at the same time. For the most part, Vengeance is the game this JRPG should have been from the start. I will go ahead and say it right now. Outside of 100% completing the JRPG, there is no reason to go back to the original Canon of Creation storyline.\n\nThe new Canon of Vengeance path feels much better in every single aspect. The start of the story is pretty much identical to the original plot, but with some neat twists. For one, you get new characters like Yoko who accompany the player from pretty early in the story. This is one of the best changes in Vengeance, as the game feels much more alive with frequent character development. Most of the plot has at least one, if not two, other people journeying alongside the Nahobino. They can even optionally fight alongside you in battle, Persona-style, if you so choose, but they don't have to.\n\nComments and interjections from party members like Yoko on the main plot points, developments, and even side quests are a welcome addition. They feel so natural, such as musing over whether or not I should've helped out a particular demon in a side quest. This makes replaying the almost identical first half of this JRPG so much more vibrant and thrilling. It didn't feel like trudging through this barren open wasteland without much purpose. I wanted to keep going to see how the story would change or what Yoko and others had to say about my choices.\n\nWithout delving into spoilers too much, the plot of Canon of Vengeance is solid from start to somewhat awkward finish. The highlight of the original SMT V for me was the first dozen hours or so. Adventuring through the initial Da'at area felt exciting and mysterious in the original, plus the more horror-like high school dungeon section afterward felt like the peak part of the story. Fortunately, Canon of Vengeance takes the best parts of the cast from that initial dozen hours I loved and included it throughout the rest of the game. You spend so much more time with all of the cast members in the main story. This even sometimes happens through limited-time side quests that flesh them out more.\n\nSMT V: Vengeance completely changed my perspective on certain characters. I won't spoil things here. However, I went from disliking them in the original to now loving them. There are even some characters I still hate, but with an even more burning passion than before because they had the proper time to develop their motivations better and earn that ire.\n\nEven better yet, there is a brand new area exclusive to Canon of Vengeance. Fortunately, it is also the best open-world area to explore as well. Players can now visit Shinjuku in Da'at. This area is absolutely massive. You start out in the gorgeous, purple-themed Shibuya, and you literally travel from that ward all the way to Shinjuku. The area is a refreshing break from the other areas. It is so detailed and just keeps going. In fact, it trades out the Chiyoda map in this story path, which I felt was by far the most annoying area in the original, so that made me happy as well.\n\nThe only real downside to the Canon of Vengeance storyline is the ending. There are two new endings to unlock in this game, and they felt a bit lackluster to me. They didn't necessarily move the needle as much as I would have liked, especially with everything else this version changes.\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay, though, we see the classic turn-based Press Turn system at work with some minor, but helpful, improvements. You pick to attack, use skills that cost MP, defend, and so on each turn. These tactical battles are just as challenging, freeform, and stylish as before. That said, there are a lot more ultimate Magatsuhi Skills to unlock and use in battle, and you'll want them, too. After all, the new Canon of Vengeance storyline felt much more challenging than the base game with its new bosses.\n\nThere is an early boss, for instance, who has a weakness to physical, but nullifies basically everything else. You would think this would make for a swift and breezy fight then, right? Just mash away the attack button or use physical skills and you'll gain extra turns, so it sounds pretty easy. Well, the boss makes up for its weakness with unbelievably powerful attacks and various status effects. These skills nearly obliterated my early party on the Normal difficulty. This continues through the rest of the game with each boss truly forcing the player to reevaluate their team and make use of the Essences to change resistances, skills, and the like.\n\nPlaying this game on the PS5 meant the battles were much smoother and swifter than ever before as well. The frame rate was steady no matter what I was doing, including exploration. Speaking of which, the exploration felt much more engaging. This is especially true with the neat quality-of-life features like new open-world shortcuts you can find and unlock.\n\nThis made me want to uncover every inch of each open map area and find every secret. I actually wanted to do every side quest as well, especially the new ones. Most of the newer optional content has quick, witty, and intriguing storylines worth checking out. There is one recurring side quest storyline following the Hare of Inaba wanting to stronger, which I adored. There are even more experimental quests where you can briefly take on the role of demons. One of my favorites was this puzzling and comedic whodunnit case.\n\nIn general, the demons have much more fascinating personalities than ever before. This is seen through the side quests and the new Demon Haunt area. This new location lets players interact with demons, give them gifts, and receive gifts in return. It almost feels like a very light bond system with the demons and other party members. This all added a nice touch. Even some of the previous DLC from the base game feels more naturally integrated into the world. This even includes the beloved Return of the True Demon side quest.\n\nIn the end, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance accomplished exactly what I hoped for. It took the messy base game, made it look and play better, and expanded upon every single aspect. This results in a polished and finally complete experience worth (re)visiting. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance reaches its full potential in almost every way possible and now confidently stands toe-to-toe with its predecessors.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance releases for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on June 14, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "siliconera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Siliconera"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cody_perez@siliconera.com", "name": "Cody Perez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canon Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shinjuku"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shinjuku"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Character arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shibuya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shibuya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dungeon crawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiyoda,_Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chiyoda, Tokyo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turn-based strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plot (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/img-9093-e1718118643112.jpeg?fit=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-06-", "textStart": 7001, "textEnd": 7008}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Everything from the combat to the life sim elements just work perfectly for me, and I'd struggle to think of any games I'd rather play when I'm looking for a chunky RPG to sink my teeth into. These games are technically a spinoff of the Shin Megami Tensei games though, which is another series full of monsters and masterfully crafted RPG combat with a somewhat darker tone and generally harder difficulty. Although I've always appreciated these more traditional RPGs when I've played them, it wasn't until Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance that I truly considered them all time greats.\n\nOur teen protagonist is having a normal school day, commuting through Tokyo and chatting with school friends. At least until a gruesome murder blocks his path and he has to change his usual route. This leads to our hero getting caught in a cave in, and waking up in a totally different world. In this apocalyptic version of Tokyo strange and dangerous monsters roam the land, and gods and demons of folklore struggle to live in harmony. An ordinary school kid would have no chance of surviving in this wasteland, but fortunately something happens which will change his life forever.\n\nA demonic saviour of this world with all sorts of powers decides to fuse with our protagonist, and turns him into a powerful being known as a Nahobino. Now with the power to strike down the demons who get in your way, you begin a quest to make your way back to the world you left, while also changing the world you're stuck in forever. While not nearly as story focused as a Persona game, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance has an incredibly intriguing setting that I loved spending time in.\n\nAs someone who has played a whole bunch of games in this series before, the thing that immediately jumped out as special about this entry is the exploration of the world. The wasteland environment feels just the right amount of open and sprawling, with all manner of secrets and side quests hiding around the corner of each crumbling building. There's just as much danger as there is loot though, so you'd better be ready to fend off pixies and mothmen.\n\nThe combat in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is just as well thought out and compelling as all the other SMT/Persona games, with a focus on hitting the weaknesses of enemies to take extra moves. Figuring out the weaknesses of each enemy and taking advantage of them is as compelling as ever, but that's really only the basic level of combat. Alongside this you have all sorts of powerful buffs you can cast which really change the game, healing abilities when things go downhill (which they absolutely will), and special moves that ensure maximum damage and crits for extra moves. Even with all these at your disposal though you can't win alone, and will need to recruit a few pals to survive.\n\nRecruiting demons is nothing new for the Shin Megami Tensei series, but it's just as good here as in past entries. Almost every monster you fight can be recruited by having a chat with them in battle, but they're all looking for something different. Arrogant demons might want you to respond by telling them how intimidating they are, whereas kindly fairies want to know they'll be teaming up with someone with good intentions. If you impress a demon accordingly they'll come with you and can join your party of four, which as I'm sure you can imagine is better than fighting solo.\n\nJust getting lowly demons from the open world probably won't be enough to handle the toughest bosses waiting in the wastelands, and eventually you'll need to fuse them together at the World of Shadows. Combining different demons and choosing which skills to pass down the generations is as entertaining as it is important for your success, and as long as your protagonist is a high enough level to control a new demon you're free to combine all the best supernatural buddies to create the ultimate team of beasties.\n\nYou'll need to make yourself stronger as well as your team, and this is done by either absorbing the powers of essences you collect to obtain new skills, or by spending glory on miracles. You'll find this glorious resource by scouring the apocalyptic wastes, and you can use it to gain all sorts of hugely useful upgrades. Everything from extra move slots to boosted proficiency in certain elements can be obtained as long as you've got the goods to do so, and because of this you'll want every bit of glory you can gather.\n\nNow if you played Shin Megami Tensei V before this upgraded version of the game then you're probably familiar with all this, but Vengeance has a whole lot more to offer alongside. The all new story route is entirely different to the original game (and we're talking entire new characters which are properly integrated into both the story and cut-scenes), and can be chosen from the start as part of an early cutscene.\n\nThere are also huge new areas, new demons, the ability to save anywhere (which is just so helpful), and a whole lot more in this wonderful package. There's even a new map option that lets you see a birds-eye view which can make exploring and collecting goodies so much better in certain areas. To call Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance the definitive version of the game is beyond an understatement, and it's just a delight for both new and returning fans. The volume of new features, bosses, and everything else added makes this one of the largest \"re-ups\" that I can recall Atlus ever doing, and yes, that includes Persona 5 Royal.\n\nAs Shin Megami Tensei V first released as a Switch exclusive, it wasn't the most technically impressive game (both visually and in terms of framerate). Getting to play the game on PC has eliminated all of those issues, and if you happen to be a Steam Deck owner you'll be treated to a silky smooth 60fps experience from start to finish. After playing the game on Deck I can't imagine playing it anywhere else, so those of you lucky enough to have that lovely handheld will have a great time.\n\nThere aren't many things to complain about when it comes to Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. The story isn't exactly revolutionary if you've played other games in the series, but the focus on combat means that's not a huge deal. Some will also be put off by the difficulty of the game, but with the option to pick new easier difficulties that's less of an issue than ever.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is a superb turn-based RPG that takes the series to new heights. The new additions to the game are both numerous and wonderful, the combat is as compelling as it ever has been, and the world is a joy to explore. RPG fans would be foolish to miss out on this instant classic, so make sure you don't.", "source": {"uri": "godisageek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GodisaGeek.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lyle_carr@godisageek.com", "name": "Lyle Carr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turn-based strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Deck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam Deck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handheld game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cutscene"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.godisageek.com/wp-content/uploads/Shin-Megami-Tensei-V-Vengeance-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The last time was the PS2's Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne, while everything else has been spin-offs. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, an updated port of the original Switch version, finally gives PlayStation fans a chance to try the other side of the Persona coin, and thankfully, it's a darn fine port. While the core strengths of the game are the same as in the Switch original, the weaknesses have been lessened or even removed.\n\nThere are two separate plotlines in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, but they start from the same place. You play as a regular Tokyo schoolboy who finds himself sent to a postapocalyptic version of Tokyo called Da'at. To survive, he's forced to fuse with a robotic being known as Aogami to create a powerful demigod-like being called the Nahobino. The two branches of the story, Creation and Vengeance, split based on whether you choose to release a girl named Yoko early in the story. Her presence changes the plot and events of the story, with Creation being the original Switch version and Vengeance being entirely new.\n\nThe easiest way to describe the new Vengeance storyline is that it's a remix of the original story. It hits a lot of the same basic plot beats, and it goes to a lot of the same basic places, but it changes the focus of the story. While the original Shin Megami Tensei V was plot-driven, almost to its own detriment, Vengeance is more character-focused. You spend significantly more time with the various characters and their interactions together, and the major changes in the plot tend to revolve around that. In comparison, you gloss over some of the world elements and some of the character segments in the original. Events will happen off-screen and are vaguely discussed, or characters may show up with new power or new forms that are only significant if you saw how they had attained them in the other timeline.\n\nThe result is that Vengeance feels like a companion to the original Creation storyline, rather than an equal choice. It feels much more like you're intended to play Vengeance after finishing Creation at least once; that's how the changes, fake-outs and plot changes feel most significant. In some ways, it's a more fun New Game+ mode, since you'll be going through a lot of the same areas but with new bosses or enemies. Vengeance feels like it was made to quell criticisms with the original game's plot. That also means it will feel very similar at times. The first area feels almost identical, so it doesn't put its best foot forward, but it rapidly improves from that point.\n\nThe biggest change to the combat system in Vengeance is probably the addition of passive skills for the demons, which is an absolutely fantastic change. Each demon now has an innate passive skill that alters how they -- or their allies -- play in combat. Some are straightforward, such as increasing the damage of a specific element. Others can be more specific in interesting or cool ways. For example, several \"theme\" demon types have passives that power up each other. The three weavers from Greek mythology get special abilities if they are in a party together, and cat-like demons have \"paw-to-paw combat,\" which increases the attack power of the party based on the number of cats in it. My favorite is that Forneus and Decarabia have a unique pairing of skills as a reference to Shin Megami Tensei III.\n\nThe passive skills count for both friend and foe, and they spice things up. Bosses with passive skills mean that some of them can require extra consideration, while allies with passive skills mean that lower-level demons can remain relevant far longer than they would otherwise. This change alone is enough to make Vengeance feel like an entirely new game compared to the original version. The penalty for there being a large gap in level between demons has also been reduced, which means \"weaker\" demons remain viable a lot longer.\n\nThere's also a much larger variety and selection of Magatsuhi skills. In the original game, the default critical skill was so powerful that there was little reason to use anything else, but Vengeance puts a lot of effort into making more things viable. Most demons get access to at least one powerful Magatsuhi skill; many get the ability to do incredibly strong heals or massive damage that also applies a more powerful \"debilitate\" effect. There are also combo skills that require specific demons in your party but usually have enough payoff to justify it.\n\nThe demons also get a lot more personality due to the new Demon Haunt feature. At most save points, you can choose to enter a demon haunt, which is a safe zone where all of your demons hang out. You can talk to them, and they have a shocking amount of dialogue, much of which is unique to them, so it gives them more depth. More importantly, you can befriend demons by fighting alongside them or giving them gifts. Make them happy enough, and you'll gain a bonus -- usually a random stat increase for the demon or a new skill. This means that if you keep a demon longer than expected, they'll gain a lot of free stat boosts and skills that can help them keep up past the point that their stats start to wane. In addition, there's a much wider variety of demon navigators to help in exploration, including a bunch of series favorites like Alice.\n\nAll of these combat changes play into the new difficulties and fights made available to the player. It's possible to level up to level 150, and that plays into the new virtual combat challenges as well as the Godborn difficulty mode. The combat challenges are special fights where you battle multiple strong opponents in a row; defeating them allows you to take them on again with much higher stats. Godborn applies that latter effect to the entire game, making sure everything hits like a ton of bricks. The DLC enemies from the original game are also included for those who want to take on the Fiends from Shin Megami Tensei III.\n\nThere's also a host of changes to the game to make things more convenient. Exploration has been given a big overhaul. Not only has the map been improved, but you can also use a new satellite view to zoom out overhead and get a better idea of the terrain. New Magatsu Rails are located all over each map and function as unlockable shortcuts, allowing you to quickly return to difficult-to-reach locations, so exploring the map becomes far easier and more comfortable. Likewise, the fog of war effect from Abscess has been removed, which makes finding and getting to them far less annoying. In general, a lot of the rougher edges have been sanded off.\n\nOne of the other biggest improvements to Vengeance over the original is in how well it runs. The original game, despite being designed for the Switch, suffered from severe frame rate issues and poor loading times. The PS5 version runs buttery smooth. There have been some updates to the visuals, so they look better than the Switch version, but the largest improvement is that it runs well. The music and voice acting remain solid; some new songs join the old, and most of the new tunes are genuinely quite good.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is easily the definitive version of the game. Almost every gameplay change is an improvement that makes the game more fun to play, and the addition of the new storyline means that even returning players have plenty of fresh encounters to experience.

Shin Megami Tensei V was the first game in the series to feature an open world, and developer Atlus pulled it off with panache. It felt like a natural transition given that the previous entries were purely segmented with dungeons and maps. It was the kind of success story that was begging for a good victory lap.\n\nContents A new timelineThis old dog has new tricksBut wait, there's more!\n\nNow, Atlus is taking its rightful double dip with an enhanced port of the game, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. The new version comes complete with new gameplay features, story content, and quality-of-life improvements. That's great news, because as great as the original Shin Megami Tensei V is, it has two critical flaws: its skeletal story and subpar performance on Switch. The RPG's intricate and thoughtful turn-based battle system, gorgeous art direction, and moody atmosphere were able to fill in the meat between the bones, but there was room to improve.\n\nThankfully, Vengeance addresses the original's issues to create a stronger package. The newly introduced story path is much more coherent, and its supporting cast plays a more active role in it. Best of all is that even though Vengeance is available on Switch, it's no longer tied exclusively to that platform. Your performance may vary depending on where you play it, but a move to PC, PlayStation, and Xbox finally unlocks its power. Shin Megami Tensei V was already one of the best open-world JRPGs out there, and Vengeance makes it even better.\n\nA new timeline\n\nIn Vengeance, players are able to choose between two story paths: the Canon of Creation or the Canon of Vengeance. The former is the one found in the original game, and the latter is a completely new one. The biggest issue with the original Canon of Creation storyline is how uninvolved many of the supporting cast of characters felt in the plot. Much like previous games in the series, the main character, Nahobino, is on a quest in a post-apocalyptic hellscape to reshape the world in their image.\n\nThe supporting characters usually only make their most impactful appearances toward the last hours of the storyline, where depending on which decision you pick, you get different endings. The newly added Canon of Vengeance has a reworked story that feels much more like a streamlined RPG narrative you'd typically experience. The Canon of Creation's story never felt like it went anywhere, and character motivations here were vague. That's not the case here.\n\nThe new villain faction introduced in the Canon of Vengeance, the Qadistu, are a more coherent antagonistic force to go up against. The supporting cast is much more involved this time around, and their motivations are clearer, making the new storyline easier to get invested in.\n\nThe Canon of Vengeance also has an entirely new explorable region, Shinjuku. This one replaces the third region, Chiyoda, from the Canon of Creation. Since most of the game takes place in a reddish desert setting, I really appreciated Shinjuku's drastic shift in aesthetic with its white sand instead, almost making it look like snow. Interchanging Shinjuku and Chiyoda between both story paths adds a layer of replayability, especially for those who've already made their way through the original release. It's a supersized RPG package now.\n\nThis old dog has new tricks\n\nVengeance's turn-based gameplay doesn't bring any huge overhaul from the original system. Those who've played its sister series Persona will feel right at home. You strike enemy weaknesses in order to gain extra turns, giving the battle system a puzzle-like rhythm. Players new to the series will find it much more difficult and unforgiving than Persona, however. The Shin Megami Tensei series really emphasizes party composition. Trying to find the perfect party of three additional demons to help take down an overwhelming boss is as satisfying as overcoming a boss in a Souls game. Thankfully, there are difficulty settings that can be adjusted at any point.\n\nThe biggest change to the gameplay system is the inclusion of human party members. Not only are there new demons to fight and collect, but the supporting cast of characters can also fight alongside Nahobino in battle in the Canon of Vengeance storyline. Here, Vengeance borrows a bit from Persona to take the extra mile in making the supporting cast feel even more involved.\n\nThere are smaller changes to the battle system that really add up. Allied demons now have innate special abilities, similar to the Pok\u00e9mon series. For example, one demon's ability applies a passive damage boost to the party's fire elemental attacks. New Magatsuhi Skills, which function like ultimate attacks when a meter is filled, are added too. Some can only be used with a certain combination of demons in your party. These two additions alone radically open up how I think about party synergy. Do I want to take advantage of these shiny new Magatsuhi skills, or maximize my damage output for one element?\n\nOne way to acquire new demon allies is through demon negotiation, where you talk to monsters during battle and pick dialogue choices to try to get them to join you. There's been some improvements there, including adding a fun little minigame where the demon will ask you to guess the silhouette of another demon. By guessing correctly, they'll automatically join you. Small moments like that freshen up a familiar RPG just enough.\n\nVengeance is well worth coming back for ...\n\nThere's a new consumable item called a Gold Card. If a demon asks you to give up some money, items, or HP in order to join you, you can use Gold Cards to counteroffer and they'll join automatically instead. While these are some welcome additions, negotiation still largely remains annoyingly luck-based, as choosing the wrong dialogue option could still cause the enemy to attack you or run away. Moments like that keep Vengeance humble -- there's always room to keep improving.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nThe incremental gameplay changes are astronomical, but the quality-of-life upgrades are key here too. For starters, you can now save your game anywhere on the map instead of having to trek all the way back to a save point. Additionally, the new Magatsu Rails scattered across the open-world maps let you zip around different points, making exploration much faster. Quest destinations can now be seen on the map, and it's color-coded to help easily distinguish between height elevation.\n\nI always found Shin Megami Tensei V's open world to be as impressive as ones found in its contemporaries like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Even though humanity was vanquished and demons took their place, it still felt lively with NPCs. The ruined buildings and cliffs offer so much variety and height elevation. All of these new quality-of-life changes to the open world make traversing it a smoother experience.\n\nSince Vengeance is on all platforms, more powerful systems alleviate performance issues found in the original release on Switch where it suffered from long load times and stuttering frame rates. There were also pop-in and draw distance problems in the open world where sometimes demons could appear in front of you at any moment. This was especially annoying if you were trying to avoid battles. The PlayStation 5 version, which I tested, has none of those issues. Load times are shorter with very few, if at all, performance slowdowns or frame rate drops.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V was already an incredibly solid open-world RPG in 2021, and the new Vengeance version is well worth coming back for so much so that it makes the original completely obsolete. The Canon of Vengeance storyline alone would be enough, but the gameplay and quality-of-life adjustments might make Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance perhaps the best entry in the series so far.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance was tested on PlayStation 5.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Everything announced at February's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase Shin Megami Tensei 5's new trailer shows off its new protagonist, release date", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_yang@digitaltrends.com", "name": "George Yang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canon Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shinjuku"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shinjuku"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turn-based strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dungeon crawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiyoda,_Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chiyoda, Tokyo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Replay value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xenoblade Chronicles 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World_Building", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/World Building", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Systems", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sm5.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Quality of life improvements like the save-anywhere feature enhance gameplay flow significantly. Despite the battle repetitiveness, SMT V: Vengeance offers an engaging challenge for hardcore JRPG fans.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is the latest release from Atlus, bringing back the story from Shin Megami Tensei V as well as a mostly new adventure for players to embark on. The new path, Canon of Vengeance, offers characters and enemies that weren't present in the original release, as well as a story that increases the stakes and helps explain the world around the protagonist.\n\nWasting no time, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance has players immediately select the story they would like to embark on by asking them if they would like to take the hand of someone likely to bring chaos and ruin to the entire world. The two options include Canon of Creation, which will take players into the familiar story of SMT V, and Canon of Vengeance, which includes the new story.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance\n\nPros New characters are dramatic additions that improve story New features like save-anywhere make the overall experience much smoother\n\nCons Battles get repetitive over the course of the new content\n\nNew Additions To SMTV's Story Deliver A Potent Punch\n\nYoko And The Qadi\u0161tu Make An Impactful & Stunning Debut\n\nClose\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance begins relatively similar to its original path. Due to a gruesome murder on his way home from school, our protagonist is detoured from his usual route and thrust onto a path that will eventually land him in a post-apocalyptic wasteland version of Tokyo, Da'at. Here, after coming face to face with death, he is rescued by Aogami. The two join together as one, becoming a fusion of human and proto-fiend known as the Nahobino, and thus the adventure to save the world truly begins. While the differences are not immediately obvious, small changes will begin to trickle in as things progress.\n\nRelated\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance Hands-On Preview: \"Undeniably Intriguing\"\n\nA new hands-on look at Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance's biggest changes, improvements, and additions that set it apart from the original release.\n\nWhile the majority of the changes to the plot come later on, there are a few recognizable differences within the first couple of hours of gameplay that will create enough of a unique feel that those who are familiar with the game will not feel as though they're reliving the same experience. The most prominent of these changes is the introduction of Yoko Hiromine. Yoko begins to affect gameplay right away, even going as far as to join your party very early on.\n\nThis is drastically different from what we've seen before with the introduction of Yoshizawa in P5R, who took a mostly backseat role until the end of the base material due to in-game timing restrictions, which caused her character to feel isolated from the story, rather than integrated into it. Yoko, on the other hand, immediately feels important to the storyline and is almost more prominent than some of the recognizable faces from SMT V, giving uniqueness to the new content right out the gate and real value to her character.\n\nThese Goddesses of Vengeance, spearheaded by their leader Lilith, are the driving force for the new plot.\n\nIn addition to new characters, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance also offers entirely new antagonists known as the Qadi\u0161tu, a group of female demons who have their own devious goals outside the traditional war of good and evil. These Goddesses of Vengeance, spearheaded by their leader Lilith, are the driving force for the new plot. They not only add new, drastically complex elements to the story, but also captivating boss fights.\n\nBattle Improvements Remain Overshadowed By Outdated Mechanics\n\nDespite The Quality Of Life Improvements, SMT V: Vengeance Struggles To Find A Good Flow\n\nClose\n\nOutside the changes to the plot, multiple quality-of-life improvements have been made to make the overall experience more enjoyable, with the most prominent change being the save-anywhere ability. The new save feature completely changes the game, allowing players to save their progress from the menu at any point. For a long time, Atlus has forced players to utilize pre-established save points, meaning that perishing often resulted in having to replay entire sequences. For a game that can already begin to feel monotonous at times, this feature drastically improves the flow of the game and helps to alleviate some of that repetitiveness.\n\nAnother improved aspect meant to speed up some of the repetitiveness, primarily when it comes to battling, is the auto-battle feature. This is meant to be used to help speed through some of the smaller encounters players will experience throughout their playthrough, which can be long and plentiful. However, even with this feature, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance struggles to find a pace that works well. While exploring the demon-infested areas of the game, the enemies start at a manageable level and eventually increase to the point of being overwhelming at all times.\n\nOn one hand, the argument can be made that it's great to have this much access to a variety of potential allies, since it makes fusing and utilizing essences very manageable, given players have the freedom to trace back and track down anything they like. However, on the other hand, the sheer quantity makes certain areas nearly impossible to stop and inspect unless players wish to be ambushed by hordes that respawn at a rate too quickly to justify just defeating them all.\n\nAll of this can make navigating a path on an already confusing map increasingly difficult. Unfortunately, this even makes one of the other more engaging aspects of the game, optional side quests, hardly worth the time at all. This is especially disappointing given the addition of a new region, Shinjuku, and multiple side quests to Da'at in the Vengeance storyline.\n\nFinal Thoughts and Review Score\n\n3.5/5 - \"Very Good\" By Screen Rant's Review Metric\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nOverall, while the new content is a wonderful addition to the SMT series, it is reaching a point where even that is not enough to overshadow the stiff repetitiveness of the battles. The turn-based system lacks a certain flare that other series, like Persona, have seemed to master. As a comparison to Atlus' other recent successes, SMT V: Vengeance has a noticeably outdated feel to it and thus the story content utilized here may have been better served as a new entry altogether with an entirely revamped combat system and structure, so that it truly had the opportunity to shine.\n\nHowever, Atlus certainly knows how to create an engaging challenge and an ending that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance requires a substantial time commitment and is geared more toward those in search of a hardcore JRPG, meaning it isn't going to be a hit with everyone. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance offers more than enough to encourage both returning and new players with an interest in visiting this new addition to the SMT lineup and is the definitive way to experience this grandiose tale of the powers of good, evil, and revenge.\n\nScreen Rant was provided with a Switch Code for the purpose of this review.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance\n\nFranchise

Being originally announced as a Switch exclusive in 2017, it suffered quite a few development problems, coming out only four years later. Now SMT V is back, with a re-release bringing a brand-new storyline, a few QoL features, and, of course, a PC/console release. But is it worth your time or is this only for hardcore fans? Let's head to the Netherworld and find out.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V brings the classic JRPG vibe that you might be familiar with if you've ever played a Persona title. Explore a huge location, solve quests, get into fights, and level up your character and his party. While the story begins in the same way as the original, with an ordinary Japanese student being transported into the Netherworld and fused with a god to form a new being called the Nahobino, after a few hours the game will start bringing in the new storyline.\n\nThis selection between new and old is right at the conclusion of the intro sequence, where the player can choose the original storyline or the new \"Canon of Vengeance\". The new story brings new demons to the forefront: the Qadi\u0161tu, four demonesses of the female variety which will cause us quite a great deal of trouble, as they will try to stop us from interfering in the war. While overall, the narrative does not really bring much new to the table for fans of the series, it will definitely provide enough new story bits (they are intertwined with the original, it's often hard to tell them apart) to be of interest.\n\nBut of course, that's not where the new features in Vengeance end. The Netherworld we will traverse, namely the D'Aat desert (which is supposed to be \"New Tokyo\"), is now much easier to navigate, thanks to more teleportation points, along with being able to go back at any time to the last \"save\" column we visited. Plus a ton of new sub-quests which bring up the total gameplay to 160 hours, if you plan on experiencing both narratives. For those fearing the difficulty would be sacrificed, have no fear; SMT V is still as hard as ever. You can never let your guard down for a moment and going back and killing demons to level up is still the main mechanic to progress.\n\nMuch like Persona 5 Royal did for Persona 5, no major gameplay features have been altered in SMT V: Vengeance. There are new demons to meet, for a grand total of 270 (also available in the non-Vengeance story), but the game is essentially the same experience you might have played back in 2021. The good news is that, since this release hits all major platforms, Vengeance also solves one of the biggest fans' complaints, namely the poor Switch performance of the game. Unfortunately, Vengeance does not offer any upgrade files or a way to port over your party from SMT V, even on Switch, so you will have to start over the game in any case.\n\nEverything else in the gameplay is pretty much intact, and anyone familiar with the series will feel right at home. Explore, get into fights with demons, befriend them to get them to join you, and use their essence to strengthen them while fusing their essences with your Nahobino form. Combat takes place in familiar turn-based format, with physical attacks and magic skills to perform, which will have to be used to hit the enemies' weak points. The Magatsuhi gauge is still also important; a power that you fill up slowly while fighting and that you can unleash when filled up for powerful skills. Bosses are quite frequent, with minor bosses being relatively easy, even when going in unprepared. Storyline bosses, like the Qadi\u0161tu demons, require quite a bit more planning.\n\nYou have the choice of deepening your relationships with your demons, plus gifting them items, which makes you access new spells and affinities. But of course, this is much less exciting than the friendship system in the Persona series, as you aren't really uncovering \"stories\" but just having conversations. Some of the demons' dialogue, especially when trying to get them to join our side, is quite funny, and horny at times, which is a welcome respite to the harshness of the deserted Netherworld.\n\nOverall, SMT V is the right entry point into the series for newcomers. Still, as mentioned, the new \"Canon of Vengeance\" story doesn't bring relevant narrative context to the table, sadly skipping on the possibility of providing new details on the human characters of SMT V. Instead, it prefers to focus on the new demonesses who are of course menacing and Luciferian, but don't have much of a personality otherwise.\n\nThis version of Shin Megami Tensei V does look incredibly pretty in its new Vengeance package and runs without any hiccups. The character design still shines through, especially now in higher resolutions, and the frame rate is stable in all situations. Also, let's not forget that Shin Megami Tensei V is still one of the best Atlus RPGs of the last few years, despite its development problems. Vengeance is definitely the best way to experience its demons vs angels story and exciting turn-based battles. If you can adapt to its different narrative flavor, from the more \"human\" and contemporary stories of Persona, you will find much to explore and discover.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance doesn't bring anything new to the table, not even with its new narrative, so if you have not \"vibed\" with the series before, this won't do much to change your mind. Still, considering Vengeance also combines all the DLCs previously available for SMT V, if you're a hardcore fan of the series, chances are your pre-order is already being processed as you are reading this. As for newcomers, well, with its strong combat, great graphical performance, exquisite soundtrack, and many demons to sedu- uhm, convince to join our party, Shin Megami Tensei V is simply a fantastic RPG all around.", "source": {"uri": "twinfinite.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twinfinite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Underworld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Experience point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teleportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turn-based strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Esoteric_and_Occult", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Esoteric and Occult", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review.jpg?fit=1600%2C900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

This is an enhanced version of Shin Megami Tensei 5, which was released back in 2021. This continues the longstanding tradition of Atlus re-releasing its games once they've had a few years to breathe. However, Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance stands apart in one critical way, and it's a major cause for concern.\n\nAtlus recently announced that it would be delisting Shin Megami Tensei 5 and all its DLC upon the release of Vengeance. This is concerning for a number of reasons, and it's a decision that absolutely cannot continue in future games. After all, if this becomes a pattern, it will put both the past and future of series like SMT and Persona in serious jeopardy.\n\nRelated\n\nShin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance Gets High First Review Score\n\nIn its first review, Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance receives a high score that fans of the franchise will certainly appreciate.\n\nWhat Shin Megami Tensei 5's Delisting Means for Other Atlus Franchises\n\nClose\n\nVideo Game Preservation is in Danger\n\nVideo game preservation has become a growing issue in the last few years. Access to physical media is increasingly limited, and some games are being removed from digital services only a short time after release. This has led to many games losing accessibility among general audiences. Other games may die on the vine completely, with no copies allowed to be sold, and no more copies remaining in circulation.\n\nThis is, thankfully, not entirely the case for Shin Megami Tensei 5 due to the game receiving a physical release. However, the slippery slope of preservation is one that is nearly impossible to climb back up from. If a game gets lost forever, it means a whole world of art and experiences gets permanently erased.\n\nThe Rocky Future of Shin Megami Tensei and Persona\n\nThe reveal of SMT5: Vengeance was not a surprising or unwelcome one. After all, upgraded re-releases both improve the experience of returning players, and bring in a whole new host of players who weren't attracted to the original. However, sacrificing the original for the sake of these re-releases would be a huge danger to Atlus' lengthy history of quality games.\n\nPersona 5 was a milestone of success when it came to Atlus bringing its franchises to a more mainstream audience. The enhanced re-release, Persona 5 Royal, kept the ball rolling with a wider release, improving its accessibility. However, while Royal improved upon its predecessor in many other ways, it would've been unthinkable to erase Persona 5 in its wake. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Atlus is doing now with Shin Megami Tensei 5 and Vengeance.\n\nThis decision is particularly strange given the recent release of Persona 3 Reload. Reload did not lead to Atlus erasing previous versions of the game. Instead, Atlus launched multiple Persona remasters to generate excitement before Reload was even revealed, and has continued to promote them after Reload's release. This was a great strategy for the preservation of Persona games, and a much preferable alternative to what is now going on with Shin Megami Tensei.\n\nAtlus Could Wind Up Erasing its Own History\n\nWhile updated re-releases like SMT5: Vengeance are welcome additions to Atlus' library of games, the original Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a game worth preserving in its own right. The decision to delist it is as confusing as it is potentially dangerous.\n\nThis is even more concerning for the sake of future games within Atlus' catalog. Persona 6 is in the works, and when it releases, it will likely get an enhanced re-release a few years later. If that re-release means erasing the original game, it would be an irreparable blow to video game preservation as a whole.\n\nThe ultimate hope is that this move with Shin Megami Tensei 5 is simply a fluke and not Atlus testing the waters. The future of Atlus' games is heavily dependent on its past. Many fans of series like Shin Megami Tensei and Persona got into them by playing older entries after a gateway like Royal or Vengeance. This is a vital door for the future of video games that, hopefully, won't be closed by Vengeance.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance\n\nAtlus' Sin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance is the definitive version of the Switch JRPG, one that also includes a new storyline.\n\nFranchise Shin Megami Tensei\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS5 , PS4 , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S , Xbox One , Switch\n\nReleased June 14, 2024\n\nDeveloper(s) Atlus\n\nPublisher(s) Atlus , SEGA\n\nGenre(s) JRPG\n\nESRB M For Mature 17+ Due To Blood, Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Strong Language, Violence\n\nExpand\n\nSee at Official Site See at Playstation Store", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "micah_warnock_estrada@gamerant.com", "name": "Micah Warnock-Estrada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Persona 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/j54qwj54qj54qj54q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 73, "textEnd": 80}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-06-", "textStart": 4440, "textEnd": 4447}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

It included new story beats and a whole new semester to explore at the end. But that's not what SMT V: Vengeance is. This iteration is essentially two games in one package. It is the ultimate version of this JRPG. Vengeance is brimming with many QoL features, more accessible combat, and two 80-hour routes to pursue.\n\nAs soon as I started a new game, I couldn't help but see Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance as a Persona 5 Royal situation. Initially, I expected this new version to push its new content almost to the end. It didn't. Vengeance smacks you with the new story beats in its first few hours and essentially changes most of the first chapters. It then ramps up a bit in the middle with new areas and encounters and changes the last half of the plot entirely. Despite the familiar characters, demons, and locations, I felt like I was playing a completely different game at every turn.\n\nWhen you start a new save, you can pick between the Canon of Creation, the game's original route, or the Canon of Vengeance, this version's new story. I went with the latter, of course. As someone who already made a hundred-hour journey in 2021, I expected the first hours to be the same. Instead, I was dazzled at the minuscule yet relevant changes. For example, the Jouin High School part changes drastically, thus modifying almost everything you experience at Shinagawa. This continues throughout the game as you progress through seemingly familiar locations. Encounters vary, dialogue choices change, and you even get new companions to join you in this demon-riddled version of Tokyo.\n\nBeyond the changes, what matters most in the Canon of Vengeance route is its focus. The heaven versus hell type of narrative takes a bit of a backseat and instead introduces its group of villainesses: The Qadi\u0161tu. A group of femme fatales with their own agenda wreaking havoc in an already dilapidated Tokyo. Sadly, that's as far as I can go because, let's face it: even the tiniest detail about a JRPG's story can spell spoilers. But let me tell you something: if you thought the stakes were high in the first game, wait until you meet this doom quartet.\n\nFrankly, one thing I loved about Vengeance is that it never lost its gritty and dark setting in the new route. I dare say all of that was enhanced even further. There were moments throughout the story, even in the first few hours, that made my jaw drop. Contrary to the first route, the pacing isn't an issue here. In Canon of Creation, I felt the narrative's pacing was a bit tedious. But not here. Every part is perfectly told. In Shin Megami Tensei V, I put my controller down to take a few breaks between certain main objectives. Meanwhile, on this route, I lost track of time while trying to learn what was happening.\n\nThe one thing I've always loved about Shin Megami Tensei V, which applies to Vengeance, too, is how it plays like an unhinged Pokemon. Fluffy creatures aside, I love being able to convince some of the world's most wicked minions to do my bidding. I may not have a loyal yellow mouse that calls lightning down on everyone, but I have a Succubus ready to whip everyone into submission. And you know what? You get attached to those hellish fiends, even more so with the new features that come with this package.\n\nTo begin with, the turn-based system didn't get a complete overhaul. It didn't shift to allow more player inputs in real-time or an ATB system like Final Fantasy. Instead, it improved upon it by adding new skills that require certain combinations of demons, increasing the demon Pokedex repertoire, and even giving you new temporary allies. It felt fresh to justify a new 80-hour grind fest but familiar enough not to confuse those who played the 2021 release.\n\nWhat I can tell you is my absolute favorite thing about Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance -- and this goes for newcomers, too -- is the fusion mechanics. At all times, I was playing a teenage Victor Frankenstein trying to create the perfect creature. Putting Demons into the grinder is more satisfying than it sounds. It's great to see all the skills you can make them inherit and the wacky combinations you can pull off. For example, one Demon that should be a healer turned into a glass cannon for my team. Meanwhile, a tank-like fiend became a physical DPS for my party.\n\nFurthermore, there are many things for the non-combat side of things. The one I enjoyed the most was the Demon Haunt feature. Since there isn't a social aspect \u00e0 la Persona where you can romance your human companions, Vengeance opted for a feature to let you socialize with your Demons. Yes, you can even give them gifts. And no, there isn't a romance option for the fan-fiction writers out there. Instead, as your affinity with them raises, they get stat boosts or new skills, which you can use to create the ultimate fighter.\n\nOn top of that, there is a plethora of QoL features that make exploring and playing much easier. Due to how challenging the game is, save points being far away was always an issue. Not anymore. You can save anytime and anywhere. Or the addition of Magatsu Rails. A sort of fast-travel option that takes you to a save point or secret encounters. Overall, Vengeance offers a balanced experience for everyone. It is still what die-hard fans want from the series, but accessible enough to welcome new players into these chaotic lands.\n\nAll Atlus games remain, at least for me, some of the most original anime-themed games in the market and some of the easiest to recognize. The eyes, the facial expressions, the gruesome creature design; it's all here. Also, since Vengeance is coming to modern platforms, the graphics look crisp. The textures pop out even more, and the framerate is quite smooth. Throughout my journey on PS5, I never experienced stutter or pop-in. I faced a few UI glitches, but most of them disappeared after reloading the game.\n\nBy now, we know that Atlus' soundtracks feel like the most random Spotify playlist. That's not me saying it's of poor taste. On the contrary, the soundtrack is marvelous! You have your combat music with techno beats and the occasional church-like choirs for epic battles. If there's one thing I'd say I didn't enjoy much, it is certain voice acting. Sometimes, it feels like there's no emotion where it should be. A plot twist happens meant to surprise everyone, and they act as if they had missed their bus. That's not on the voice actors but rather the direction. Still, there are only a few moments like that, and I can count them with one hand, so it isn't too bad.\n\nUsually, I'm a bit hesitant to play long games such as Shin Megami Tensei V again. Not because they are tedious. But because you only get to experience the shocking moments once. A character's demise, the thrill of beating a fearsome foe; you can't get that feeling twice. Or that's what I thought until Vengeance. With so many relevant differences, it truly felt like a completely new game from start to finish. And oddly enough, I felt even more attached to this iteration's story than the first one. It truly felt like a high-stakes adventure with difficult choices and nail-biting moments.\n\nOnce again, Atlus is proving its games are a masterclass in everything regarding JRPGs. The memorable characters, the music that sticks with you after each session, and the larger-than-life plot are hard to emulate, but the developers keep raising the bar with each release. Vengeance gives me hope for the company's future endeavors. And while I feel nostalgic for another Shin Megami Tensei game reaching its end, I hope this installment paves the way for a sixth entry further down the road.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julio_la_pine@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Julio La Pine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revenge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinagawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shinagawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shinagawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saved game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succubus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Succubus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turn-based strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Frankenstein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Frankenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femme_fatale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Femme fatale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Final Fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Shin-Megami-Tensei-V-Vengeance-Review.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

"body": "SHIN Megami Tensei V plays well on the Switch, but it always felt an ambitious game like that needed the power of a current-gen console.\n\nVengeance is not a remaster or a remake, but the version it brings to the PS5 and other platforms runs better and at a higher resolution.\n\nIt also comes with a new story path, Canon of Vengeance, added alongside the Canon of Creation path from the original release.\n\nThis fixes a common complaint among SMTV fans about the original version's lack of cutscenes and story content.\n\nThe new story path completements the original, but you will have to experience the two in separate playthroughs.\n\nShin Megami Tensei games are no walk in the park, and this enhanced re-released doesn't lower the difficulty.\n\nNew players coming to SMT from Persona shouldn't expect to defeat enemies in one turn, even when exploiting weaknesses.\n\nOne critical hit against your main hero is sometimes enough for game over, as losing your protag means your entire party is defeated.\n\nOn top of that, the game doesn't autosave, so you will may find yourself running to the nearest save point before each battle.\n\nKnown as leyline founts, these save points also let you recover your health, fast travel, fuse demons, and upgrade your Miracles.\n\nAnd you should be doing all of this quite often to give your party the best chance of succeding in your next encounter.\n\nTaking your time doing side quests and clearing an area before proceeding to the next one is crucial to leveling up your character and demons.\n\nThis cautious approach makes SMTV feel slow and cumbersome, and this hasn't changed in Vengeance.\n\nWhile the new release does add cool new story content, it might not be enough to have you replay the game, unless you are a massive fan of the original.\n\nIf you're a newcomer to SMTV and its quirks don't put you off, Vengeance is the most complete way to play it right now.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance releases on June 14,

Only a franchise as powerful as Atlus' obscure, cult-classic JRPG could make you pity a disgustingly rotten, unwanted green Slime. I couldn't get my fix for zany Demon dialogue and utterly unfiltered rejection in any other game. And you'll be pleased to hear that in crafting Vengeance, Atlus has injected the same wickedly fun cruelty that fans adore the franchise for.\n\nBut Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance isn't just the same ol' snarky Demons making you feel like a loser, now in crispier 4K quality. This isn't just a polished-up redo of the 2021 sensation. Instead, it's a full-on revamp. Countless quality-of-life features, impressive new Demons and characters, and a major story overhaul give Shin Megami Tensei V -- and Atlus as a whole -- a redemption arc.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V Vengeance is an enhanced re-release of Shin Megami Tensei V. The game thrusts you, an average high schooler in Tokyo, into a wasteland named Da'at, where you merge with a mysterious entity, becoming this half-human, half-Demon hybrid called a Nahobino. Now, it's your job to navigate through Da'at's chaos and unravel this angels-versus-demons tale.\n\nIn Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance, battles are governed by the Press Turn system, which is all about exploiting enemy weaknesses to snag extra turns. If you slip up, you lose turns instead.\n\nYou've got one big edge over enemies: A party of Demons. Recruit or fuse them to build a team of allies. While recruiting is cool, it's in the Fusion lab where the seriously addictive experiments happen. Mix two wild Demons to cook up your own custom-made creatures.\n\nAnd there are a lot of lab rats to experiment on, with 230 Demons returning from the original game and 40 fresh faces. While some are pretty forgettable -- looking at you, Nyam Nyam -- others, like Onyankopon and Anansi, are visually striking.\n\nDemon negotiation is a classic mechanic in SMT. To get them to join your crew, you have to get through a negotiation first. Depending on the moon's phase, they can become more or less demanding. But what's challenging is picking an answer that fits their mood.\n\nI was surprised by the Demons' cunning. You can start to win them over, but if you're not on par with their level, they vanish in a puff of smoke. They bookmark you for later, though, like a Demon waiting list, until you level up enough to be worth their time.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V Vengeance caters to all crowds with its difficulty options. Playing on Normal, I got sucker-punched and had to reload multiple times, skipping cutscenes to get back to the boss fight. It was like a never-ending cycle of rinse, skip cutscene, fast-forward dialogue, and repeat.\n\nThe RNG often decides to play dirty, and before you know it, you get hit with a boss's instakill move. GAME OVER.\n\nIn this difficulty mode, every battle feels like a high-stakes challenge. You've got to tackle every side quest, fine-tune every Demon in your crew, and memorize every enemy's tactics and weaknesses before tackling the bosses.\n\nI enjoyed the challenge, but it wore me out. Encounters felt like annoying interruptions, draining my stamina fast. It turned into a grind -- clearing all side content just to beat the boss and move on, only to do it again in the next area.\n\nSo, one night, feeling utterly drained, I decided to throw in the towel and switch to Casual mode with Auto-Battle on. Suddenly, those repetitive encounters practically took care of themselves, freeing up all my brainpower for exploration, collectible hunting, and Demon fusion.\n\nWith both difficulty modes available right out of the gate, SMT V Vengeance becomes a welcoming haven for newcomers. It can be a nail-biting, turn-based strategy epic or a laid-back Demon collectathon.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V's visual style throws us into a wrecked world that screams biblical apocalypse, and the soundtrack makes you feel every bit of it. Toshiki Konishi's signature rock-meets-electronic vibe sets the perfect mood for humanity's impending doom.\n\nBut the one thing I can't get over is the Demon cries. Each species has its own distinct sound, making them all the more unique and recognizable. Those over-the-top cries from Ippon Datara could give anyone nightmares.\n\nWhile the sound production in Vengeance is impactful, the visuals leave much to be desired. Back in 2021, SMT V looked good for a Switch game, but on next-gen hardware, it's painfully clear how boring Vengeance's unaltered backgrounds are compared to its revamped 3D characters and Demons. The game drags you through a desolate wasteland for what feels like forever and tries to distract you with giggling Mimans, random treasures, and chatty Demons scattered around. It's fun for a bit, but these gimmicks can't hide the fact the landscape is completely shallow.\n\nWhen SMT V originally dropped, fans had a lot to say -- and most of it wasn't flattering. But Atlus has picked up every piece of criticism and clapped back with Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance, its very own reverse UNO card, two years later.\n\nBack in 2021, the biggest critique of SMT V was the thin, badly paced story filled with flat characters. Atlus seems to have taken this personally and addressed it in Canon of Vengeance, a brand new game mode that overhauls the mid-to-late game events. The changes start right from the get-go. Now, Da'at has encounters that make it feel alive. Characters, both returning and new, join your party as Guests. Minor plotlines, even at the beginning of the game, have been reworked, making each arc feel less undercooked.\n\nAnd the developer didn't stop there -- other criticisms have been addressed, too. The map was hard to read? Atlus reworked it to highlight height differences. Tired of every Demon in the Overworld flocking to you? Activate Etoma Field. Flying fiends were annoying? Poof; they're gone.\n\nAtlus took every bit of feedback to heart and its re-do of SMT V feels like the studio's personal Canon of Vengeance. While I'm not entirely convinced this is the game the developer originally envisioned, with Kazuyuki Yamai's promises of tackling heavy topics like terrorism and Masayuki Doi's flashy ideas of riding on Hayataro back, I truly believe Vengeance is the best version of Shin Megami Tensei V that Atlus could deliver.", "source": {"uri": "dotesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dot Esports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cande_maldonado@dotesports.com", "name": "Cande Maldonado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_(Dragon_Quest)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slime (Dragon Quest)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cutscene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_over", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casual game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experience point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turn-based strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canon Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overworld", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overworld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nightmare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Esoteric_and_Occult", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Esoteric and Occult", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SMT-V-Vengeance-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Although 2021 saw the release of Shin Megami Tensei V, the new version, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, gives players the option of changing the original narrative a bit and a slew of graphical enhancements, but keeps the same killing or capturing of demons, monsters, and fae creatures that made it popular in the first place.\n\nThe newest game doesn't break the mold that has sustained its popularity, but developer Atlus continues to build and improve on the various aspects that have been bringing in fans for decades. It's a slow burn at first, but Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance has a definite charm that starts simmering from the very beginning.\n\nReturning once again is a party system filled with various creatures from folklore and fiction, alongside various human characters that can be added to or removed from the party. The only real downside is that these characters can take up a spot in your monster roster, so bringing them along can sometimes feel more like a chore than fun. But most of the time, the abilities they bring along are helpful for the section of the game in which they're introduced, even if their personalities and dialogue can be less memorable in some instances.\n\nFor example, if someone has a fire or charm spell, there is a good chance it will help a lot when dealing with most of the critters in that area. And with a story that shifts based on the first choice and the player's subsequent choices, there is a good reason to play through it more than once, even with all the turn-based fighting the game requires. The narrative gains complexity the further users progress in the story, but it sometimes feels like it's trying too hard to make a seemingly obtuse point. It's still an entertaining story, and best experienced without any spoilers going into it.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance Updates the Combat System\n\nThe grind has always seemed to be a staple of the Shin Megami Tensei series as well, and this Vengeance version doesn't shy away from combat. The game uses the now-standard method of fighting enemies using various elements until you discover which one they're weak against, and then spamming it until they die. Hitting a creature with its weakness also increases the amount of turns the player gets, another aspect of the series' combat that still hasn't changed much over the years.\n\nEnemies are usually found in groups of three or more on the world map, so initiating fights can sometimes lead to a chain of combat encounters. With the proper monsters or characters in the party, these moments are more trivial, but early on there can be moments that feel almost cheap, as players can find themselves fighting two or three monsters per round that quickly turn into three or four rounds in a row without a break.\n\nIndeed, the beginning of the game can be rough for someone who has never touched the series before. But anyone sticking around past a few hours will easily pick up the ebb and flow of the turn-based combat system, which can make the game much easier with just a little planning. Luckily, the game's save system is very generous in allowing saves almost anywhere on the world map.\n\nThose who didn't experience Shin Megami Tensei V when it was first released are going to find a lot to like visually on their first playthrough. Seeing demons relaxing or giving quests in the world is a neat treat, but this new enhanced version uses modern hardware to make each one look stunningly good. Both idle and attack animations feel well-thought-out and done with purpose. The running animation of the protagonist might look a bit silly, but it doesn't detract from the game in any real sense. A lot of the creature designs have been around for a long time at this point, so older fans of the series won't find them nearly as intriguing, but new players will have a daunting amount of information for each creature dropped on them from the start, along with their visual prowess.\n\nThe Updated Visuals are Very Impressive in SMTV: Vengeance\n\nThere is a lot of visual detail to be seen in the 3D models for the various creatures, and they are fun to interact with in both battles and when talking to them in the game. The protagonist's flowing hair in the demon worlds is a little distracting at first, but eventually, players will get used to its visual noise. The lone negative in the visual department is that, even with the new enhancements, some textures still don't seem improved from their previous look. These are mostly noticeable in large areas with the same textures repeating and can be a little jarring, or even ugly, when viewed from certain angles.\n\nA specific aspect that deserves heaps of praise is the game's maps, including its 'Sky View'. These overhead maps in Shin Megami Tensei: V Vengeance are a boon in a game that has a lot of area to cover and are greatly detailed in their design, with the Sky View being an incredibly useful 3D map-viewing tool. The map can sometimes become crowded with excessive information with all the main and side quest icons, enemy locations, and rewards strewn about, but the overall design and ability to zoom in and out make it extremely useful.\n\nThe Sky View is negated in some of the subterranean areas, but it is still such an overall help in the general scheme of things that it deserves recognition for its style and utility. It also doesn't give away how to traverse those hard-to-reach locations usually, so exploration is still needed throughout the game. Area designs are mostly interesting as well, but there are spots where some of the design choices don't seem to make sense to the overall feel of the world. Some puzzles fall into this category as well, but most of those are found deeper into the game.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance does epic music right, with its combat music being especially enjoyable. It sometimes starts off a little muted before combat starts, but quickly ramps up into epic beats after the first blows are struck and continues throughout the fight. Area themes match the music well, and the sound designs for combat attacks, monster cries, and tense moments all add up to a truly enjoyable auditory experience.\n\nThe game's voice acting is also top-notch, regardless of which spoken language is chosen. Some won't enjoy the English voice actors' over-exaggeration of certain situations, but that seems to be almost expected with translated games. There are also a few occasions where the yelling can seem at odds with what is being said, but saying it's a detriment would be overly harsh.\n\nThere has always been a certain level of seemingly basic complexity to the Shin Megami Tensei series and its off-shoot games, but it feels like this latest title has added even more layers to aspects of its battle and monster combination systems. Some of them do add depth to systems that may feel stagnant to older fans of the series, but the way these aspects are added at the very beginning in text bubbles doesn't allow for much learning unless players are dedicated enough to stop exploring and experiment. These become important in the more difficult fights, so more focus or even a brief tutorial fight would have gone a long way to helping create a better sense of what is required with the new systems.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance offers a lot for players, both old and new; an impressive enhanced art style, multiple story paths, and a definitive sense of the series progressing from what it once was. There may not be a ton of new things to justify purchasing the game again, but the additions that are here are excellent at keeping fans intrigued about what's going to happen next. Long-time fans will likely already know what they're getting into, as the game hasn't changed its turn-based combat and capture loops in a while. Still, those same fans have kept these games going until now, and Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is another in a long line of enjoyable titles in the long-running series.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance\n\nReviewed on PC\n\nAtlus' Sin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance is the definitive version of the Switch JRPG, one that also includes a new storyline.\n\nPros Creature textures look amazing Sky View should be in every game Exploring doesn't feel like a chore\n\nCons Added combat complexity feels excessive Its slow start may chase new fans away\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance releases June 14, 2024 for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

While its spin-off series Persona is much more widely known - and the two share a lot of creature and combat design - the SMT series takes things in a very different direction.\n\nEach game typically opens with some form of cataclysm overtaking Japan, and features a branching narrative depending on choices and alliances the player makes. With no day-to-day life component like Persona, SMTV instead focuses purely on exploration, recruiting demons to your team, and learning the ins and outs of a combat system that can turn against you quickly if you're not playing smart.\n\nThree years later, Atlus has stuck to its formula and released an updated version of the original game titled Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance. Much like Persona 5 Royal or the series' own Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse, Vengeance is an expanded version of the original title with extra features, quality of life improvements and an expanded story for players to experience.\n\nUnlike Persona 5 Royal, which made you play through the original P5's full story before reaching the new content, Vengeance takes a different approach. At the very beginning of the game, you are offered the choice of two different story paths: the Canon of Creation, which is the original branching story as told in vanilla SMTV, or the brand-new Canon of Vengeance.\n\nOther than the quality of life improvements, the Creation path remains largely unchanged from the original release - for anyone who deeply loves their RPG grinding and is willing to drop an extra 40-60 hours, playing through this story first is also a great way to understand the changes that happen in the Vengeance path. Of course, this is a big ask! Players can just as easily step into the Vengeance path first, as it isn't RELIANT on you knowing what happened the first time around.\n\nThe Canon of Vengeance starts much the same as Creation, with the same early story beats. While taking a shortcut through the Takanawa Tunnel in his hometown of Tokyo, your protagonist finds himself mysteriously whisked away to a world known as Da'at. He soon finds himself imbued with divine power to survive this world and becomes the Nahobino, able to recruit and control demons in his efforts to explore Da'at and fins a way home.\n\nNot all is as it seems however, and the Nahobino is quickly drawn into an ongoing battle between the angelic and demonic forces, fated to help decide the future of the world. Different from the Creation story, the Vengeance path adds a new character not present in the original game, Yoko Hiromine - another person mysteriously able to use magic to defend herself. Yoko is woven into all the initial story moments seamlessly, even adding bits of dialogue in many sidequests that make it hard to picture the story without her.\n\nAlso new to the Vengeance path are the Qadi\u0161tu, a team of four female demons with their own plans for the future of the world. While they are present early in the game, their effect on the story really only takes hold towards the midpoint of the game - at which point things quickly swing off the established rails. Given it has been a few years since I played the original SMTV, I initially found myself asking whether there really was enough different to warrant a new release, and the game very quickly cleared that up for me.\n\nAs you get further into the narrative, it becomes clear that Vengeance isn't holding the original game's story as sacred; characters' goals and fates change drastically over time, and just because someone lived or died in the Canon of Creation, doesn't mean the same is true in Vengeance. It's a different canon, after all.\n\nThe meat of this game is its combat system, and a lot has been added to fill this out. At its core, Shin Megami Tensei's combat is simple - you have a set number of actions in your turn, represented by icons at the top of the combat screen. You can extend your turn by hitting enemy weaknesses, which will light up one of the turn icons to be 're-used'. Hit weaknesses every turn, and your original four actions can become eight - but get caught using an element an enemy can block or evade, and you'll lose two actions instead. Every fight becomes a journey of testing the waters to see what works and what doesn't, so you can optimise your attacks in round two.\n\nYou also have the ability to speak to any of the demons you fight against, and attempt to convince them to join you; typically this involves answering questions and giving gifts of money, items, or even your health to convince them. Vengeance adds new wrinkles to this system, such as a quiz demons may give you to identify a demon's silhouette in a very \"Who's that Pok\u00e9mon?\" kind of minigame.\n\nDemons you recruit also now have unique abilities and passive skills, giving you more options in combat. A favourite change for me revolves around the auto-battle option, which in the vanilla game would simply make your party physically attack on repeat. Vengeance now adds an Auto-Skill Battle option, which will instead have your party automatically target enemies with the element they are weak to if known - which is an absolute lifesaver when running around the map to grind levels.\n\nAnd grind you will! Even across its multiple difficulty levels, Vengeance is not afraid to absolutely wreck you in a fight. Just like your party, enemies can increase their turn count when targeting weaknesses, meaning a misstep (or bad luck) can quickly lead to game over. Get used to seeing that screen, and make sure to save often - another thing made easier here with the ability to now save anywhere on the map, rather than having to trek back to one of the 'leyline fount' save points. This is a godsend for a game where even a random encounter can wipe you out unexpectedly.\n\nThe game's exploration has also had a glow-up, with new features to improve and expand the experience. In addition to the new areas added in the Vengeance path, new features like Magatsuhi Rails now appear across each region, acting as shortcuts the Nahobino can grind along from one point to another - which also make his strange ice-skate shoes suddenly make a lot more sense. These rails are often unlocked after travelling the long way from A to B on the map, and make traversal to tricky spots a breeze.\n\nWhen travelling with a navigator companion, some of the hidden item spots they lead you to will now instead unlock a secret rail, often allowing you to reach secret areas. An overhead view also allows you to zoom out and see the map area immediately around you, along with improved area maps that better show the height/elevation of different paths (a frustration of mine in the original SMTV). Enemy encounters in the overworld can now also chain together if multiple demons notice you, leading to multiple fights in a row with boosted rewards at the end of the fight. This alongside the auto-battle options make grinding for levels a much more enjoyable (and speedy) experience.\n\nOverall, Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance is all about building a more streamlined and player-friendly experience. While the game's difficulty hasn't gone anywhere, it feels like Vengeance is doing its best to make you enjoy that experience and remove as many roadblocks as possible. The new Canon of Vengeance story is big, exciting and entirely unapologetic about taking a different path to the original story - giving returning SMTV players just as much to enjoy as new players. Playing on PS5 rather than the original Switch also let me enjoy the game's world in much greater fidelity, and Vengeance takes full advantage of that to show just how gorgeous its huge maps are. While its combat is not for the faint of heart, the game's rich, branching story offers plenty to enjoy over multiple playthroughs.", "source": {"uri": "stevivor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stevivor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_gosper@stevivor.com", "name": "Matt Gosper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canon Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_IV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei IV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonlinear gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grinding (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Science_Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Science Fiction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://stevivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vengeance-cover.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Still, although this has been Atlus's modus operandi as far back as 2008 in North America with Persona 3 FES, it's hard not to look askance at the decision to launch the game for full price on the Switch without any upgrade option even if the Switch is the only place it'd be relevant. Though if you missed SMTV the first time around, this will be the version you get since the original will be delisted by Vengeance launch day, and it's still worth experiencing the game regardless.\n\nUpon starting a file, the Vengeance additions are immediately available as you have to make a choice as to whether to bring a girl into the world with you. Choosing to leave her behind will force you into the vanilla \"Canon of Creation\", while pulling her into the world will unlock the new \"Canon of Vengeance\" storyline. The key elements of the storyline are common to both routes, in that Tokyo is infested with demons and you are a \"Nahobino\", or human fused with a demon, who has to save Tokyo from destruction at the hand of a horde; whether that's a demonic or angelic horde or both is determined by choices made throughout the story in sidequests or main story dialogue options. Given that the same plot outlines apply to every Shin Megami Tensei main game and most of the spinoffs up to and including Persona 5, the broad strokes will be familiar; Vengeance is truly a case of the devil being in the details.\n\nWhen I reviewed the original Shin Megami Tensei V (which you can check out here) I ended up doing three full runs through the game and part of a fourth, so I leapt right into the Canon of Vengeance this time. Without spoiling things, I felt like the new character was reacting how I would have in most situations, and thanks to their addition I was able to eliminate one obnoxious enemy about ten hours of in-game time before they would go down in the Canon of Creation. And thank heavens for that, as their second boss fight in the original game was harder than some of the bosses I played in the notoriously hard Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne. The Canon of Vengeance does add additional boss characters of questionable motivations to make up for these changes in the story, so the pacing of the two storylines is somewhat similar.\n\nThe battle system in Vengeance is a turn based system that returns the series's trademark \"Press Turn\" mechanics. The party and the opposing demons have a certain number of icons with the party getting one icon per active party member, and certain harder enemies having multiple icons per member. The icons disappear as members take their turn, though some actions such as landing a critical or elemental weakness hit or swapping a member of the party in battle will allow an extra turn. Missing an attack or having an attack elementally blocked takes away two icons, which for most enemy parties will immediately end their turns. Vengeance adds a few twists to the system, including quest or random rewards that unlock new abilities for specific classes or alignments of demons that can be used when a \"Maghatsui\" meter fills, though the Nahobino's \"every hit is critical for that round\" Maghatsui move is still the default technique I used for putting huge damage into boss fights early on. Later on, it's worth setting up a team in a way to take advantage of some of the bigger ones, like having every skill that isn't the default physical attack costing one magic point.\n\nOne of the biggest differences in battles is also a key difference in the story, however; the preponderance of \"guest\" human characters. Early on, situations are frequent where the party consists of the main character that can't be swapped out, one or two humans, and the rest of the party filled with recruitable demons. Although the guests can't be used to swap the demon slot(s) that I found, they do have the ability to use items in battle. This means they can use inexpensive items to hit elemental weaknesses even without knowing attacks of that element or a \"Dampener\" to give an auto-block to the entire party. My playthrough for the review was on Normal difficulty, and it was frequently easier than the original review which was on the \"Casual\" difficulty level, especially since Vengeance also added a save anywhere option rather than tying it to locations on the map. The main character falling in battle still triggers a game over by default, but it's easier to get back to where you were, and normally party member demons using items had to be unlocked through the \"Miracles\" function about halfway through a first run at the earliest.\n\nThe classic demon recruitment and fusion systems are back for Vengeance, with some of the same great quotes when recruiting - though once the actual negotiation stage is reached, Vengeance has a somewhat easy to obtain \"Gold Card\" item that serves as an automatic recruitment if a slot in the party is open. There are more demons in Vengeance as well, and the demons now have a character alignment on the \"law, neutral, chaos\" spectrum which controls some of the special techniques. I haven't lost a demon as a result of being the wrong alignment yet, but if it does come up I won't be shocked. Another new addition to the game is a \"Demon Haunt\" which allows for conversations with demons and the party who possessed your main character in the first, with occasional items and stat boosts earned randomly while they're in your party.\n\nOne of the original statements about Vengeance was that although save carryover would not be available presumably to keep parity with the day-and-date release on other consoles and PC, there would be an option to carry over demons from the game. For me with the three clears, this became the three route-specific demons unlocked for finishing the original game; one for the Law route, one for neutral, and one for Chaos. The game also gave me ten items for leveling up the main character plus a full slate of stat boosting items, and the same \"free levels and stats\" for the demons. The former were used immediately, while the latter I'm sitting on since the demon level boosters only work until the demon matches the main character's level and I don't think I fused anything that would need an extra 10+ points in every single stat yet. Some of the original game's downloadable content also carries over; although the money/experience/Miracle unlocking options will be sold again according to the game's eShop page. What IS present automatically in Vengeance is the four purchasable quests that serve to unlock additional demons, one line of which unlocks nine demon options including the protagonist of Nocturne. Though there will be a couple of purchasable demon quests post-launch, that's all there is for now and the Deluxe version is only $10 US more than the base game at launch.\n\nPlaying Vengeance both docked and in handheld, I didn't have any of the pre-launch technical issues I had with the original, so if there's a day one patch I haven't come across any situations where it'd be technically necessary. More likely it would add the support for DLC and any extra difficulty options beyond the \"Casual\", \"Normal\", and \"Hard\" that were offered in the review copy with \"Story\" and \"Maniac\" difficulty for those who played Fire Emblem Awakening on Normal or Lunatic+. The new demon designs are solid and appropriately creepy, and Nahobino's hair is somehow slightly more fabulous than it was in the original. The soundtrack was good enough for me to buy from Apple originally, and Vengeance gives some great remixes that usually play when the bonus character is in the party.\n\nWe drew a lot of comparisons between the Partner Showcase and today at NWR between Vengeance and Persona 5 Royal, but they're not quite the same. For one, the PlayStation 4 version of Royal launched a year and a half before the game became fully multiplatform, while Vengeance is day and date. Still, having played both, if you held an Evoker to my head I'd probably say I think Vengeance is the better enhanced version. There's plenty of gameplay changes, and the new character is integrated better than the gymnast in Royal. If you missed Shin Megami Tensei V the first time, Vengeance is the best way to experience a great RPG.\n\nThat said, I've learned my lesson and will be waiting until the enhanced version for Metaphor: ReFantazio - which hopefully will come out on the Switch's successor.", "source": {"uri": "nintendoworldreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nintendo World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_tree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dialogue tree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Persona 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical element"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas and holiday season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modus operandi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_III:_Nocturne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(game_terminology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (game terminology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turn-based strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Esoteric_and_Occult", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Esoteric and Occult", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/media/66347/4/4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Despite positive reviews, the ambitious SMT 5 was inarguably held back by its launch platform of choice, with performance woes and other issues preventing it from earning the widespread mainstream recognition it deserved in line with its spinoff counterparts.\n\nAlmost three years later, Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance is far more than just a visually enhanced and more technically stable version of the original release. An equivalent to the likes of Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal, Vengeance is an almost-perfect entry point to Shin Megami Tensei for both JRPG newcomers and longtime fans alike. All the while, veteran SMT 5 players can re-enjoy the original and experience something completely new all in one package - truly being the best of both worlds.\n\nVengeance shines brightest on two fronts: the massive visual and performance upgrades over the original, and the abundance of extra content in the new Canon of Vengeance storyline. At its core, SMT 5's story remains the same in Vengeance. You start as a young high schooler who suddenly gets transported to an alternative post-apocalyptic Tokyo overrun by demons. Before being slaughtered by its inhabitants, you're suddenly fused with the mysterious demon known as Aogami to become a Nahahino - a powerful god-like hybrid who can also recruit, summon, and control demons in the typical SMT/Persona fashion. Alongside allies old and new, you soon join Bethel, a longstanding organization at the center of the ongoing war between angels and demons.\n\nWhile newcomers and returning SMT 5 lovers can still choose to dig into the original version's tale and religious allegory, the namesake Canon of Vengeance offers an even better 50-70-hour campaign of its own. Including twists like the new accompanying human character, Yoko Hirmomine, and the antagonist demon foursome called the Qadi\u0161tu, Vengeance quickly helps SMT 5 overcome its most notable weaknesses.\n\nThe original version's cast felt more cookie-cutter and in line with JRPGs of the past. In the Canon of Vengeance, however, not only do the Qadi\u0161tu bring new life to otherwise unimportant scenes with engaging boss battles, but Hiromonie's personality, combat capabilities, and role in the group dynamic make key story moments play out in wildly different and more satisfying ways. When all's said and done, SMT 5 newcomers can still return to the original version here to see how differently things play out, meaning Vengeance offers two distinct alternate-reality adventures.\n\nIt's clear from the jump that Vengeance is the glow-up SMT 5 always needed. Watching the game's dramatic cutscenes, battles, and exploring Da'at in a high resolution at 60fps, it's impossible to conceive of going back to the original. With added gloss on the semi-realistic character models, metal surfaces, glistening waters, shimmering sands, and even the duller ruins of both Tokyo cities, SMT 5's presentation has come a long way.\n\nYou can also expect full controller support, which works far better than mouse and keyboard when it comes to exploration. On the other hand, Vengeance's added quality-of-life features don't feel like they go far enough. While the new option to manually save at any time instead of just at fast travel points is cause for celebration, an autosave function would have granted greater peace of mind to those worried about losing progress to the game's toughest battles. Sadly, the demon recruitment mechanic can still be unnecessarily annoying if you enter negotiations with a full party, as you can only free up slots outside of battle.\n\nWhat's more, the game's humble Switch origins remain fairly obvious in parts. Even when playing on a 16GB Razer gaming laptop, which is above recommended specs, you'll still see occasional instances of pop-in and frame rate drops. Nevertheless, whatever immersion breaks you might experience will be quickly forgotten thanks to this upgrade's added cinematic appeal.\n\nNo matter which story path you pick at the start of your playthrough, Vengeance's turn-based combat is just as satisfyingly difficult as ever without threatening to make you pull your hair out. Persona fans will have the easiest time adjusting thanks to the familiar creatures, items, and mechanics, but the tutorials will quickly help even Atlus newcomers find their way.\n\nKeeping up the same comparison, the simplest way to describe SMT 5's combat is 'Persona on hard mode.' Along with grinding through side quests and experimenting with its affinity system to alter party skills and weaknesses, you're also encouraged to explore and platform around Da'at.

I've played SMT5, I played through all of its DLC, and while Atlus isn't a stranger to enhanced ports of its games, this whole thing seemed a little bit odd. Vengeance is the Persona 5 Royal of SMT5, and like Persona, it had a lot of heavy lifting to do to prove its existence worthwhile.\n\nBefore we dig in, I want to point you to our original Shin Megami Tensei V review, written by my friend and colleague Paul Roberts. I agree with just about everything Paul had to say in his review, and I think it's a great assessment of the game. It's important reading, too, because at its core, Vengeance is the same game. Sure, it's got a few extras here and there, a new story route, some QoL additions, and a few new monsters, but you're still getting SMT5 at the end of the day.\n\nSo let's quickly recap, then. SMT5 is a tough-as-nails turn-based RPG that takes place at the end of the world. After a series of killings strikes Tokyo, our protagonist wanders into a tunnel while following his school friends, and after a bit of rumbling, wakes up in the apocalypse. Demons and angels - which are really just a different kind of demon - are fighting to enact their own new world based on their own values and ideals. The protagonist finds an ally in this new world in the form of Aogami, a proto-demon who can merge with the protagonist to become the Nahobino and fight back against the world.\n\nThat story doesn't fundamentally change in Vengeance, it all happens in much the same way, but there is a new path that can be chosen at the very start of the game. Despite some of the marketing, which suggested it's only really the last act of the game that changes, there is a lot of new stuff happening throughout the story, right from the get-go. It doesn't drastically change things until later in the game, but it's interesting to see some things play out a little bit differently.\n\nIt's not enough, though, if I'm being honest. While there are some differences here and there, most of the new path plays out very similarly to the original game, and it takes a good 30 hours or so before you get to the big changes. If you have a high tolerance for sitting through things you've already experienced, then this will be just fine, but as somebody who rarely, if ever, replays games, there's a lot to slog through and the payoff isn't particularly worth it.\n\nThe gameplay is where things get a little more interesting. Yes, it's more or less the same game as before, with the same gameplay even, but there are little tweaks here and there that make it a lot more enjoyable. Playable human allies occasionally join your party, which is a very nice addition and relieves a little bit of the stress that comes with managing your posse of demons.\n\nDemons all get a unique passive skill, too, which makes each demon much more interesting -- you won't just be picking whichever demon has the highest stats and loading all your abilities onto that, each demon has its niche. There's some neat synergy with these skills too, like Angel's skill Blessed Melody, which increases the light damage of the entire team when in the active party.\n\nYou can also hang out with your demons in a new area called Demon Haunt. Here, you can increase your friendship with your demons by talking to them, which can result in them leveling up, gaining stat boosts, and giving you items. It's a silly little social element, but it's a nice break from the doom and gloom, and it shows off the very well-written personalities of the demons.\n\nSpeaking of those personalities, I've personally found it much easier to recruit demons. In the original game I always found that conversations with demons were opaque and frustrating to follow, but in Vengeance it's much clearer what the personality of a demon is, and it's much easier to intuit what the demon might want to hear. That doesn't mean you'll always be successful, but it takes a little bit of the frustration out of the experience.\n\nThere are some changes to the overworld, some extra side quests, and quite a few new demons sprinkled throughout the world, too. None of these change the game by any measurable degree, but hey, new content is new content, and when the game is working so hard to justify its existence, any little bit helps.\n\nThe difficulty seems to be much more even, without any major spikes like in the original. It's not that the game is easy, it absolutely isn't and you still have to spend every moment thinking and strategising, but if you're not running from every battle then you should be able to avoid any major grinding.\n\nI did actually notice one strange thing to do with difficulty, though. I was under the impression that Vengeance included all of the base game's DLC, including the Safety difficulty. That does not seem to be the case. I don't know if I'm missing something, if there's some kind of secret to unlocking it, or if it's the result of playing on a pre-launch copy, but there is no Safety difficulty in my menu when starting a game or when changing difficulty in-game. Again, this could be a pre-launch issue, so I'm not willing to slam the game too hard for it, but it's a weird choice if it's missing.\n\nOne area in which Vengeance is an obvious upgrade is in the performance. The original game on Switch had some issues with performance, particularly in docked mode. It was blurry, dropped frames left and right, and really seemed to struggle. You can mitigate this in Vengeance with a few tweaks to the settings -- turning off ambient occlusion, motion blur, and anti-aliasing helps make the experience perform in a much more stable way. It comes at the cost of visual fidelity, but it's worth the tradeoff for a more stable experience.\n\nI have a bit of an issue with the way Vengeance has been handled, to be honest. I don't like to talk about value and pricing in most of my reviews - value is different for every person and every situation, after all - but I can't really talk about Vengeance without touching on it.\n\nI'll be blunt: Vengeance should not be a full-priced game, at least not on Switch. I could give it a pass if there was an upgrade path, a $30 fee to upgrade the original game to Vengeance, but there's not, and as somebody who paid for the original game, I think I'd be annoyed at the prospect of paying again for something that's mostly the same. New path or not, extra demons or not, quality of life changes or not, this is a DLC expansion, and that's what it should have been.\n\nSo the question remains: does Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance justify its existence? I'd argue it doesn't. I mean it's a good game, SMT 5 always was, and it's better than the original version of the game. I can't fault it for what it is, but I can fault it for what it isn't. It isn't a DLC, and it isn't a big enough change to justify charging $20 more than the last game, and both of those things are frustrating. If you've played it before, you can probably skip it, otherwise, enjoy playing the best version of an already good game.\n\nRating: 4/5", "source": {"uri": "vooks.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vooks"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_brandt@vooks.net", "name": "Oliver Brandt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eschatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experience point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grinding (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambient occlusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spatial anti-aliasing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion blur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overworld", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overworld"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.vooks.net/img/2024/06/smt-v-v.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

There were a fair bit of criticisms about the original, and after spending dozens upon dozens of hours in the new and revamped iteration of Da'at, I can confidently say that, at least for me, those criticisms have been almost entirely addressed. On top of that, ATLUS delivered a brand new storyline, hence the Vengeance in the title. For anybody interested in a revamped version of a great turn-based RPG, look nowhere else but once again to ATLUS.\n\nFor those that may not know what Shin Megami Tensei is or what this rerelease means, I'll use Persona as the comparison (to my own dismay), as that is absolutely the more popular between the two. Shin Megami Tensei V is a turn-based Japanese role-playing game set in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, but instead of being more like Fallout, it's more like every religious sect merged and all of their deities, and, to no surprise, demons had begun slaughtering humans. If you're familiar with Persona, you'll be mostly accustomed to all the religious figures and creatures that inhabit this world, as well as the character building that fans of both series can't seem to get enough of. It uses a very similar combat system as Persona with the four member parties, striking and protecting various elemental weaknesses to gain an advantage, and recruiting new demons (or Personas, depending on the franchise) to aid you in combat, whether that be through different skills or for fusion into stronger demons. However, the core difference is what's known as the \"Press Turn\" system. If you strike a foe's weakness or land a critical hit, you will be given a \"half turn\", which effectively extends your total turns to a maximum of 8 total (1 per party member, with 1 additional per). Think of Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance like a Persona 5 Royal or equivalent \"definitive\" release of the game.\n\nI'm gonna get it out of the way immediately so the story qualms can be laid to rest after the response to Shin Megami Tensei V's original story, or depending on who you ask, a lack thereof. Also, despite the protagonist having a name now, as usual your name is not voiced. In case you're wondering, the canon name for the Nahobino is \"Kei Amemura\". The original story of SMTV didn't really give a lot of the human characters motivations for their stances and their appearances in the ending sequences of the game, and I know that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. I've heard complaints about people giving some small speech and disappearing for most of the game from even friends of mine that are massively into this franchise. After playing through the new Vengeance storyline, I can ascertain as to why that may be. If you played the original, you may notice that the story was very heavily focused on the demons and how they felt about Lucifer's reign and the state of Tokyo after the assassination and usurping of the Throne of Creation from God (Yes, that God, for those unaware of the themes held by Shin Megami Tensei).\n\nTo avoid spoiling anything, I won't go into detail, but the Vengeance route focuses significantly more on the human aspects and how we, the player, and our friends feel about the world at hand even before the demonic invasion. You can expect to get a lot more depth out of characters previously delegated to being as shallow as a puddle on the driveway, as well as getting to experiment more with them in combat. Basically, be excited to learn more about characters and get a deeper look into the questions about existence and motivations you might have for making a choice throughout the game. Oh, and expect new endings. Yes, plural as in multiple endings. ATLUS cooked up a whole new batch of endings for you to get at the end, and I am unsure if there's a secret fourth \"true\" ending like the true neutral in the original release. I couldn't even begin to fathom what the requirements are, unless it's still the secret boss I was too unprepared for.\n\nJust in case anybody was wondering, because I know I sure as hell had the concern about it, the story bosses are 95% all brand new. One of my biggest worries was that we'd fight the same bosses with new dialogue scattered in between, and I am so, so thankful that ATLUS did the right thing and gave us nearly entirely new boss fights. You'll still have your Hydra at Tokyo Tower, as that's almost a necessity for Aogami's memories, but don't get accustomed to it later on. I won't go into detail to avoid spoilers (and respect ATLUS' wishes), but I can count on one hand how many bosses are the same from the base game.\n\nI would be ashamed if I didn't discuss the new combat additions as well, because boy do they REALLY change how you can teambuild in this version. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance adds inherent abilities, or passive skills, to every single demon in the game. As expected by fans of the franchise, yes bosses have these too and will use them against you as much as possible. These can range from increasing your affinity with certain elements to higher ranks as long as a demon has a higher rank than you in them, increasing your damage based on the affinity of everybody in the party for specific elements, giving you extra turns for dodging attacks, and so, so much more. I cannot possibly go over them all in a review, so definitely experiment yourself and go through your demons' abilities. You can get some seriously stupid abilities and combine them with others equally as stupid(ly strong). It adds a surprising amount of depth to how you approach encounters, whether it be building your own team around a specific ability combination or making sure that a boss that's been wiping the floor with you can't make good use of their ability instead. There are some absolutely criminal boss fights if you do not come prepared, I can assure you that much. I do feel like it's important to mention that the weird level curves come endgame aren't super better. It doesn't feel as bad as the original, but it's still noticeable that enemies have weird level jumps.\n\nAdding on top of that, we got even MORE signature Nahobino skills. If you've seen basically any of the trailers, you have seen the new purple and gray Nahobino form we will be using during an unspecified part of the game. I was not expecting how insane the skills that this new form brings would end up being, but they are quite crazy. ATLUS seemed to go absolutely crazy with the original lineup of skills, but they really increased the bar this time. Whether you're a Magic user or a Strength user, or honestly really anything in between, ATLUS has cooked up some more insane tools to play with. I promise that you won't be disappointed in the new combinations you can make with your Nahobino this time around!\n\nAs we all heard recently, they redid some 80% of the soundtrack and have 84 NEW songs for the Vengeance story route. They remixed the battle themes for Da'at and some minor ones for sure, as well as giving us a bunch more. The music is phenomenal as always, and there's some seriously banger songs scattered throughout. Hopefully they come to streaming services before a 3 year gap like the first game's OST did.\n\nIt's hard to tell if there's going to be Day 1 DLC or not, as everything is (at least for the Steam page, as we reviewed this on PC) bundled with the Deluxe Edition, costing $70USD instead of the $60 price tag for the game without the deluxe contents. This comes with some new demon sidequests, more of the Mitama for farming like the base game DLCs, and if you preorder you get these unlimited use healing items that honestly aren't very useful beyond the first area. You'll get two new demons from the DLC, and all DLC from the original Switch release of Shin Megami Tensei V is included with the base game of Vengeance, so you won't have to worry about that. Feel free to take on the Demi-fiend and get absolutely flattened because he's THE franchise superboss.\n\nAll in all, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is a massive improvement over the original, boasting two full-length story modes with multiple endings for you to go through and explore. Combined with a new bunch of demons, new music, new mechanics, and much more, this is absolutely the definitive way to play this game. Other than some minor level scaling problems that still remain from the base game, it is a phenomenal RPG that encourages multiple playthroughs with plenty of unique build variety as vast as the player is willing to look. I genuinely cannot possibly recommend Vengeance enough to fans of turn-based RPGs, or even fans of Persona that may still not be versed in what SMT has to offer differently. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance releases for all major platforms on June 13th, and is well worth your money. Give it a shot, and I promise you won't be disappointed.\n\nSega provided us with a Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance PC code for review purposes.\n\nScore: 9.5 Related", "source": {"uri": "gaming-age.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gaming Age"}, "authors": [{"uri": "braden_czerwinski@gaming-age.com", "name": "Braden Czerwinski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megami_Tensei", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megami Tensei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical element"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucifer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://gaming-age.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SMTVV_Tao-Nahobino-Yoko.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 9025, "textEnd": 9034}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Persona 5 Royal is unmistakably the best version of one of 2017's greatest games, but asks the player to get through the base game's content again to reach a good chunk of the new (and fantastic) content. It's a tall ask for a near-100 hour experience and makes it difficult to recommend Royal to those who've already played through the original.\n\nShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance feels like a direct response to that. Redefining how ATLUS approaches re-releasing its biggest, most beloved games by fundamentally altering the game's approach to narrative. Despite being unable to remedy some faults of the original, Vengeance is the de-facto way to experience Shin Megami Tensei V for newcomers. What's more notable, though, is that Vengeance is worth a double-dip for those who enjoyed the original, offering a familiar yet fresh JRPG that improves on the original in almost every aspect.\n\nVengeance is split into two Canons, which are effectively two different narrative routes. One is the Canon of Creation, which is the same story as the original game, where the Canon of Vengeance tells an alternate tale with new characters, areas, boss fights, and much more. While it's nice to have the original story there for posterity's sake, the Canon of Vengeance route is far superior. It's clear that ATLUS recognised the original's narrative shortcomings were too far rooted in its premise and the way it handles its characters, likely prompting the inclusion of this alternate experience.\n\nThe Canon of Vengeance starts almost identically to Canon of Creation. Strange happenings are occurring throughout Tokyo. Rumours of demons and supernatural beings are spreading like wildfire. It's amidst this climate that our protagonist is pulled into Da'at, a hellish landscape in place of Tokyo. Shortly after arriving, you'll make contact with a Proto-Fiend named Aogami, fusing together to become a divine being known as a Nahobino. It's still a brilliant introduction that lures you in with mystery and oppressive atmosphere.\n\nIt's only once you venture deeper into Da'at that things start changing. You'll encounter Yoko Hiromine, a demon exorcist from Saint Marina's Academy. Much of the focus in the Canon of Vengeance route is focused on Yoko, whose outlook and perspectives on life often clash with that of the original cast. She sheds new light and moral intricacies onto plot elements returning from the original, and brand new ones brought in with Vengeance.\n\nThe other key piece of the puzzle in Canon of Vengeance are the Qadi\u0161tu. You'll gradually encounter the members of the Qadi\u0161tu as you explore Da'at, each one alluding to grander plans for our cast of characters and Tokyo at large. The Qadi\u0161tu are a much more fascinating force to contend with in comparison to the antagonists of the Canon of Creation. Like Yoko, they provide alternate perspectives on the world of Gods and demons and deeply tie into Vengeance's broader themes of revenge and rebirth.\n\nWhile the shift in focus to Yoko and the Qadi\u0161tu are more than welcome, some of the underwhelming plot elements from the original game are still here. The issue of rapid character development feels exacerbated here in the attempt to share the spotlight between all the moving parts that the Canon of Vengeance brings. Even though I saw these things coming, it still feels like they happen too fast, and are based around events you don't get to see on-screen.\n\nIt ends up making for a narrative where the new stuff is great, but some returning elements retain their flaws. The only area I feel this isn't the case is in Vengeance's exploration of morality and the law/chaos/neutral alignments that the series is known for. Shin Megami Tensei V is infamous for its handlings of this idea, boiling down certain alignments to good and evil in underwhelming fashion. This is remedied through Yoko and the Qadi\u0161tu, who are firmly planted in the moral greys between the agents of heaven and hell. It's a refreshing change, and one seen frequently given Yoko's prominence in the Canon of Vengeance route.\n\nWhile narrative has been substantially reworked in Vengeance as a whole, gameplay is relatively untouched, opting for small iterative changes that build on the strengths of what's already there. This is a good call for the most part, as Shin Megami Tensei V already has some best-in-class combat and a novel approach to open-world design that keep things engaging. There are a few pain points that haven't been addressed, though, which stand out a bit more now given other improvements.\n\nCombat is still deliciously challenging on higher difficulties, forcing you to make use of every tool in your arsenal to exploit demon weaknesses to net extra turns in battle. The inclusion of new demons and skills in Vengeance means there are even more ways to build out your Nahobino and team composition. Additionally, characters that accompany you in the story can also be used as party members, which is a fantastic change that gives them more life and a deeper sense of place in the world.\n\nThe combat system shines even more inside of the Canon of Vengeance's new bosses. They are wildly varied in visual and gameplay design, often forcing you to make ample use of items and skills in tandem to come out on top. There's a few real highlights in the back half of the game that I won't spoil here, but the way they test your management of different targets and juggling multiple affinities is thrilling and rewarding.\n\nThe Magatsuhi system also makes a return here. For the unfamiliar, Magatsuhi is charged through combat and by collecting Magatsuhi in the open-world. Once full, you can unleash a powerful Magatsuhi ability that can change the tide of battle very quickly. There are also a bunch of new Magatsuhi abilities exclusive to specific demon or alignment combinations, imploring you further to think deeply about the demons you bring with you into battle.\n\nThe only real problem with this system, is that the starting Magatsuhi ability you get is far and away the best one. This was an issue in the original game that rears its head in Vengeance. There is often very little reason to use any other skill, because guaranteed critical hits are so valuable within Shin Megami Tensei's combat system. If you're also trying to bring certain demons to gain access to certain Magatsuhi Skills, you often struggle to create a suitable team composition for certain encounters. It's a shame because some of the new skills are fun, but it's hard not to feel like you're hamstringing yourself by using them.\n\nOne of the biggest departures that Shin Megami Tensei V made from previous games was pivoting to explorable open-worlds instead of having an overworld map. It's a change that's still appreciated in Vengeance thanks to immensely rewarding exploration and fantastic level design made even better through the addition of Magatsuhi Rails that connect parts of levels together for seamless traversal.\n\nMuch like the original game, Vengeance is split up into four regions, each pertaining to a different part of Tokyo. A key difference in the Canon of Vengeance, though, is that the Chiyoda region is swapped out for an all new Shinjuku region. Because Shinjuku is part of the angels' dominion, it's vastly different from any other area in the game. A pale purple sand covers the ground and abstract structures are dotted throughout, culminating in an entirely new dungeon in place of The Demon King's Castle from the canon of creation.\n\nThe rest of the regions are largely unchanged, but how you approach objectives and the way they're structured is different. There's also a load of new sidequests to engage with throughout, most of which are markedly better than what's present in the base game, providing more nuanced objectives as opposed to simple fetch or kill quests. It feels like no matter how you spend your time in these regions, it always feels like you're progressing in some fashion.\n\nOne simple yet effective addition are Demon Haunts. These small areas accessible from Leyline Founts are areas where you can converse with your demons and accompanying characters to gauge how they feel about current events. They can also gain stats, level up, and give you gifts to use in your journeys. The Nahobino can also converse with Aogami at certain times to gain three skill points as well as his opinions on recent happenings. Its a small inclusion but one that gives more character to demons and your party in general.\n\nAll of these things in combination, and you can probably tell that Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is one hell of a package. You have two story routes, a truck-load of sidequests, a bunch of areas to explore, many demons to recruit, and more. There is so much content jammed in here that it automatically becomes an easy recommend for any JRPG fans - especially if you haven't played it before.\n\nOne aspect Vengeance undeniably nails, is its presentation. When it originally launched on the Switch, Shin Megami Tensei V was dripping with aesthetic and striking visual design that was held back by aging hardware. Playing it now on the PS5 is something like a fever dream. A buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second all the time, in combination with a much bolstered pixel count and overall visual fidelity leaves Shin Megami Tensei V feeling and looking as it always should have.\n\nThe final thing I'll shoutout, which should be to no one's surprise, is the absolutely phenomenal soundtrack. ATLUS never misses when it comes to music, but so many of Vengeance's new and reprised tracks are certified bangers in a genre full of musical competition. It's remarkable that Ryota Kozuka was able to push Shin Megami Tensei V's musical identity even further with such high quality.\n\nWhen all is said and done, it's inarguable that Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is the definitive version of Shin Megami Tensei V. Even if you dislike the narrative changes and additions in the Canon of Vengeance, the original story is still there for you to play. Some returning flaws aside, Vengeance still offers the same compelling gameplay loop, an intriguing world, and utterly fantastic presentation that heightens so much of the experience.", "source": {"uri": "press-start.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Press Start"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_kalogirou@press-start.com.au", "name": "Harry Kalogirou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canon Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exorcism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Character arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reincarnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puzzle video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shinjuku"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shinjuku"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://press-start.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/smt-v-review-banner.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Earlier in the week, Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection will bring Rocket Knight Adventures, SPARKSTER Rocket Knight Adventures 2, and SPARKSTER to modern-day consoles.\n\nFinally, PSVR 2 players get one new game this week in the form of the adventure game Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye.", "source": {"uri": "playstationlifestyle.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "PlayStation LifeStyle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_smith@playstationlifestyle.net", "name": "Rebecca Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_Rising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "V Rising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Knight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monster Hunter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action role-playing game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vampire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Stories", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monster Hunter Stories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Castlevania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Stories_2:_Wings_of_Ruin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Knight_Adventures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Knight Adventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adventure game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/V-Rising.png?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 406, "textEnd": 413}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-06-", "textStart": 50, "textEnd": 57}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Just accept it. Save often, grind where you can, and stick your nose into everyone's business to get all that lovely experience. Batten down the hatches, gird your loins, watch out. Boss battles might absolutely batter you the first time around, but then you get to go back in with your wits about you. Even some random encounters have the chance to one-shot you if you're not careful. This game doesn't take any prisoners.\n\nIn the vanilla release of Shin Megami Tensei 5, life was hard. In the redux, it's brutal. Good.\n\nShin Megami Tensei 5 Vengeance is class-A RPG - none of that gateway Persona nonsense that holds your hand and sings to you as you plod through your fancy little high school life. The parent MegaTen series has always been hard, it's almost a meme at this point, and whilst Vengeance isn't quite as tricky as SMT3 or 4, it's definitely still out for your blood. I say it's not as cruel as its forebears mostly because of the quality-of-life changes that have been added - being able to save anywhere, tweaks to UI readability, and clearer explanations of RPG systems see to that.\n\nBut the core gameplay loop is gritty. It's compelling. It's tough to crack, but when you do, it makes you ravenous - the kind of game you stay up into the little hours playing, because you want to beat one more optional boss or take down one more arrogant god. The series' trademark Press Turn system forces you to think about battles in terms of brutal efficiency, making you itch to double up your turns and genuinely groan out loud when you whiff an attack and waste your allies' upcoming moves.\n\nThe initial release of the game was good (the Press Turn mechanic ain't broke, so don't fix it), but in Vengeance there are a few more tweaks and additions to things. Special skills that take whole icons away from enemies or give you more next turn, upping potential sequential moves from eight to 10. Sounds small, right? But in action, this can be a game-changer. But, to keep in step with that, there are boss fights now that weren't in the 2021 release - multi-enemy and multi-phase fights when the game changes drastically around 50% of the way in.\n\nThe story is as camp and silly and devilish as it ever was, and as someone that finished the base game twice, I certainly took more out of this than I was expecting. The opening hours are a kind-of feint, almost - the really divergent stuff kicks off about 40 hours in, and just escalates from there. Old regional bosses, enemies and sub-plots remain in the new narrative path, they're just displaced, and sniffing out all the collectibles can get a little rote...but hey, it makes grinding a bit more fun at least.\n\nMega-powered regular mob spawns, interesting little side quests, massive over-leveled world enemies, and a through-line optional narrative branch that ties into the SMT multiverse all pad out the grim main story. Even in the bits you're re-treading, Atlus has injected new bosses and schisms into the narrative. So, even if you've done vanilla SMT5 on the Switch a few times, there's enough to come back for here (and there's nearly 100 new music tracks, to boot).\n\nIf you want my thoughts on the base game, you can check out my old pre-VG247 review . My opinion hasn't really changed since I wrote that all those years ago, but now there's more content to enjoy, too. Thing is, if you're going into this expecting a top-of-the-line, shiny RPG that looks like Final Fantasy 16, you're going to be upset. SMT5 Vengeance comes out on Switch, alongside all the other home consoles and PC. So it's limited in how nice it can look, sound, and feel.\n\nBut that's not the point of this game. It's not trying to be Final Fantasy. In fact, part of what I love so much about this game, and series, is that it marches to the beat of its own drum - eschewing the RPG trends of the moment (no romances for you) and doubling down on what makes it great. A tight, infinitely satisfying combat system, fun and unpredictable demon negotiation, and a metal-as-hell world. Everything it sets out to do, it does well. Even if it does feel like you're playing a glorified, modernised PS2 game. It's intentional, and it rules.\n\nIf you've the acquired taste for RPGs that want to bully you, humiliate you, and laugh at the fact you call yourself a gaming masochist (we're not judging), SMT5 Vengeance is for you. I think Atlus is the most exciting RPG developer out there at the moment, and between this, Metaphor Refantazio and whatever the hell Persona 6 is going to be, I dare you to prove me wrong.\n\nShin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance comes to PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, Xbox Series X and Series S on June 14, 2024.

Yes, it plays perfectly well on Nintendo Switch, but those large landscapes and detailed demons were always crying out for a more powerful machine. This hasn't been \"remastered\" in any way, still looking very similar to the original Switch release, but this port runs more smoothly, and at a higher resolution. What more can you really ask for?\n\nWell, one thing that fans were asking for was more story. The new \"Canon of Vengeance\" story path complements the original's Creation path. One of the primary complaints following SMTV's original release was that it simply didn't have enough cutscenes or story content to push the game along, and while there's a whole new story path present here, I want to re-emphasise the fact that it complements the original story. With the two put together, there's enough story content to please fans, but they're split into separate playthroughs.\n\nThose playthroughs won't be easy, either. SMT games are notoriously difficult, and Atlus hasn't turned down the difficulty to please newer fans of the series that have entered from Persona. If you know a demon's weakness in Persona, taking out your foes in a single turn is realistic. In SMTV, you'll be lucky to get that same result - and even then, a single critical hit against your protagonist could net you a game over before you even know what hit you.\n\nYes, only your protagonist needs to be knocked out in battle for a game over, and those game overs kick you all the way back to your last save from before the battle, no checkpoints. As a result, you'll be saving before you go pretty much anywhere to do anything. Save points are multi-functional: you can warp between them, use them to access a shop, fuse and manage demons, restore health, upgrade your perks - sorry, Miracles - and more. It's good that they're useful, because you'll be running back to them regularly, and thankfully they're placed pretty frequently across the world.\n\nThe desert-like landscapes of post-apocalyptic Tokyo are barely recognizable save for a few landmarks, and they're infested with demons in every corner. You can try to follow the waypointed progression path, but the tough difficulty will stop you in your tracks. Leveling up your protagonist and team of demons matters, and going through an area to clear through side quests and demon statues to harvest power from will usually give you enough strength to push on. With that said, there will still be some ridiculously strong demons that will ambush you near some treasure or on a thin path, and they can end your game quickly.\n\nIt meant that I had to take my time at every step, clearing out areas fully, and never progressing without a fresh save file and a full health bar. But this overly-cautious approach also makes SMTV feel like a slog to get through. Each time you reach a new save point - which, as mentioned, aren't too far away from one another - instead of looking for the next, you really have to stop, pick up side quests, and start digging around for anything that'll help you level up before moving on. If you don't, you'll get overwhelmed.\n\nThis is still the same game that launched on Nintendo Switch in 2021, and while the new Vengeance path is very cool, it isn't enough to warrant a second playthrough unless you're a big fan of the original game and the larger series.\n\nIt's been a busy year for lengthy JRPGs, and Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance isn't the best of the bunch. It's a solid JRPG adventure with a lot to love, but you'll be sent back to your last save file pretty regularly, and depending on how long it's been since your last save, that can suck the energy out of the room instantly. As a result, SMTV feels like stalling a classic car. Someone will tell you you're an idiot for not understanding the gearbox's nuances, but a smooth ride will be preferable to juddering down the road.", "source": {"uri": "videogames.si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Video Games"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Persona (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shin Megami Tensei V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saved game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cutscene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(game_terminology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health (game terminology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Game_Plus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Game Plus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of Eastern role-playing video games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Experience point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adventure game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3840,h_2160,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/video_games/01j05vfdg0sk2eqvf319.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644432", "eventUri": "eng-9644432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

JUst sHUt uP ANd LiSTeN! IT'S poP qUiZ tIME!\"\n\nI only asked the giant mothman if he wanted to join my team, so I'm not sure I deserved to get an insult-laden lead up to a quick demon recognition test in response. Still, it's better than that time an angry magic horse told me to dig my own grave, or all the instances I've been laughed at, called an idiot, or had some sneaky spirit demand I hand over all my health, magic, or (sometimes and) money only to dash off after they've drained me dry.\n\nNegotiating with demons in Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance is as dangerous, unpredictable, and hilarious as it's ever been in the 32 years of the series' existence, and like much in this latest entry will feel very familiar to fans of Atlus' longrunning apocalyptic RPG. Tokyo is once again the place where sassy mythological beings and neon-lined sci-fi meet, where programming and prayers have equal power.\n\nAnd as is now expected of a series that tends to treat reality-warping catastrophes and fights with every god and demon around as just another Tuesday, Vengeance begins with an enticing mix of everyday life, ethereal mysticism, vague warnings of impending doom -- and then throws in a brand new choice, just to make sure I don't get too comfortable. A single new interactive scene has been seamlessly slotted into SMT5's original opening, a simple decision determining whether the story afterwards plays out in exactly the same way it did on the Nintendo Switch back in 2021 (now dubbed the Creation story) or whether it follows the new Vengeance route.\n\nThis new path swiftly unfurls into a fascinating string of significant changes containing everything from exclusive major characters, new enemies, and shocking plot twists to very different takes on old events. Even if you've already cleared the old SMT5 in every way possible, Vengeance still has an entire game's worth of surprises ready to go.\n\nAnd getting to see them isn't as difficult as the series' intimidating reputation might make it sound, either. Appropriately enough for a game whose central themes are freedom, choice, and knowledge, Vengeance is eager to give me the tools I need to forge my own path through the trials ahead. Noteworthy features are explained clearly in concise popups as they arise, thoughtfully covering the entire spectrum of potential issues from battle system intricacies to \"What the heck is a main quest?\", ensuring nobody gets left behind.\n\nThe objective-smothered maps make it clear where the next main objective is, as well as dozens of alternative ways to spend my evenings, and roughly what I can get out of them if I do make the trip. Do I want to challenge some really tough bosses? Finally hand in the items that side quest I picked up hours ago wanted me to gather? Work my way over to some treasure squirrelled away in a corner I missed the last time I was here? Whatever I feel like doing, Vengeance makes it easy to get it done, with the ability to quickly warp back to and then between any leyline fount (multipurpose recovery/shop/fusion points found just about everywhere) turning region-spanning journeys into quick detours.\n\nKnowing where I am and where I'm going doesn't help me avoid the fights along the way though, and there's a lot to learn right from the start. Even the most basic enemies come with multiple resistances and weaknesses as standard, and then there are all those status effects, weird items, and moon phases to worry about on top. Between those and unhelpfully impenetrable spell names like \"Masukukaja\" it'd be easy to give up on the whole thing in an element-induced rage.\n\nIt doesn't happen though, because Vengeance tries its best to make everything as clear as possible, even when I'm facing hordes of monsters lifted from every folk tale ever told. The UI breaks down everything, revealing enemy weaknesses, explaining the effects of skills and spells, showing who they've been applied to, and indicating if they've stacked with a buff or debuff. Getting all of my demonic ducks in a row is a relatively painless process.\n\nAnd it's vital I get the hang of all this quickly because unless I'm drastically overleveled there's a real chance some random group of nobodies could wipe out my entire party. I'm always one careless decision away from a trip back to the title screen, one lazy assumption that healing can wait standing between me and my entire team getting burned to ash.\n\nAs unforgiving as Vengeance is of any slip-up, it always feels fair because the game can't do anything to me that I can't do to it. The series' now signature Press Turn system offers huge rewards for making even the mildest effort to engage with it, with every critical hit and exploited enemy weakness giving my team more turns in a row, and that means even more opportunities to pile on the pain -- or recover from it.\n\nAnd with so many deadly skills to learn and demons to fuse together into new and increasingly outlandish abominations, I'm encouraged to get creative about combat too. If I can't overpower a boss, then why don't I try weakening it instead? Why not boost my party's evasion, forcing its attacks to miss and its upcoming damage-dealing turns to disappear in the process? Why not use an item that completely blocks its favourite elemental attack just before it has a chance to unleash anything? The strategic possibilities here are endless, and before long I'm leaving bosses begging for a turn of their own, after which they'll probably just hit someone on their own team.\n\nMost of the time, anyway. Some days I'm too tired, or too busy, or just too excited to see where the story goes to want to spend my free time carefully constructing the sort of teams and tactics able to topple gods and send demons scuttling back to the netherworld. So it's a good thing Vengeance is happy to help, once more. Thanks to its easy-going approach to difficulty settings it can keep the story going for everyone, from dedicated demon hunters to first-timers.\n\nThree options are available by default -- Casual, Normal, and Hard -- and the first two can be switched between at will at any time outside of battle, with the only penalty being to my pride (Hard players can also switch down to either, but can't go back up). So if there's one fight that just isn't working out the way I hoped it would, I know there's always a way to tip the scales in my favour that doesn't involve rushing off to copy someone else's SMT homework or hours of mindless grinding, and I also know that once I've found my feet/confidence/brain again I can go back to Normal and carry on as before.\n\nOr I can just keep trying instead. Vengeance's new save anywhere feature gives my more daring attempts to win a welcome safety net. Why not try out some weird demon build or risk some strange negotiation option that's never come up before when I only have to worry about losing a few minutes worth of progress at most? Maybe my attempt will end in a quick and embarrassing death, maybe it'll end with me laughing out loud as a talking animal-monster with a bad attitude insists I'd be better off throwing my brain away, but whatever happens at least I have the opportunity to experiment.\n\nVengeance is an easy game to like. It's an epic adventure packed full of surprises, with enough bite and strategic depth for the oldest of old hands, and more than enough assistance to help newcomers feel right at home. No series does the whole 'taking on god' thing as perfectly as Shin Megami Tensei, and seeing every deity and spirit imaginable wandering around Tokyo, right next to schools, trains, and vending machines will always be an incredible sight. On PC the game's sharp-edged style shines, the otherworldly monster designs really coming into their own at high resolutions. It always runs smoothly even when the screen's packed with detail too, and the game's relatively humble Switch beginnings make it a comfortable -- and good looking -- fit on a wide range of hardware.

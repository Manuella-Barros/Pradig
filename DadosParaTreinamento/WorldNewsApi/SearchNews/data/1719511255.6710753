The problem would be solved by Tuesday, officials said.The reservoir at Samalkot stores canal water, which KMC brings to Kakinada through a pipeline. But, the National Highways proposed an NH road from Achampet to Samalkot. The old pipeline falls under the road.The National Highways Authority released the `22 crore to KMC to lay the pipeline and civic body would link the new pipeline to the old pipeline.Meanwhile, the authorities found leakages in some of the pipelines in the city and this affected the supply of drinking water to the people.Meanwhile, people of several areas like Dummulapeta, Sanjay Nagar, Dairy Farm centre etc are facing the drinking water problem.The BJP alleged that the Kakinada Municipal Corporation (KMC) has failed in supplying drinking water to people as it had not taken prior steps to avoid the leakages and store water during the summer.BJP official spokesperson Yarlagadda Ramkumar said the central government released crores to KMC as a part of the AMRUT scheme \u2013 the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation. but the officials failed in its proper utilization.\u201cKakinada is facing a drinking water problem during the summer and an inundation problem during the rainy season. The government should order a detailed probe into this,\u201d he said.BJP leader Duvvuri Subrahmanyam said officials were working in KMC for years together without any transfers, under the influence of politicians. \u201cThey are serving the political representatives, but not for the people. When the pipes got repaired, the officials did not sort out the problems.\u201dThe Kakinada Poura Samkshema Sangham convener Dusarlapudi Ramana Raju said that during the rains, the pipeline water mingled with the drainage water and the KMC kept supplying the same water to the people.

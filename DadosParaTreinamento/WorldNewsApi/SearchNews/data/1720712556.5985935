Councilman Jeremy Rivas, D-2nd, a former council president, expressed concerns about the \u201cGarage Mahal\u201d project, as he termed it, during the council\u2019s May 28 meeting. \u201cWe have a lot of buildings out there,\u201d Rivas said, and spending $18 million for replacing the dilapidated highway garage leaves just $6 million for work at the jail, based on a $25 million bond. The other $1 million would be for financing and related costs. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about $200,000 payouts, but we\u2019re not talking about a $25 million bond,\u201d Rivas said near the end of the meeting. The county has a new facilities director who is assessing needs at all the buildings. Will the commissioners engage Skillman Corp. to look at needs at the Juvenile Detention Center, he asked. Rivas was president when Skillman oversaw a massive overhaul of the downtown Valparaiso courthouse, renovation of the old jail at 157 Franklin, construction of a new building at the North County Government Complex and related work. The bond for the work at the highway garage and jail is pegged at $25 million. The county won\u2019t have to raise taxes to pay for a new bond when the old bond from building the jail is paid off. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot more work to do for the jail,\u201d Rivas said. It needs a new roof and interior work, he said, adding, \u201c$6 million for the jail is not going to replace the roof.\u201d Councilman Ronald \u201cRed\u201d Stone, R-1st, asked whether Rivas shared his concerns at a meeting regarding the highway garage. \u201cWe shared our concerns that we were not getting any information at a public meeting,\u201d said Councilwoman Sylvia Graham, D-At-large. \u201cAre we not to talk about this stuff, $25 million, at a public meeting?\u201d Rivas asked. Council President Mike Brickner, R-At-large, offered to request Board of Commissioners President Jim Biggs attend the next council meeting, to be held later this month. Rivas also wants answers about the future of the county\u2019s ambulance service, following news that more than 30 ambulance workers expressed a lack of confidence in the ambulance director. Northwest Health Porter provides the service under contract with the county to areas where fire departments don\u2019t provide ambulance service. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with contracting out public safety at all,\u201d Rivas said. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on that all those employees signed a no-confidence. Why?\u201d Rivas said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t have an interest, but we don\u2019t have a say in that,\u201d Brickner said. \u201cWe do not hire that employee. I feel reluctant to stick our nose in something that he\u2019s not our employee.\u201d When he became president of the Board of Commissioners last year, Biggs, R-North, set up a public safety commission to examine public safety needs in the county. \u201cSome of us are fortunate to live in municipalities where we have professionals on standby,\u201d Rivas said. \u201cEmergency services and public safety is pretty high up on my list.\u201d Councilman Andy Vasquez, R-4th, whose district is in south Porter County, said the Morgan and Kouts fire departments have good ambulance services, What about creating fire territories so every area is covered by a full-time professional, Rivas asked. Fire territories are separate taxing districts. The Valparaiso Fire Department is part of a fire territory that includes the city and unincorporated Center Township. Vasquez said he and Councilman Andy Bozak, R-At-large, tried to have this conversation. \u201cI didn\u2019t go very far. Commissioner Biggs didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with it,\u201d Vasquez said. He suggested getting the fire chiefs of departments in unincorporated areas to attend a meeting. Hear them out and try to explain to them why a fire territory is in the best interest of people in unincorporated areas, he suggested. \u201cIt will be an uphill sale, I\u2019ll tell you right now,\u201d Vasquez said. Graham praised the Valparaiso fire territory but said she was skeptical when its creation was still under discussion. The late Gary Nondorf was the fire chief then. \u201cI\u2019m not in favor of taxes going up because I\u2019m not a senior citizen,\u201d Graham said, but the increase was minimal. Chesterton and Burns Harbor formerly paid for ambulance service but have now handed that over to the county, Rivas said. \u201cOur cost is going to skyrocket.\u201d \u201cWith that increased price tag when it comes, where is the money coming from?\u201d Rivas asked. Even if fire territories were created to generate money for ambulance service as well as fire protection, that\u2019s a big step and wouldn\u2019t happen overnight, Vasquez pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on us to make sure everyone in the county has good ambulance service,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our work cut out for us when it comes to some things coming down the pike,\u201d Brickner said. \u201cWe have a lot of other issues at hand as well that are our responsibility.\u201d Doug Ross is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune.", "summary": "The Porter County Council is asking a member of the Board of Commissioners to answer questions about the future of the county\u2019s ambulance service and the cost of work at the highway garage in Center Township.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/09/porter-county-commissioners-summoned-to-council-meeting-to-address-garage-mahal-ambulance-service/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2024/01/08/HLYT4GOIVNFQVM7QJNOFDPEVRI.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:24:51", "author": "Doug Ross", "authors": ["Doug Ross"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.133}

PM Modi New Delhi: In a fresh war of words, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the INDIA bloc wants to turn the country\u2019s majority community into second-class citizens and also alleged that \u201cjihadis\u201d across the border are supporting the Samajwadi Party and the Congress. PM Modi also attacked the parties of the opposition bloc, alleging they are planning to rewrite the Constitution to provide reservations on the basis of religion, as per a report by news agency ANI. The prime minister was in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Purvanchal region to address rallies in Ghosi, Deoria and Mirzapur in support of BJP and NDA Lok Sabha poll candidates contesting in the seventh and last phase of the general elections on June 1. \u201cIn Pakistan, \u2018duas\u2019 (prayers) are being made for the INDI alliance of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress. Jihadis across the border are supporting them. The SP and the Congress are making an appeal for \u2018vote jihad\u2019,\u201d Modi said in an apparent reference to a remark by an INDIA bloc candidate. \u201cThis (INDIA bloc) group is saying that if they come to power, they will reimpose Article 370 in Kashmir. They will repeal the CAA (Citizenship (Amendment) Act) which gives citizenship to the victims of Partition. Whose agenda is this\u2026 this is what these anti-India forces want.\u201d he said. Hitting out at the bloc, Prime Minister Modi claimed the \u201cINDI Jamaat\u201d has been abusing him for his opposition to reservation on the basis of religion. The prime minister listed three \u201cbig conspiracies\u201d of the opposition bloc and said, \u201cFirst, the people of INDI alliance will change the Constitution and write in it afresh that reservation should be given on the basis of religion in India. Second, these INDI people will end the reservation given to SC, ST, and OBC. Third, they will give the entire reservation to Muslims on the basis of religion,\u201d Modi said. He said, \u201cA third method has been created to circumvent the OBC reservation. They are declaring Muslim castes as OBC overnight. Recently, the Calcutta High Court rejected OBC reservations for 77 Muslim castes.\u201d Modi went on to add, \u201cToday, the SP, Congress and the INDI people want to make the majority community in India second-class citizens.\u201d He also branded the bloc as communal and casteist, and targeted the SP, saying people associated with it have a \u201c\u2018chhatees ka ankara\u2019 (animosity) with law and order\u201d. \u201cThe SP used to release captured terrorists and its government used to suspend police officials for catching terrorist,\u201d PM Modi said adding that the party kept Purvanchal backward under a conspiracy. \u201cDuring the SP government, mafias built palaces on public land. But since Yogi Adityanath has come (as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh) the environment has changed. Now, the \u2018acche din\u2019 (good days) of mafias are over. Houses of the poor are being built in place of their palaces. This is the difference between the BJP and the INDI alliance,\u201d he said. Modi alleged that the \u201cfamilies of the SP and the Congress had their dynastic mindset to turn Purvanchal into a region of mafia, poverty and helplessness.\u201d. \u201cI want to remind you that in 2012, the SP stated in its manifesto had stated that Muslim should get reservation equal to that of Dalits. The INDI jamaat wants to change the Constitution for this. When I ask them (about reservation) they abuse Modi,\u201d he said, adding that he is opposing reservation on the basis of religion. The people of the Purvanchal region will punish them for these, he said. Modi also alleged that the Congress created \u201croadblocks\u201d for countries that wanted to purchase the BrahMos missiles. \u201cThere has been a demand for these in many countries but the Congress does not like it. Many countries wanted to purchase the BrahMos but the Congress government created hurdles because the \u2018INDI\u2019 people do not want India to become self-reliant in the defence sector,\u201d Modi said. The prime minister said, \u201cThe day is not far when BrahMos missiles will also be made in Uttar Pradesh.\u201d Referring to previous poll manifestos of the SP and the Congress, Modi said, \u201cIn 2012 (assembly polls), the SP had clearly written in its manifesto that the reservation that Babasaheb gave to Dalits, similar reservations will be given to Muslims.\u201d The Congress declared educational establishments as minority institutions and gave reservations to Muslims there, he claimed. \u201cBefore 2014, the Congress changed the law overnight to declare schools, colleges and universities as minority institutions. They declared thousands of educational institutions as minority institutions. Earlier, the reservation SC, ST and OBC students were getting there was completely ended and Muslims got reservation,\u201d Modi said. \u201cWhat can be a bigger betrayal than this of the sons and daughters of Dalits, backward tribals?\u201d Modi asked and added that the INDIA bloc wants to \u201ctake back the country by several decades.\u201d. PM Modi Referes To PM ModiReferring to the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the prime minister said people from across the world are visiting it for a \u2018darshan\u2019 of Ram Lalla. But those of the SP and the Congress rejected the invitation for the temple\u2019s consecration ceremony, Modi said. \u201cThey pretend to go to temples during elections. But these people started abusing the Ram temple when such a grand festival (consecration ceremony) of our faith came after 500 years. These people were angry with the construction of the Ram temple,\u201d he said. He also claimed that these opposition parties talk about reversing the verdict in the Ram temple case just as it was done in the Shah Bano case. In 1985, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Shah Bano, a Muslim woman from Indore who had sought maintenance from her husband after divorce, but the then-Rajiv Gandhi government overturned the judgement through an Act. In November 2019, a five-judge apex court bench paved the way for construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, ending a decades-long land dispute. The prime minister said when \u201cModi openly exposes them (the opposition), they raise slogans of digging Modi\u2019s grave.\u201d \u201cThey issue fatwas of vote jihad against Modi but as long as Modi has the protective shield of the mothers and sisters of the country and the blessings of all of you, no one can do any harm to Modi,\u201d he said. In Mau district\u2019s Ghosi, Modi campaigned for NDA partner SBSP\u2019s Arvind Rajbhar (Ghosi) and BJP\u2019s Neeraj Shekhar (Ballia) and Ravindra Kushwaha (Salempur). He sought support for the BJP\u2019s Kamlesh Paswan (Bansgaon) and Shashank Mani Tripathi (Deoria) in Deoria in Gorakhpur district and for NDA partner Apna Dal\u2019s Anupriya Patel (Mirzapur) and Rinki Kol (Robertsganj) in Mirzapur district.

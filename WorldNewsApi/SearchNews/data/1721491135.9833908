Yet, to the villagers, it\u2019s strange being asked to fill out paperwork for permission to do what they already know how to do _ set a prescribed burn in good weather so they can clear a patch of land for the coming year\u2019s crops. Tiengtrongsakun, the Pakanyo chief in the village of Ban Mae Lan Kham, this year did paperwork for 100 households who needed to start a fire to clear their fields. Not everyone in the village speaks Thai or understands the latest government policy. \u201cIf we hand them the document or registration form, they don\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d he said. \u201cOften they just throw the papers away.\u201d Researchers say policymakers need to look at the conditions of people\u2019s lives and consider the details of which land is being burned and why. But it\u2019s difficult because of politics and economics. Many of the people living in the hills surrounding Chiang Mai belong to various tribal groups not formally recognized by the Thai government. Others struggle with access to good education and jobs.

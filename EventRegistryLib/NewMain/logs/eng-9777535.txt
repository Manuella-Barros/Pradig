light' to members to...", "body": "Members of the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua have been given the \"green light\" to open fire on and attack cops in Denver, a federal memo obtained by The Post reveals.\n\nThe gang is already tied to hundreds of crimes, including the shootings of two NYPD cops who were trying to arrest one of the members in June.\n\n\"Credible human sources from Colorado provided information on TdA [Tren de Aragua] giving a 'green light' to fire on or attack law enforcement,\" the memo, from the Homeland Security Investigations office in Chicago, said.\n\n\"As you may know, we have a TdA presence here in Chicago, so please be vigilant as you encounter TdA members or affiliates during your investigative and operational activities.\"\n\nThe gang already has a presence in Chicago, the memo noted, adding: \"Credible human sources from Colorado provided\" the intelligence via the Albuquerque Police Department.\n\nThe warning comes as Denver has gotten 42,000 migrants -- the most migrants per capita than any other US city -- and many of them are from Venezuela.\n\nThe prison gang whose name means \"The Aragua Train\" -- a reference to the Aragua region in Venezuela -- has infiltrated the US by sending members posing as asylum seekers across the southern border.\n\nFrom there, its members have flocked to major US cities including New York, Chicago, Miami and Denver, where they engage in money laundering, gun smuggling, theft and human trafficking, according to reports.\n\nThe Border Patrol only began tracking the group last year and has recorded catching 70 of its members, according to federal data.\n\nHowever, many are getting past law enforcement at the border and their vetting processes because its younger members are careful not to get gang tattoos or other identifiers to stay under the radar, sources have told The Post.\n\nRight now \"it's far too easy for criminals to enter the US,\" a Border Patrol source told The Post.\n\n\"We have zero access to other nations' criminal databases and with this administration's uselessness in deterring these criminals, they will keep entering undetected,\" said the source.\n\nThe gang has been the subject of more than 100 criminal investigations opened by federal authorities, according to NBC News.\n\nEarlier this month, the Biden administration designated the gang as a transnational criminal organization and began offering a $12 million reward for the arrests of its leaders.\n\nVenezuelan migrant Bernardo Raul Castro Mata, 19, who is accused of shooting two NYPD officers on June 3, allegedly told cops he was recruited by the Venezuelan gang's Big Apple \"coordinator\" to join its \"snatch and grab\" moped thieves.\n\nAfter illegally crossing the border into Texas last July, Castro Mata allegedly said he was encouraged to get gang tattoos to prove his allegiance, sources previously told The Post.\n\nCastro Mata also revealed that the gang has been smuggling guns into New York City's migrant shelters in food delivery bags.\n\nIt's also believed that the gang is tied to the assault on two cops in Times Square that occurred n back in January.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tren_de_Aragua", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

DPD is monitoring and making officers aware of the safety concerns shared by our law enforcement partners,\" the statement said.\n\nAPD said it couldn't confirm any information in media reports, and said that disclosure of internal police bulletins \"could put investigations and/or officers at risk.\"\n\nHSI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\nThe notification is the latest warning in regards to the Venezuelan street gang, some members of which have come across the southern border.\n\n\"Keep your eye on this gang,\" Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens warned in May. \"Their criminal activities represent a serious threat to our communities!\"\n\nTdA is said to specialize in extortion, kidnapping, murder and sex trafficking. Federal authorities have been warning that the gang is trying to establish itself in the U.S., where police are already linking it to organized crime. The FBI has also warned that the gang could team up with the bloodthirsty MS-13.\n\nThe gang drew additional attention when it emerged that the brother of the suspect in the killing of Georgia student Laken Riley had ties to the gang. Both are Venezuelan illegal immigrants. Recently the Treasury designated Tren de Aragua a significant transnational criminal organization and offered financial rewards for the conviction of three of its leaders.\n\nJohn Fabbricatore, a former ICE field office director who is now running for a congressional seat in Colorado as a Republican, told Fox News Digital that the gang has got a foothold in the state and is taking over apartment buildings. He said that the gang has taken advantage of the ongoing border crisis.\n\n\"This whole border situation over the last three and a half years has allowed countless criminals to be allowed into the United States, and we're seeing an uptick in crime, especially in illegal immigrant crime throughout the US, and sanctuary cities are just magnetizing it,\" he said.\n\nHe also joined others in warning about the gang, saying they are involved in drug trafficking, large-scale operations and other crimes.\n\n\"For United States citizens, for people here within the United States, they are a dangerous gang. And with them just putting out a green light on police officers here in the United States, we could potentially see police officers being shot at by these gang members because they do not fear the law enforcement in the United States,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News",

DPD is monitoring and making officers aware of the safety concerns shared by our law enforcement partners,\" the statement said.\n\nAPD said it couldn't confirm any information in media reports, and said that disclosure of internal police bulletins \"could put investigations and/or officers at risk.\"\n\nHSI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\nThe notification is the latest warning in regards to the Venezuelan street gang, some members of which have come across the southern border.\n\n\"Keep your eye on this gang,\" Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens warned in May. \"Their criminal activities represent a serious threat to our communities!\"\n\nCustoms and Border Protections (CBP) has previously distributed intelligence bulletins to agents revealing the tattoos and identifiers for the gang.\n\nBLOODTHIRSTY VENEZUELAN GANG TREN DE ARAGUA SETS UP SHOP IN US AS BORDER AUTHORITIES SOUND ALARM\n\nTdA is said to specialize in extortion, kidnapping, murder and sex trafficking. Federal authorities have been warning that the gang is trying to establish itself in the U.S., where police are already linking it to organized crime. The FBI has also warned that the gang could team up with the bloodthirsty MS-13.\n\nThe gang drew additional attention when it emerged that the brother of the suspect in the killing of Georgia student Laken Riley had ties to the gang. Both are Venezuelan illegal immigrants. Recently the Treasury designated Tren de Aragua a significant transnational criminal organization and offered financial rewards for the conviction of three of its leaders.\n\nJohn Fabbricatore, a former ICE field office director who is now running for a congressional seat in Colorado as a Republican, told Fox News Digital that the gang has got a foothold in the state and is taking over apartment buildings. He said that the gang has taken advantage of the ongoing border crisis.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS\n\n\"This whole border situation over the last three and a half years has allowed countless criminals to be allowed into the United States, and we're seeing an uptick in crime, especially in illegal immigrant crime throughout the US, and sanctuary cities are just magnetizing it,\" he said.\n\nHe also joined others in warning about the gang, saying they are involved in drug trafficking, large-scale operations and other crimes.\n\n\"For United States citizens, for people here within the United States, they are a dangerous gang. And with them just putting out a green light on police officers here in the United States, we could potentially see police officers being shot at by these gang members because they do not fear the law

Denver, a self-proclaimed sanctuary city for illegal immigrants, has received 42,000 migrants in the past year -- more per capita than any other U.S. city, according to the Post -- and many are asylum seekers from Venezuela.\n\nThe gang is tied to hundreds of crimes, allegedly including the shootings of two New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers who were trying to arrest one of its members in June, the Post reported. Venezuelan Bernardo Raul Castro Mata, 19, who is accused of shooting the NYPD officers on June 3, allegedly told police he was recruited by the Venezuelan gang's Big Apple coordinator to join its \"snatch and grab\" operation of moped thieves.\n\nCastro Mata, who reportedly crossed the southern border into Texas illegally in July 2023, allegedly said he was encouraged to get gang tattoos to prove his allegiance. Castro Mata also told police the gang has been smuggling guns into New York's migrant shelters in food delivery bags.\n\nThe Border Patrol began tracking the group only last year and has caught 70 of its members, the Post reported, citing federal data. But many are getting past law enforcement and vetting processes at the border because younger members are careful not to get gang tattoos or other identifiers.\n\nRight now, \"it's far too easy for criminals to enter the U.S.,\" a Border Patrol source told the Post. \"We have zero access to other nations' criminal databases and with this administration's uselessness in deterring these criminals, they will keep entering undetected.\"\n\nOn July 11, the Biden administration designated the gang as a transnational criminal organization and offered up to a total of $12 million in rewards for information leading to the arrests and/or convictions of three of its leaders: H\u00e9ctor Rusthenford Guerrero, whose alias is \"Ni\u00f1o Guerrero\" (up to $5 million reward); Yohan Jose Romero, whose alias is \"Johan Petrica\" (up to $4 million reward); and Giovanny San Vicente, whose aliases are \"Giovanny,\" \"Viejo Viejo,\" and \"El Viejo\" (up to $3 million reward).\n\nMichael Katz

Venezuelan Gang Approves Killing US Cops", "body": "We've been receiving warnings for some time now that violent gang members from Venezuela have been leaving their homeland and crossing Joe Biden's open southern border to set up shop in the United States. We've been told this by the Border Patrol, the FBI, and both state and local police. They meet up with friends already operating in our cities and they aren't coming here to \"seek a new life.\" They are continuing the family business with some of the profits flowing back to their old bosses in Venezuela. Business is booming and it's exceedingly violent. But now it's probably becoming an even more dangerous situation. The leadership of the Tren de Aragua gang in Venezuela has reportedly sent word up North that their members in the Denver area have a \"green light\" to shoot and kill the Denver police if they try to interfere with their \"operations.\" As if Denver needed one more thing to worry about amidst a flood of illegal migrants overflowing the shelters and sucking up all of the community resources. (NY Post)\n\nMembers of the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua have been given the \"green light\" to attack and open fire on cops in Denver, a federal memo obtained by The Post reveals.\n\nThe gang is already tied to hundreds of crimes, including the shootings of two NYPD cops who were trying to arrest one of its members in June.\n\n\"Credible human sources from Colorado provided information on TdA [Tren de Aragua] giving a 'green light' to fire on or attack law enforcement,\" said the memo, from the Homeland Security Investigations office in Chicago.\n\nI've researched some of the reports on this group and I'm not 100% sure that TdA is as bad as MS-13, but they are definitely playing in the same league. The website InSight Crime has a good profile on the group. They started out as a relatively small prison gang in the state of Aragua in Venezuela, but they had big ambitions. They quickly grew into a transnational threat and smuggling operation worth billions. And they have no compunction about killing law enforcement. When America's southern border was opened in 2021, they began swarming in like locusts. The State Department is currently offering a $12 million reward for information leading to the capture of the gang's three highest-ranking leaders no matter what country they are spotted in.\n\nHow often have we heard leftist propagandists in politics and the media repeating the same tropes about this subject? When Donald Trump gives a campaign speech, he regularly talks about the dangers of our open borders and reminds us that countries like Venezuela are emptying their prisons and mental hospitals and sending the worst of the worst to our country. For this, he is regularly decried as a racist and those claims of racism continue no matter how many horror stories of trafficking, rape, and murder unfold before our eyes. The story of Tren de Aragua in the Denver area is not some new phenomenon. It's only the latest chapter in an ongoing story that has been gaining steam for several years.\n\nMuch of the crime that's seen unfolding surrounding illegal migrant and homeless encampments seems to be primarily lower-cost, street-level crime. Much of it primarily involves property crime and drug sales, replete with overdoses. That's all certainly bad enough, but that's not what we're talking about here. There is no question that TdA is involved in drug trafficking and certainly human trafficking as well, including minors. But they are into so much more. They've gone far beyond street-level, smash-and-grab looting. This is basically the Venezuelan mafia that we're talking about at this point and they are international in nature. (Not that I'm suggesting there's any such thing as the Mafia in real life, just in case any of our fine Italian-American friends are reading this... we cool, guys?)\n\nThe point is that the southern border is not \"fine,\" no matter what you hear on MSNBC and CNN. In reality, the northern border isn't all the much better but we'll need to deal with that later. The Biden/Harris policies have not only not fixed anything, they caused all of this to begin with and it's not getting any better. TdA is just the latest iteration and they don't traditionally make empty threats. If their bosses back in Venezuela have given a thumbs up to killing police in Denver (and who knows where else), you can rest assured that some of the gang members will try to take them up on the offer. And if a TdA gangbanger kills a Denver cop, never forget that the officer's blood will be on the hands of Joe Biden and his border czar, Kamala Harris.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType":

actions being taken to identify and disrupt Tren de Aragua and other violent criminal organizations through a combination of investigative, prosecutorial, diplomatic, screening, and vetting tools,\" National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement.\n\nWatson added that law enforcement agents were working to investigate and prosecute the gang's members at the southern border and abroad.\n\n\"The Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and DOJ are supporting foreign partners in their efforts to disrupt Tren de Aragua, and DHS has implemented

a threat posed by Tren De Aragua (TdA), the largest criminal organization in embattled Venezuela, after an apparent \"green light\" to attack American law enforcement has been given to its members who have infiltrated the United States.\n\n\"Homeland Security Investigations reported that Tren De Aragua (TdA) criminal organization members in Denver have been given a 'green light' to fire on or attack law enforcement in Denver, Colorado,\" the message from HSI's Chicago office warns before adding \"HSI New York reportedly received the same information\" which is \"deemed to be credible.\"\n\n\"As you may know, we have a TdA presence here in Chicago, so please be vigilant as you encounter TdA members or affiliates during your investigative and operational activities,\" the warning emphasized.\n\nIt's an alarming development for a foreign criminal organization known for its human, weapon, and drug trafficking, among other illicit activities, to be giving an order to attack and/or shoot U.S. law enforcement on American soil, one made possible -- and worse -- by the crisis that has raged under the watch of Biden administration Border Czar Kamala Harris.\n\nAccording to the bulletin warning law enforcement of the \"green light\" for TdA attacks, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) \"has encountered approximately 26 known / identified TdA members in FY24, and 43 in FY23 at the point of encounter.\"\n\nAt present, however, intelligence and data \"suggests there are over 1,000 TdA members in the United States.\"\n\nReporting from the New York Post on the bulletin noted that TdA is \"already tied to hundreds of crimes, including the shootings of two NYPD cops who were trying to arrest one of its members in June.\"", "source": {"uri":

Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said. \"Right now, local law enforcement relies on the federal component to provide additional information. What if it's vice versa; what if the person on the ground that knows their community was providing information upstream?\n\n\"Why not arm local law enforcement with more information and not just blindly walking through because in many cases, they're the ones having to deal with these actors on a daily basis?\"\n\nGonzales' comments come in response to a NewsNation report alleging 1,000 members of Tren de Aragua are in the United States and have received a \"green light\" from their leaders to fire on police officers. The report is based on a Border Patrol internal bulletin.\n\nGonzales, whose congressional district runs from El Paso to the other side of Eagle Pass, Texas, did not say if he's seen the bulletin but agrees bad actors are getting through the U.S.-Mexico border. He said the threat is \"credible\" and should be taken seriously.\n\n\"This (Tren de Aragua) threat is growing. These Venezuelan gangs are not just passing through, they're staying in our communities,\" Gonzales said Tuesday during a Zoom call with Border Report and KTSM. \"In San Antonio, just two days ago, a police officer was shot by a Venezuelan national - I don't know if he's TDA, but he shot a police officer. What worries me is these organizations are brazen; they're not afraid to engage. If they're going to shoot a police officer, what are they going to do to you and I?\"\n\nThe federal lawmaker said he met with the director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently and was told that more than 10,000 unauthorized migrants have committed serious crimes either after arriving in the United States or back in their country of origin.\n\nHe added he's been to processing centers where he's seen men with face and hand tattoos. \"Was he Venezuelan? We have no idea. That's what worries me,\" Gonzales said. \"We have to know who is coming into our country. Just giving them (immigration) parole and hoping for the best is not the best course of action. We have to protect our communities.\"\n\nThe local-federal gang task forces he's proposing would target those suspected of committing crimes in the U.S. or abroad. He's proposing allocating federal funds for this endeavor and says Bexar County law enforcement in San Antonio is getting a $2.7 million intelligence center.\n\nGonzales emphasized the threat from Tren de Aragua, which began as a Venezuelan prison gang and has become a transnational criminal organization whose fugitive leaders are under a $12 million bounty in the United States.\n\n\"Venezuela has been a failed state for a very long time. There is a reason why people are fleeing,\" he said, referring to hundreds of thousands of citizens of that country that have come to the U.S. requesting asylum. \"What is happening in Venezuela certainly impacts the United States because so many people have come over from Venezuela. What I worry about is now (their) government has essentially broken down. We have no relationship with them when someone comes over illegally.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktsm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTSM 9 News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julian_resendiz@ktsm.com", "name": "Julian Resendiz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tren_de_Aragua", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tren de Aragua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gonzales, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gonzales, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gonzales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Gonzales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Pass,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagle Pass, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eagle Pass, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_(reward)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bounty (reward)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Failed state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bexar_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bexar County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bexar County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.ktsm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2024/07/Venezuelan-wanted-for-homicide-in-Colombia.png?strip=1&w=144", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777535", "eventUri": "eng-9777535", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

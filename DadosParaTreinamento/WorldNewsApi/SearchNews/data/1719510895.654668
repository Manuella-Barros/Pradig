According to the Telegraph, he said: \"We don\u2019t trust you, Jay\u2014you lied to our face.\" It was also purported that his comment led to Rory McIlroy effectively expressing loyalty towards Monahan, allegedly replying: \"Just play better, Grayson,\" while Murray reportedly fired back with an expletive in response. This version of events was corroborated by Michael Kim, who was present for the meeting, who added on Twitter/X: \"There was some more dialogue between the 'lied to our face' and 'just play better' quotes.\" Murray also called out the PGA Tour in a deleted post on Twitter/X in 2021, where he wrote: \"No the PGA Tour didn\u2019t force me to drink. but the PGA Tour never gave me help. In my five years of experience of being on tour not once have I ever had a request been acknowledged by the commissioner or the PAC other than \u2018we will get back to you\u2019. \"I hope not only the PGA tour steps up in the areas they need to step up but I also hope people are held accountable in their roles they serve.\" Commissioner Monahan later confirmed that he contacted the golfer after news reached him of the post, saying: \"When Grayson said that, I called him right away. You know, over the last several years, I spent a lot of time with him because I wanted to understand what we could do in his estimation, in his opinion, to help everybody else out here. \"We\u2019ve made a number of advancements along those lines and, you know, it\u2019s become a real point of focus and emphasis. We\u2019re proud of the programs we have in place to support our players, to support everybody out here.\" Paying tribute to Murray following his passing, Monahan said: \"We were devastated to learn \u2013 and are heartbroken to share \u2013 that PGA Tour player Grayson Murray passed away this morning. I am at a loss for words. The PGA Tour is a family, and when you lose a member of your family, you are never the same. We mourn Grayson and pray for comfort for his loved ones. \"I reached out to Grayson\u2019s parents to offer our deepest condolences, and during that conversation, they asked that we continue with tournament play. They were adamant that Grayson would want us to do so. As difficult as it will be, we want to respect their wishes.\"", "summary": "Tributes to Grayson Murray have been paid from across the sporting landscape following the golfer's tragic passing at the age of just 30, with the two-time PGA Tour event winner held in high esteem", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/grayson-murray-jay-monahan-liv-32895999", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896149.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2153282345.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:30:14", "author": "Tom Beattie,Tom-beattie", "authors": ["Tom Beattie", "Tom-beattie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.204}

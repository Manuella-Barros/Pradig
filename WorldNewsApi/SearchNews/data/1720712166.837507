James Had to Be in the Musical (Exclusive)", "text": "Shaina Taub is proud of her Tony-nominated Suffs costar Nikki M. James. The actress-musician, 35, knew in the early stages of writing the women's suffrage\u2013focused Broadway musical that James, 43, would be a perfect fit for the role of Ida B. Wells. \u201cFrom my earliest research, I knew that Ida B. Wells had to be an important part of this musical,\u201d Taub tells PEOPLE. \u201cShe is such a strong example of the power of standing in your truth and not making a compromise when you know that you're doing the right thing.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long for Taub to recognize who would be the right person to take on the role. \u201cFrom the earliest moments when I knew that Ida B. Wells had to be in the musical, I knew that Nikki M. James had to be in the musical,\u201d Taub explains. She says, \u201cAs I was starting to write in 2016, we were putting on a musical adaptation I did of Twelfth Night at Shakespearean Park in New York, and Nikki was starring as Viola. I'd been a fan of her from afar for years but then we finally met, and to have her sing my music at that early stage when I was really just starting to find my voice as a writer, she really became a muse for me.\u201d Referring to James as \u201cthe most astonishing actor [she\u2019s ever] worked with\u201d \u2014 \u201cI mean, her facility as an actor, specifically through song, it's just such a unique gift, how much she can do with just a note,\u201d she says \u2014 Taub asked her to come on board for Suffs\u2019 earliest reading. \u201cI knew right away that there was a kinship with her and Ida and the fierceness and the vulnerability and the range that she has,\u201d Taub, who plays Alice Paul in the musical, says of casting James.

Among Suffs\u2019s six Tony nominations, including best musical, James is nominated for best featured actress in a musical, an accolade Taub says is well-deserved. \u201cI'm so thrilled she's being recognized in this major way because she so majorly deserves it,\u201d Taub says. \u201cJust to feel the impact she has on an audience every night, because I'm there, I'm onstage with her, is just staggering.\u201d Taub says her play having made it to Broadway, let alone being nominated for six Tony Awards, is \u201cbeyond her wildest dreams.\u201d \u201cI grew up as a theater kid who would kind of watch the Tonys with stars in my eyes. It is more than I could have ever imagined.\u201d She credits many for the success of the musical, but especially James: \u201cNikki's collaboration over these many years \u2014 she has stuck with us through thick and thin, through ups and downs \u2014 and through her portrayal and her collaboration, I think, has challenged the work to become better and deeper and mature.\"", "summary": "&#34;She really became a muse for me,&#34; Taub tells PEOPLE of fellow &#39;Suffs&#39; star Nikki M.

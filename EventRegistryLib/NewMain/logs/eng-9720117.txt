Star reveals decision", "body": "Lionel Messi has expressed his intention to continue playing for Argentina beyond the upcoming Copa America final.\n\nMessi has an impressive record of accomplishments throughout his time with Argentina. He was an integral part of his country's 2022 World Cup, and 2021 Copa America. The veteran also played in the revived 2022 Cup of Champions, which they won with a 3-0 victory against Mexico.\n\nThe superstar won the gold medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, adding to his collection of honors. Now, after defeating Canada 2-0 to go to the Copa America final, he is in a prime position to capture another major international trophy.\n\nThe 37-year-old made it to 109 goals for his country, his first in the competition so far this year. Now he's three goals short of the record for most in Copa America play, with fourteen. Right before the final whistle, the Inter Miami star had to cover his face with his hands to control his tears. It would be fitting for him to end his career on a high note by winning the Copa America, given everything he has accomplished.\n\nBut after the game, Messi stated, \"As I've said before, I intend to continue. I intend to keep living day by day without thinking about what will come in the future or whether I'll continue or not. It's something I just live each day. I'm 37 years and only God knows when the end will be.\"\n\nMessi, who scored his 109th international goal against Canada, has had a remarkable career with Argentina. He reversed his retirement decision after the 2016 Copa America final. Since then, he has scored 54 goals in 73 international appearances. His contributions helped Argentina win the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup. That solidified his legacy as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.\n\nThe journey of Lionel Scaloni's players to this edition of the Copa America final has been impressive. They reached their sixth final in eight editions of the tournament, with the 37-year-old playing a crucial role. Julian Alvarez gave Argentina the lead against Canada, and Messi extended it in the second half. This performance exemplifies the strong form Argentina has maintained under Messi's leadership.\n\nFor now, Messi remains focused on enjoying his time on the field and cherishing the moments with his team. He acknowledged the importance of savoring these experiences, especially as he and some of his teammates like Angel Di Maria are near the end of their international careers. Di Maria has confirmed that this will be his final tournament with Argentina. That adds a sentimental layer to their pursuit of another title.\n\nArgentina's head coach, Lionel Scaloni, had previously emphasized that Messi's place in the national team is secure for as long as he desires. \"We have to let him be and we will never be the ones to close the door. He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be.\"\n\nLa Seleccion will face either Uruguay or Colombia in the Copa America final. Messi and his teammates are focused on securing their third major title in three years, following their Copa America and World Cup triumphs. As they prepare for the final, Messi's message to his fans and teammates is clear: enjoy these moments and appreciate the journey.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica_Centenario", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240710_WST_515547_Messi-retire-Copa-America.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Messi has 28 goals in his last 25 matches for Argentina and 14 in Copa America play, three shy of the record. He has scored against 38 different nations.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if Enzo's ball was going to get in,\" Messi said. \"It was a reflex.\"\n\nOnly Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, with 130, has more international goals than Messi, who turned 37 on June 24. Iran's Ali Daei had 108 or 109 from 1993 to 2006, with a lingering dispute over whether a goal against Ecuador in 2000 occurred in a full international match.\n\nWith a victory on its Independence Day, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games. The Albiceleste seek a record 16th Copa title when they play Uruguay or Colombia on Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\n\"We have to enjoy every moment of what we're living,\" Messi said. \"I'm conscious that these are the last battles.\"\n\nTrying to string together Copa America titles around the 2022 World Cup championship, Argentina hopes to match Spain's feat of winning the 2008 and 2012 European Championships along with the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\"These are statistics. I'm not really interested in them,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said through a translator. \"The most important thing is to win.\"\n\nMaking his 38th Copa America appearance, Messi had missed Argentina's group stage finale with a leg injury and was subdued while playing 90 minutes in the quarterfinal win over Ecuador. He was much more agile and shot just wide in the 12th and 44th minutes.\n\nMetLife's temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles.\n\n\"It has been a very difficult Copa America,\" Messi said. \"Very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat.\"\n\nArgentina fans gathered in Times Square on the eve of the match and filled the streets of Manhattan before heading to MetLife Stadium. The crowd of 80,102 on a night with an 82-degree temperature and 82% humidity was overwhelmingly pro-Argentina, with only a few sections dominated by red-clad Canadian supporters.\n\nIt was among the biggest games for Canadian soccer, which went 0-6 in its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022 and won its only major title at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Argentina had beaten Canada 2-0 in the tournament opener on June 20.\n\n\"The tournament caught up with us a little bit,\" Canada coach Jesse Marsch said. \"There's been heat, there's been travel, there's been a lot of challenges. ... We're still at the beginnings of our process, right? Argentina's maybe had eight years together, seven years together with this team, and so we need to develop more players that can contribute so that we can also rotate in tournament play because eventually the physicality and the fatigue can catch up with you.\"\n\nCanada star Alphonso Davies limped off in the 71st minute after his right leg was caught in a clean challenge with Gonzalo Montiel.\n\n\"He's getting an X-ray, so we're hopeful he's OK, but we're not sure,\" Marsch said.\n\nCanada had two shots on target: Jonathan David was thwarted by Emiliano Mart\u00ednez from close range in first-half stoppage time, and Mart\u00ednez made a kick save on Tani Oluwaseyi in the 89th.\n\n\"We started getting sloppy. We started getting away from the game plan,\" said defender Derek Cornelius, who exchanged jerseys with Messi.\n\nWhile Messi referred to \"last battles,\" Scaloni and fans hold out hope Argentina and Messi will return to MetLife for the 2026 World Cup final.\n\n\"We will never be the ones to close the door,\" Scaloni said. \"He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be.\"", "source":

Messi has 28 goals in his past 25 matches for Argentina and 14 in Copa America play, three shy of the record.\n\nOnly Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo with 130 has more international goals than Messi, who turned 37 on June 24. Iran's Al Daei had 108 or 109 from 1993 to 2006, with a lingering dispute over whether his score against Ecuador in 2000 occurred in a full international match.\n\nWith a victory on its independence day, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games. The Albiceleste will be seeking a record 16th Copa America title when they play the winner of Wednesday's semifinal between Colombia and Uruguay on Sunday in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\n\"We have to enjoy every moment of what we're are living,\" Messi said. \"I'm conscious that these are the last battles.\"\n\nWith a chance to sandwich its 2022 World Cup title with consecutive Copa America crowns, Argentina is trying for a feat similar to when Spain won the 2008 and 2012 Euro championships along with the 2010 World Cup. If they pull it off, the Albiceleste would join La Roja as the only nations to win three straight major titles.\n\n\"It's insane what this team has done, what the Argentina national team is doing,\" Messi said. \"For those who remain from the old guard, it's beyond impressive that the national team is in another final.\"\n\nArgentina coach Lionel Scaloni, speaking through a translator, wasn't ready to reflect on something that hadn't yet happened.\n\n\"These are statistics. I'm not really interested about it,\" he said. \"The most important thing is to win.\"\n\nOn a night when the temperature was 82 degrees with 82% humidity at MetLife Stadium, the site of the 2026 World Cup final, the crowd of 80,102 was overwhelmingly rooting for Argentina, with only a few sections dominated by red-clad supporters of Canada.\n\nIt was one of the biggest soccer matches ever for the Canada men's national team, which went 0-6 in its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022 and won its only major title at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Argentina also beat Canada 2-0 in the Copa America opener for both teams on June 20.\n\nCanada star Alphonso Davies limped off after his right leg was caught in a clean challenge with Gonzalo Montiel, and he was replaced in the 71st minute.\n\n\"The tournament caught up with us a little bit,\" Canada coach Jesse Marsch said. \"There's been heat, there's been travel, there's been a lot of challenges. ... We're still at the beginnings of our process, right? Argentina's maybe had eight years together, seven years together with this team, and so we need to develop more players that can contribute so that we can also rotate in tournament play, because eventually the physicality and the fatigue can catch up with you.\"\n\nMessi, who made his 38th Copa America appearance, had missed Argentina's group stage finale with a leg injury and was subdued while playing 90 minutes in the quarterfinal win over Ecuador.\n\nAgainst Canada, he was just wide from the top of the penalty area in the 12th minute after exchanging passes with \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, then wide again in the 44th, and he put a chip over the crossbar in first-half injury time.\n\nMessi had 45 touches and a 79% pass success rate.\n\n\"They make us pay on small details,\" Cr\u00e9peau said.\n\nMetLife's temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles.\n\n\"It's has been a very difficult Copa Am\u00e9rica, very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat,\" Messi said.\n\nArgentina went ahead after Rodrigo De Paul, who was at the center circle, played a long pass to \u00c1lvarez, who took a touch at the top of the arc to control the ball against Canada's Mo\u00efse Bombito. \u00c1lvarez took another touch to create space from Bombito and from near the penalty spot slipped the ball between the legs of Cr\u00e9peau for his ninth goal in 35 international appearances.\n\nMessi scored after a throw-in. He centered the ball to De Paul, who ran to the end line and cut the ball back. Kon\u00e9's attempted clearance went to Fern\u00e1ndez, who teed up a shot that Messi redirected from just inside the 6-yard box.\n\n\"I just put myself in the middle of it,\" Messi said. \"I wasn't sure if Enzo's ball was going to get in. It was a reflex.\"\n\nCanada had two shots on target: Jonathan David was thwarted by Emiliano Mart\u00ednez from close range in first-half stoppage time, and Mart\u00ednez made a kick save on Tani Oluwaseyi in the 89th.\n\n\"We started getting sloppy. We started getting away from the game plan,\" said defender Derek Cornelius, who exchanged jerseys with Messi.\n\nWhile the Argentina star referred to \"last battles,\" Scaloni and fans hold out hope the team and Messi will return to this same venue for the 2026 World Cup final.\n\n\"We will never be the ones to close the door,\" Scaloni said. \"He can be with our team for as long as he wants to

The defending champions' victory was led by goals from Julian Alvarez and captain Lionel Messi, who scored his first goal of the tournament. Argentina will now face either Uruguay or Colombia, who play on Wednesday, in the final on Sunday in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nArgentina absorbed early pressure before Alvarez slipped between two defenders to score with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.

He narrowly missed from the top of the penalty area in the 12th minute after exchanging passes with Angel Di Maria and had other near misses in the 44th minute and first-half injury time.\n\nALSO READ | Euro 2024: Lamine Yamal Creates History, Becomes Youngest Ever Starter In Tournament Semis\n\nWith this victory Argentina extended their unbeaten streak to 10 games.

After this, much more importance will be given to all the finals that I and the old group had to play in,\" Messi said following the match at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\n\"We have to enjoy everything we are experiencing as a national team. What we have achieved is very difficult. We have to take advantage of it.\"\n\nMessi's life changed since his World Cup win.\n\nAnd before it changes again - with the 2026 World Cup or retirement in the near distance - he wants to soak it all in during this Copa America run to the final.\n\n\"These are the last battles, and I am enjoying them to the fullest,\" Messi said.\n\nNot just for him, but for his teammates like \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, the big-game scorer Messi needed to get the international monkey off his back. The Copa America final will be Di Mar\u00eda's final match with the Argentine national team.\n\n\"Before going out on the field, Leo said they wanted to reach the final for me, and that fills me with pride,\" Di Mar\u00eda said. \"Having that possibility of being able to achieve everything I achieved this last time with all of them is a source of pride for me.\"\n\nMessi also wants Argentine fans who have grown accustomed to their winning, the same ones who bemoaned him for not being able to win Copa America or the World Cup, to enjoy these moments.\n\nArgentina was a favorite to reach this final, fulfilling this sort of comfortable destiny and reputation of being World Cup champions.\n\nSure, a game-tying goal against Ecuador in the quarterfinals last week went to penalties, and Messi missed his shot. But no need to panic. Never a doubt.\n\nArgentina outmatched Canada, which earned the prize of meeting with the international juggernaut by outlasting the likes of Brazil, Venezuela and the United States to reach the Copa America final four.\n\n\"Yesterday, one of my colleagues was saying maybe we are normalizing these,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said. \"It is extremely tough to reach another final. We are carrying over a great level of praise with great success. We know how hard it is to get here.\"\n\nArgentina won Copa America 2021. It beat the Euro 2021 champions, Italy, in the 2022 Finalissima two summers ago. Argentina won the Qatar World Cup in 2022. Another Copa America crown would be Argentina's fourth major international championship in a three-year span.\n\nMessi wants his fans to savor and remember: This is a fleeting moment. Not everything lasts. He can tell you best.\n\nMessi's international success - the success he longed for his entire career when he was a Barcelona star - followed his Barcelona exit in 2021.\n\nAll that's left is Barcelona memories of his four UEFA Champions League crowns, seven Copa del Rey titles and 10 La Liga titles - appreciated more after his sour Paris Saint-Germain stint.\n\nAnd whether Messi plays in the next World Cup will depend on his health and desire, as he's indicated.\n\n\"We have to let him be,\" Scaloni said of Messi's comments. \"We will never be the ones to close the door. He can be with our team with as long as he wants to be.\"\n\nMessi hasn't closed the door just yet. He has another trophy to pursue before this all-time Argentina run comes to an end.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Superstar drops a hint after Argentina reach Copa America final", "body": "Lionel Messi of Argentina smiles during the semifinal match against Canada. -- AFP\n\nDefending champions Argentina booked their place in the Copa America final after goals from Julian Alvarez and Lionel Messi gave them a 2-0 win over Canada in Tuesday's semifinal in New Jersey.\n\nArgentina will face either Uruguay or Colombia in Sunday's final in Florida, a match that could represent the last shot at silverware for several senior squad members including Messi, Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi.\n\nMessi, 37, admitted after the match that the final on Sunday could be the last international match for some of the veterans in the team.\n\n\"Let's enjoy what we are experiencing as a national team, as a group. It is not easy to be in a final again, to compete again to be champions. I'm living it as I have been living everything lately: enjoying it very much and being aware, as it happens to Fideo (Di Maria) and Ota (Otamendi), that these are the last battles,\" Messi told TyC Sports in an apparent hint at retirement following the Copa America.\n\nArgentina have won a joint-record 15 Copa titles and reached the final six times in the past eight editions but Canada caused them real problems in the opening 20 minutes, Jacob Shaffelburg twice shooting wide from promising positions.\n\nAfter soaking up the early pressure, though, Argentina went ahead when Rodrigo De Paul played through Alvarez, who ghosted in between two defenders to score with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.\n\nArgentina, 2022 World Cup winners and number one in Fifa's rankings, gradually took control and Messi had a chance to double their lead in the 44th minute when he created space in the box with some silky footwork before lashing his effort wide.\n\nCanada nearly snatched an equaliser against the run of play in first-half stoppage time as Jonathan David sneaked in ahead of his marker to get on the end of a long throw, but his close-range shot was hit straight at goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.\n\nMessi had struggled with a muscle injury earlier in the tournament but appeared revitalised on a hot and humid evening at the MetLife Stadium.\n\nHe scored Argentina's second in the 51st minute, sticking out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.\n\nThe goal moved Messi to joint fifth in the all-time Copa America scoring charts, level with Peru's Paolo Guerrero and Chile's Eduardo Vargas, on 14.\n\nHis 109th goal for Argentina also saw him surpass Iran's Ali Daei to take sole possession of second place on the all-time international scoring charts.

These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum,\" Messi told TyC Sports after the semi-final triumph.\n\nAlthough it's not clear whether Messi will play his last Copa America event, Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni said their all-time highest goal-scorer can take his own time to decide his retirement.\n\n\"We have to leave him alone, he knows that we will not be the ones to close the door on him.

A sellout crowd is expected on Sunday with the cheapest tickets listed at $1,200. A halftime show by Colombian singer songwriter Shakira makes it an even hotter ticket.\n\nMessi scored his first goal this tournament on Tuesday night as Argentina knocked off surprise semifinalist Canada 2-0 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It is the sixth time Argentina makes the championship game in the past eight international tournaments it played in.\n\nLa Albiceleste reached the final of the 2014 and 2022 World Cups, and the Copa Americas in 2015, 2016, 2021, and 2024. The only two championships in the last eight that Argentina did not reach were the 2018 World Cup and the 2019 Copa America.\n\n\"It's crazy what this group has done, what the Argentine national team has been doing,\" Messi said to a group of reporters after the semifinal victory. \"After this, much more importance will be given to all the finals I played in, and to all the older generation players, me, Fide [Angel DiMaria], Ota [Nicolas Otamendi] and that Argentina can play another final is amazing. We must enjoy everything we are experiencing together as a group. What we have achieved is very difficult.\n\n\"To be honest, it has been a difficult tournament, the level has been as equal as ever, very bad surfaces, high temperatures that make it hard to play, very tough rivals. So, the fact we made it and we are here again playing a final is something to enjoy and highlight.\"\n\nAnd, this time, for a change, the team has not relied entirely on Messi.\n\nSure, the Argentine captain and Inter Miami star is still the face of the team and the absolute leader in the locker room and on the field. The players line up behind him in the tunnel before games like soldiers behind their general. At least one teammate has Messi's face tattooed on his torso.\n\nBut Argentina reached the semifinal without Messi scoring a single goal. He made nice passes, drew in defenders and created scoring opportunities for others. But the weight of the country was not fully on his shoulders.\n\nHis one goal was not the spectacular kind that has made highlight reels for decades.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner scored after Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez's shot deflected off Messi, who redirected it with a slight move of his foot, making it a tougher shot for Canada goalkeeper Maxime Cr\u00e9peau to save.\n\n\"I told Enzo it was not my intention to take the goal away from him, but I saw the goalkeeper fell down, the ball was going in slowly and I got my foot on it and redirected it a little bit,\" Messi said. \"The important thing is we scored.\"\n\nThe world is getting a glimpse of how this new-look Argentina team can continue to dominate in the twilight of Messi's career.\n\nMessi will be able to play in this final because of the performances of Emi Martinez, Lautaro Martinez, Alexis MacAllister, Julian Alvarez, Enzo Fernandez, Rodrigo DePaul, and others. His longtime teammate Angel DiMaria, 36, has said he will retire after this Copa America, making Sunday's game extra special.\n\nDi Mar\u00eda made his international debut in 2008 and has scored 31 goals in 144 appearances. Messi made a point in his pre-game speech to his teammates to dedicate the semifinal to DiMaria.\n\n\"Before we went onto the field Leo said they wanted to reach the final for me and that made me very proud,\" Di Maria said.\n\nAlthough Messi is a year older, he is not ready to call it quits on the national team just yet. If his body cooperates, it would not be far fetched to see him in the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\"As I've said before, I intend to continue,\" he told reporters on Tuesday night. \"I intend to keep living day by day without thinking about what will come in the future or whether I'll continue or not. It's something I just live each day. I'm 37 years and only God knows when the end will be.\"\n\nBut for now, he is living in the moment.\n\n\"Let's enjoy what we are experiencing as a national team, as a group. It is not easy to be in a final again, to compete again to be champions,\" Messi told TyC Sports. \"I'm living it as I have been living everything lately: enjoying it very much.\"\n\nDiMaria is ready to move on and has been asked about it during every Copa America interview.\n\n\"It's my last battle; there's nothing left to say that I haven't said a lot of times before,\" Di Mar\u00eda said. \"It's my last game. I want to thank all Argentineans and to this generation that has allowed me to lift so many trophies. It has been an honor.\"\n\nArgentina coach Lionel Scaloni was not ready to say farewell to DiMaria.\n\n\"We don't want to start crying right now. We don't want to feel sad,\" Scaloni said. \"We have to let him play and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us.\"\n\nSouth American World Cup qualifying resumes in September.\n\n\"We will never be the ones to close the door,\" Scaloni said about DiMaria. \"He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great. And if he wants to come with me to somewhere else, I will take him everywhere so he can decide whatever he wants to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakira", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shakira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Cr\u00e9peau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxime Cr\u00e9peau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TyC_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TyC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/miami_herald_mcclatchy_975/800b655002f83d8adae469b5faeeaf77", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Messi has 28 goals in his last 25 matches for Argentina and 14 in Copa America play, three shy of the record. He has scored against 38 different nations.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if Enzo's ball was going to get in,\" Messi said.\n\n\"It was a reflex.\"\n\nOnly Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo with 130 has more international goals than Messi, who turned 37 on June 24. Iran's Ali Daei had 108 or 109 from 1993 to 2006, with a lingering dispute over whether a goal against Ecuador in 2000 occurred in a full international match.\n\nWith a victory on its independence day, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games. The Albiceleste seek a record 16th Copa title when they play Uruguay or Colombia on Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\n\"We have to enjoy every moment of what we're are living,\" Messi said. \"I'm conscious that these are the last battles.\" Trying to string together Copa America titles around the 2022 World Cup championship, Argentina is trying to match Spain's feat of winning the 2008 and 2012 European Championships along with the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\"These are statistics. I'm not really interested about it,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said through a translator.\n\n\"The most important thing is to win.\"\n\nMaking his 38th Copa America appearance, Messi had missed Argentina's group stage finale with a leg injury and was subdued while playing 90 minutes in the quarterfinal win over Ecuador. He was much more agile and shot just wide in the 12th and 44th minutes.\n\nMetLife's temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles.\n\n\"It's has been a very difficult Copa Am\u00e9rica,\" Messi said, \"very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat.\" Argentina fans gathered in Times Square on the eve of the match and filled the streets on Manhattan before heading to MetLife Stadium. The crowd of 80,102 on a night with an 82-degree temperature and 82% humidity was overwhelmingly pro-Argentina, with only a few sections dominated by red-clad Canadian supporters.", "source": {"uri":

Messi has 28 goals in his last 25 matches for Argentina and 14 in Copa America play, three shy of the record.\n\nOnly Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo with 130 has more international goals than Messi, who turned 37 on June 24. Iran's Al Daei had 108 or 109 from 1993 to 2006, with a lingering dispute over whether a goal against Ecuador in 2000 occurred in a full international match.\n\nWith a victory on its independence day, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games. Argentina seeks a record 16th Copa title when they play Uruguay or Colombia on Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nTrying to string together championships in consecutive Copa Americas around the 2022 World Cup championship, Argentina is trying to match the feat of Spain when La Roja won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships along with the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\"It's insane what this team has done, what the Argentina national team is doing,\" Messi said. \"For those who remain from the old guard, it's beyond impressive that the national team is in another final.\"\n\nArgentina fans gathered in Times Square on the eve of the match and filled the streets on Manhattan before heading to MetLife Stadium, site of the 2026 World Cup final. The crowd of 80,102 on a night with an 82-degree temperature and 82% humidity was overwhelmingly pro-Argentina, with only a few sections dominated by red-clad Canadian supporters.\n\nIt was among the biggest games for Canadian soccer, which went 0-6 in its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022 and won its only major title at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Argentina had beaten Canada 2-0 in the tournament opener on June 20.\n\nCanada star Alphonso Davies limped off after his right leg was caught in a clean challenge with Gonzalo Montiel and he was replaced in the 71st minute.\n\nMaking his 38th Copa America appearance, Messi had missed Argentina's group stage finale with a leg injury and was subdued while playing 90 minutes in the quarterfinal win over Ecuador.\n\nHe was just wide from the top of the penalty area in the 12th minute after exchanging passes with Angel Di Maria, then wide again in the 44th and put a chip over the crossbar in first-half injury time.\n\nMetLife's temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles.\n\n\"It's has been a very difficult Copa America, very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat,\" Messi said.\n\nArgentina went ahead after Rodrigo De Paul from the center circle played a long pass to Alvarez, who took a touch at the top of the arc to control the ball from Moise Bombito. Alvarez took another touch to create space from Bombito and from near the penalty spot slipped the ball between the legs of Crepeau for his ninth goal in 35 international appearances.\n\nMessi scored following a throw-in. He centered the ball to De Paul, who ran to the end line and cut the ball back. Kon\u00e9's attempted clearance went to Fern\u00e1ndez, who teed up a shot that Messi redirected from just inside the 6-yard box.\n\n\"I just put myself in the middle of it,\" Messi said. \"I wasn't sure if Enzo's ball was going to get in. It was a reflex.\"\n\nJonathan David was thwarted by Emiliano Mart\u00ednez from close range in first-half stoppage time, and Martinez made a kick save on Tani Oluwaseyi in the 80th.\n\nEUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nSPAIN 2, FRANCE 1\n\nMUNICH -- Lamine Yamal, 16, became the youngest player ever to score at the European Championship when he netted a stunning goal for Spain in its semifinal 2-1 victory over France on Tuesday.\n\nYamal will turn 17 on Saturday, a day before the final in Berlin against either England or the Netherlands.\n\n\"I only ask to win, win and win,\" said Yamal, who was voted player of the match. \"I will celebrate my birthday in Germany with my team.\"\n\nYamal struck in the 21st minute, curling the ball past France goalkeeper Mike Maignan from around 25 yards and into the top left corner.\n\n\"I don't know if it is the best goal of the tournament, but it is the most special goal for me because it is my first goal with the team at a European Championship,\" he said.\n\nYamal is 16 years and 362 days old. The previous youngest scorer at a European Championship was Swiss player Johan Vonlanthen (18 years, 141 days), against France at Euro 2004.\n\n\"We are very happy to reach the final. Now comes the most important part -- winning the title,\" Yamal said. \"We were in a difficult stretch after not expecting to concede so early. I just took the ball and wanted to put it right there.\n\n\"I don't try to think about it too much, just enjoy myself and help the team, and if it goes my way, then I am happy (for the goal) and for the win.\"\n\nArgentina's Lionel Messi is congratulated after scoring his side's second goal against Canada during a Copa America semifinal soccer match in East Rutherford, N.J., Tuesday, July 9, 2024.

Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez put the Albiceleste ahead in the 22nd minute and Messi redirected Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez's shot in off the face of goalkeeper Maxime Cr\u00e9peau in the 51st. Messi has 28 goals in his last 25 matches for Argentina and 14 in Copa America play, three shy of the record. Only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo with 130 has more international goals than Messi, who turned 37 on June 24. Iran's Al Daei had 108 or 109 from 1993 to 2006, with a lingering dispute over whether a goal against Ecuador in 2000 occurred in a full international match. With a victory on its independence day, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games. The Albiceleste seek a record 16th Copa title when they play Uruguay or Colombia on Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida. Trying to string together championships in consecutive Copa Americas around the 2022 World Cup championship, Argentina is trying to match the feat of Spain when La Roja won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships along with the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\"It's insane what this team has done, what the Argentina national team is doing,\" Messi said. \"For those who remain from the old guard, it's beyond impressive that the national team is in another final.\" Argentina fans gathered in Times Square on the eve of the match and filled the streets on Manhattan before heading to MetLife Stadium, site of the 2026 World Cup final. The crowd of 80,102 on a night with an 82-degree temperature and 82% humidity was overwhelmingly pro-Argentina, with only a few sections dominated by red-clad Canadian supporters. It was among the biggest games for Canadian soccer, which went 0-6 in its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022 and won its only major title at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso Read: Leo Messi becomes most capped player as Argentina defeat Canada 2-0\n\nArgentina had beaten Canada 2-0 in the tournament opener on June 20. Canada star Alphonso Davies limped off after his right leg was caught in a clean challenge with Gonzalo Montiel and he was replaced in the 71st minute. Making his 38th Copa America appearance, Messi had missed Argentina's group stage finale with a leg injury and was subdued while playing 90 minutes in the quarterfinal win over Ecuador. He was just wide from the top of the penalty area in the 12th minute after exchanging passes with \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, then wide again in the 44th and put a chip over the crossbar in first-half injury time. MetLife's temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles.\n\n\"It's has been a very difficult Copa Am\u00e9rica, very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat,\" Messi said. Argentina went ahead after Rodrigo De Paul from the center circle played a long pass to \u00c1lvarez, who took a touch at the top of the arc to control the ball from Mo\u00efse Bombito. \u00c1lvarez took another touch to create space from Bombito and from near the penalty spot slipped the ball between the legs of Cr\u00e9peau for his ninth goal in 35 international appearances. Messi scored following a throw-in. He centered the ball to De Paul, who ran to the end line and cut the ball back. Kon\u00e9's attempted clearance went to Fern\u00e1ndez, who teed up a shot that Messi redirected from just inside the 6-yard box. \"I just put myself in the middle of it,\" Messi said. \"I wasn't sure if Enzo's ball was going to get in. It was a reflex.\" Jonathan David was thwarted by Emiliano Mart\u00ednez from close range in first-half stoppage time, and Mart\u00ednez made a kick save on Tani Oluwaseyi in the 80th.", "source":

He also missed a match as he was nursing a right groin/adductor injury, but he has since returned and in the last two matches has looked closer to his best.\n\nAlvarez had scored in the 23rd minute, after getting onto the end of a pass from Rodrigo De Paul and sneaking in behind his marker, he gave Argentina an early lead with a well taken shot.\n\nThe legendary attacker took time to reflect on what the Argentina group of the last few years has already achieved.\n\nHe believes that the last few matches involving the group will be something really special.\n\n\"It's crazy what this group did, what the Argentine national team has been doing,\" Messi said after the game.\n\n\"After this, much more importance will be given to all the finals that I and all of the old group had to play in.\"\n\nArgentina will face either Colombia or Uruguay in the Copa America final which will be played in Messi's current base of Miami.\n\nNot only are Argentina the reigning world champions they are also out to retain their Copa America title.\n\nArgentine coach Lionel Scaloni cut a relieved figure after the match.\n\n\"It is extremely tough to reach another final,\" Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\n\"We are carrying a great level of praise with great success.

(AP) -- Lionel Messi scored his 109th international goal and first of the tournament, leading defending champion Argentina over Canada 2-0 on Tuesday night and into the Copa America final.\n\nJuli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez put the Albiceleste ahead in the 22nd minute and Messi redirected Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez's shot in off the face of goalkeeper Maxime Cr\u00e9peau in the 51st. Messi has 28 goals in his last 25 matches for Argentina and 14 in Copa America play, three shy of the record.\n\nOnly Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo with 130 has more international goals than Messi, who turned 37 on June 24. Iran's Al Daei had 108 or 109 from 1993 to 2006, with a lingering dispute over whether a goal against Ecuador in 2000 occurred in a full international match.\n\nWith a victory on its independence day, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games. The Albiceleste seek a record 16th Copa title when they play Uruguay or Colombia on Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nTrying to string together championships in consecutive Copa Americas around the 2022 World Cup championship, Argentina is trying to match the feat of Spain when La Roja won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships along with the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\"It's insane what this team has done, what the Argentina national team is doing,\" Messi said. \"For those who remain from the old guard, it's beyond impressive that the national team is in another final.\"\n\nArgentina fans gathered in Times Square on the eve of the match and filled the streets on Manhattan before heading to MetLife Stadium, site of the 2026 World Cup final. The crowd of 80,102 on a night with an 82-degree temperature and 82% humidity was overwhelmingly pro-Argentina, with only a few sections dominated by red-clad Canadian supporters.\n\nIt was among the biggest games for Canadian soccer, which went 0-6 in its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022 and won its only major title at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Argentina had beaten Canada 2-0 in the tournament opener on June 20.\n\nCanada star Alphonso Davies limped off after his right leg was caught in a clean challenge with Gonzalo Montiel and he was replaced in the 71st minute.\n\nMaking his 38th Copa America appearance, Messi had missed Argentina's group stage finale with a leg injury and was subdued while playing 90 minutes in the quarterfinal win over Ecuador.\n\nHe was just wide from the top of the penalty area in the 12th minute after exchanging passes with \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, then wide again in the 44th and put a chip over the crossbar in first-half injury time.\n\nMetLife's temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles.\n\n\"It's has been a very difficult Copa Am\u00e9rica, very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat,\" Messi said.\n\nArgentina went ahead after Rodrigo De Paul from the center circle played a long pass to \u00c1lvarez, who took a touch at the top of the arc to control the ball from Mo\u00efse Bombito. \u00c1lvarez took another touch to create space from Bombito and from near the penalty spot slipped the ball between the legs of Cr\u00e9peau for his ninth goal in 35 international appearances.\n\nMessi scored following a throw-in. He centered the ball to De Paul, who ran to the end line and cut the ball back. Kon\u00e9's attempted clearance went to Fern\u00e1ndez, who teed up a shot that Messi redirected from just inside the 6-yard box.\n\n\"I just put myself in the middle of it,\" Messi said. \"I wasn't sure if Enzo's ball was going to get in. It was a reflex.\"\n\nJonathan David was thwarted by Emiliano Mart\u00ednez from close range in first-half stoppage time, and Mart\u00ednez made a kick save on Tani Oluwaseyi in the 80th.\n\n___\n\nAP

It is not easy to be in a final again, to compete again to be champions,\" Lionel Messi told TyC Sports.\n\n\"I'm living it as I have been living everything lately: enjoying it very much and being aware, as it happens to Fideo (Di Maria) and Ota (Otamendi), that these are the last battles.\"\n\nArgentina have won a joint-record 15 Copa titles and reached the final six times in the past eight editions but Canada caused them real problems in the opening 20 minutes, Jacob Shaffelburg twice shooting wide from promising positions.\n\nAfter soaking up the early pressure, though, Argentina went ahead when Rodrigo De Paul played through Alvarez, who ghosted in between two defenders to score with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.\n\nArgentina, 2022 World Cup winners and number one in FIFA's rankings, gradually took control and Messi had a chance to double their lead in the 44th minute when he created space in the box with some silky footwork before lashing his effort wide.\n\nCanada nearly snatched an equaliser against the run of play in first-half stoppage time as Jonathan David sneaked in ahead of his marker to get on the end of a long throw, but his close-range shot was hit straight at goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.\n\nLionel Messi had struggled with a muscle injury earlier in the tournament but appeared revitalised on a hot and humid evening at the MetLife Stadium.\n\nRead more: Euro 2024 semi-final is just another game: Declan Rice\n\nHe scored Argentina's second in the 51st minute, sticking out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.\n\nThe goal moved Messi to joint fifth in the all-time Copa America scoring charts, level with Peru's Paolo Guerrero and Chile's Eduardo Vargas, on 14.\n\nHis 109th goal for Argentina also saw him surpass Iran's Ali Daei to take sole possession of second place on the all-time international scoring charts. Messi trails only Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 130 goals for Portugal.\n\nDespite their two-goal cushion, Argentina had a nervy finish to the match as Canada substitute Tani Oluwaseyi tested Martinez with a crisp shot in the 89th minute before directing a glancing header wide a minute later.\n\nFor Canada, the defeat ends a remarkable run in which they defied expectations and performed better than their higher-ranked CONCACAF rivals Mexico and the United States, their fellow co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\"They're the best team in the world, but at the same time we had our chances in the beginning of the game,\" midfielder Stephen Eustaquio told Canadian broadcaster TSN.\n\n\"If we scored one of our chances, the story of the game would probably have been different. To get here, the last four of the Copa America, it's a big achievement.\"", "source": {"uri": "arynews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARY NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@arynews.tv", "name":

Let's enjoy everything that we are living and enjoying as a national team. It is not easy to get to another final. We have to take advantage because it's not something easy These are some of my last battles and I have to enjoy,\" Messi was quoted by Mirror.\n\n\"It's crazy what this group has been doing, what the Argentine National Team has been doing, because a lot of importance is being given to the finals that I and all of the old team played in. It's amazing that we're in a new final. It wasn't an easy cup: very tough teams, very bad pitches, the heat makes it very hard. It's worth enjoying being in a new final,\" he added.\n\nMessi's career with Argentina is decorated with multiple notable achievements. He led his nation to glory as the 2022 FIFA World Cup champion, the 2021 Copa America winner, and the 2022 UEFA Cup of Champions winner with a 3-0 win over Mexico.

Getty Images\n\nLionel Messi said he was left in awe after Argentina and some of its remaining \"old guard\" defeated Canada 2-0 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, to qualify for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica final.\n\nMessi scored his first goal at this year's Copa and the 14th of his career in the second half to double the lead Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez staked Argentina to with his first-half strike.\n\n\"What this team has done, what the Argentina national team has done, because after this everyone gives more importance to all the finals that me and the 'older guys' have played,\" Messi said after the match. \"Me, Fide [\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda], Ota [Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi] and that Argentina can play another final is amazing.\n\n\"To be honest, it has been a difficult tournament, the level has been as equal as ever, very bad surfaces, high temperatures that make it hard to play, very tough rivals. So, the fact we made it and we are here again playing a final is something to enjoy and highlight.\"\n\nLa Albiceleste returns to the final game of the tournament for the second consecutive time, after featuring in the 2021 edition, and stands on the brink of winning the country's 16th Copa Am\u00e9rica title -- which would pull them ahead of Uruguay for the most all time.\n\nArgentina manager Lionel Scaloni expressed excitement over reaching this point of the competition, before warning of the difficulties that lie ahead for his squad.\n\n\"It's something to be proud of and grateful to the players for,\" Scaloni said. \"Yesterday, a colleague asked me if we normalize this, but the question was good and I wasn't clear. It's super difficult to be in a final, especially coming in the way we did with previous success and triumph. It's double as hard.\n\n\"The ones on the inside know how difficult it is to reach this point. It's a sensation of happiness but also worry, because it costs more.\"\n\nArgentina topped Group A by beating Canada, Chile and Peru, before going on to beat Ecuador in a shootout to reach the semifinal. Messi & Co. then dispatched Canada in the semifinal by the same scoreline as it did in group play at 2-0.\n\nNow, Argentina prepares to face either Uruguay or Colombia in what could be the final game for Di Mar\u00eda and Messi.\n\n\"You know how I think: We wait and see how he plays,\" Scaloni said of Di Mar\u00eda. \"We won't retire him early before the game, then the tears will start and everyone, his family, will get melancholic. We'll see later if we convince him or not convince him, but for now, we let him play.\n\n\"It's the same case for Messi. We leave them calm from our part; we won't be the ones to close the door on them. He can be with us until he wants, and even after he retires, he can join me if I'm still coach. And if not, I'll take him where I go. He would be a great help.\"\n\nArgentina will travel to Miami -- where Messi competes for club side Inter Miami CF -- to play the Copa Am\u00e9rica final at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.\n\nAsked whether he will play beyond Copa Am\u00e9rica, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner insisted he has no plans yet to retire.\n\n\"As I've said before, I intend to continue,\" he said Tuesday night. \"I intend to keep living day by day without thinking about what will come in the future or whether I'll continue or not. It's something I just live each day. I'm 37 years and only God knows when the end will be.\"\n\nHe was speaking outside the locker room at MetLife Stadium, where in 2016 he had announced his retirement after missing a penalty kick in the Copa Am\u00e9rica final shootout loss to Chile.\n\nMessi reversed his decision seven weeks later and has since scored 54 goals in 73 international appearances, raising his matches for Argentina to 186 as he helped win the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 2022 World Cup.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with

Argentina had just seen off Canada to force passage into another major final, their team's relentless form of the past five years maintained and conviction bolstered that they will retain the Copa America title won four years ago.\n\n\"This is so beautiful, and it's something we should value,\" Messi said. \"I've been saying that to play in another final, to play in four straight finals... what this group of players is doing is something to be proud of. We should value it and recognize it.\"\n\nThere is little doubt now that this group of players -- led by Messi, their venerable captain -- are the best Argentina team of all time.\n\nThe Copa's defending champions have lost just twice in 61 matches, a sequence stretching back half a decade. In that time they have won the 2021 Copa America, the 2022 World Cup and the inaugural Finalissima against European champions Italy in 2023. Beating Canada 2-0 on Tuesday night at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, already confirmed as the venue for the 2026 World Cup final, leaves Argentina 90 minutes away from another major tournament trophy.\n\nMessi has now led his national team to seven finals. But before lifting the Copa America trophy in 2021, he had only suffered crushing defeats on the grandest stages, which clouded his legacy with Argentina.\n\nThe 2014 team that lost to Germany in a World Cup final that went to extra time featured many of the same players who then lost the 2015 and 2016 Copa America finals. In recent years, Messi has made an effort to honor the teams and players deemed losers by Argentina's fanatical footballing culture. Today, Argentina's players are national heroes who have shown an unrelenting hunger to win.\n\nThe stadiums in which they have played in the United States over the three weeks of this tournament so far have been filled to the brim with fans clad in blue and white. Back in Buenos Aires, the country is eager to celebrate another title. There is a belief that this team have fortune on their side, unlike those sides who faltered in their biggest moments before 2021.\n\n\"We've done this before and it wasn't valued, maybe because we weren't lucky enough to win,\" said Messi. \"Those teams also played in Copa America and World Cup finals. But now we need to enjoy this moment.\n\n\"The people (of Argentina) deserve to stick their chests out and enjoy this Argentina national team and all its accomplishments. We're in another final and we're still competing.\"\n\nMessi scored Argentina's second goal against Canada, taking his tally at international level to 109 -- the second-most of all time behind Cristiano Ronaldo's 130 for Portugal. It was actually his first goal of the tournament, a reflection that this has been a nondescript Copa America for Argentina's talisman.\n\nAn adductor (groin) injury suffered in Argentina's second game of the group stage forced him to miss one match. Argentina, though, carried on without him, easily winning their group. That is what makes this Argentina team special. They are deep in nearly every position.\n\nA player such as Julian Alvarez can be swapped with Serie A's leading goalscorer Lautaro Martinez if necessary. The back line is as stout as any group of defenders in the world, led by Tottenham's Cristian Romero. They have full-backs with different profiles; Nahuel Molina and Marcos Acuna are sure-footed defenders, while Gonzalo Montiel and Nicolas Tagliafico are man-marking bulldogs.\n\nArgentina's midfield is the strength of the team. Rodrigo De Paul, in tears after the final whistle due to the physical sacrifice the Canada match required, plays alongside two Premier League No 8s in Alexis Mac Allister and Enzo Fernandez. Both players attack and defend persistently, which allows Messi and Angel Di Maria to pick their moments to press and focus on chance creation.\n\nSince head coach Lionel Scaloni took over in 2019, Argentina has been defined by their depth and tactical flexibility, while maintaining an identity centered on dominating possession and controlling matches from beginning to end. Di Maria has said publicly that he will retire from international football after this Copa America. The 36-year-old will now have a unique opportunity to walk away after winning yet another trophy.\n\n\"I don't think I'd be able to have dreamt this,\" Di Maria said. \"I'm so grateful to this generation of players, because it's thanks to them I've been able to accomplish all of this. It's thanks to them that my last game with the national team will be a final.\n\n\"There have been some bad times -- sometimes you have to get walked over. But this is how it had to end. With me lifting the (World Cup) trophy and playing in another final with this shirt.\"\n\nMessi, who turned 37 last month, referred to this moment in his career, and that of Di Maria and veteran defender Nicolas Otamendi, also 36, as \"our last battles\". On Tuesday, he stressed that the road to continued success has been difficult. Argentina is not a team that routs its opponents. Every match is filled with tension and anxiety, followed by a celebratory roar when Argentina's goals find the opponents' net.\n\nAt the other end of the field, Argentina has a goalkeeper who has become nearly impossible to beat. Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez gives the current world champions an edge that makes them easy to dislike. Villainy in sport is a sign of success. But as he grinned widely in the bowels of the MetLife Stadium post-match, Martinez seemed in awe of his team's ascendancy.\n\n\"I can't believe it, I can't believe this,\" he said. \"You have to believe but keep your feet on the ground, with the mentality that all of this is possible.\"\n\nAsked if he felt Argentina was the tournament's best team, Martinez shook his head humbly. \"There are a lot of good teams,\" said Martinez. \"Look at Brazil (out in the quarterfinals). The pitches (being used for this Copa) are f***ed and any team can challenge you. Uruguay looks really good and Colombia hasn't lost in almost 30 games. (Those two sides meet in the second semifinal on Wednesday night). It's going to be tough.\"\n\nScaloni himself has teetered on the edge of despair even as Argentina continued to win. He nearly walked away from the national team last November, after a historic World Cup qualifying win over Brazil in Rio de Janeiro. \"I need to stop the ball and start thinking -- I have a lot of things to think about during this time,\" Scaloni said then.\n\nAfter last night's win over Canada, Scaloni looked like a coach who had regained his purpose. He was visibly elated. \"We're coming from a lot of success and that makes everything more difficult -- it costs so much more,\" he said. Scaloni deflected all questions about Argentina's impressive run of three consecutive finals wins. \"We're focused on winning this final.\"\n\nScaloni told reporters that Messi's future will be determined by the player. He and his staff will never close the door on the veteran. In fact, Scaloni stressed Messi can remain a part of the national team for as long as he wishes. \"I'll take him with me if I go somewhere else,\" Scaloni said. \"He'd be a great help to me, but it'll be up to him.\"\n\nA few steps away, surrounded by hordes of reporters from around the world, Messi continued to enjoy the limelight.\n\nIt must be incredibly hard for him to consider walking away from this. He adores this group of players and they, in turn, idolize him. A win in the Copa America final on Sunday (early Monday UK time) in Miami, where he now plays his club football with Inter Miami of MLS, could be the catalyst that prolongs Messi's international career through to the 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Alternatively, a fourth straight trophy might prompt him to hang up his boots as a hero.\n\nFor now, Messi is as happy as he has ever been, and so is the country of Argentina.\n\n\"Argentines are crazy about this national team and crazy about football,\" Messi added. \"This group (of players) has been fostering that relationship for a long time now. We've won important things and these players continue to compete game after game. We don't always play well, but our willingness to compete is spectacular.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Albiceleste triumphed over a spirited Canada with a 2-0 victory in the semi-final held in front of a packed house in New Jersey on Tuesday.\n\nMessi's performance was nothing short of spectacular. Scoring his 14th goal in Copa America, he moved level with Peru's Paolo Guerrero and Chile's Eduardo Vargas, just three goals shy of the tournament's all-time record. This feat also pushed Messi to second place on the all-time list of international goal scorers. With his 109th international goal, he surpassed Iran's Ali Daei, now trailing only Cristiano Ronaldo, who leads with 130 goals.\n\nAlso read: Photo of Messi blessing 'baby' Yamal resurfaces as Spaniard makes Euros history in semi-final win over France\n\nIn his last 25 matches for Argentina, Messi has netted 28 goals, showcasing his consistent excellence.

In contrast, Cristiano Ronaldo's hopes of winning another silverware with Portugal ended when they were knocked out by France on penalties in the Euro 2024 quarter-final.\n\nThe semi-final saw goals from Messi and Julian Alvarez, securing Argentina's place in the final for the seventh time. As 15-time champions, Argentina's dominance in the tournament is well-established.\n\n\"It is insane what this team has done, what the Argentina national team is doing. For those who remain from the old guard, it's beyond impressive that the national team is in another final,\" Messi expressed after the victory. Argentina will face either Uruguay or Colombia in the final in Florida.\n\n\"LETTSSS GOOOO!!! ON TO THE FINALS!!! Very happy to make it again to the last Copa America match. We still have one more step to go...\" Messi wrote on Instagram, reflecting his excitement and determination.\n\nArgentina is on the brink of emulating Spain's remarkable achievement of winning two continental tournament titles around a World Cup triumph. Messi's team clinched the Copa America in 2021 and lifted the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022. Spain achieved a similar feat by winning the Euros in 2008 and 2012, along with the FIFA World Cup in 2010.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Guerrero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paolo Guerrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Daei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Daei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j2dgm8xj5g90ngqmps5sr0pm/whatsapp-image-2024-07-10-at-10-29-40.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It will be the seventh senior international final of his career, having won each of his last two in 2021 and 2022.\n\nBut while the world has been speculating about whether 39-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo will continue to play for Portugal following Euro 2024, a 37-year-old Messi insists he definitely won't quit just yet.\n\n\"As I've said before, I intend to continue,\" the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner said. \"I intend to keep living day by day without thinking about what will come in the future or whether I'll continue or not. It's something I just live each day. I'm 37 years and only God knows when the end will be.\"\n\nMessi won Olympic gold with Argentina in 2008 but endured disappointment after disappointment when it came to the senior side. As a 20-year-old, he was part of the squad that lost in the 2007 Copa America final against fierce rivals Brazil. In 2014, Argentina lost the World Cup final against Germany, while there were then successive final defeats to Chile in 2015 and 2016 Copa Americas.\n\nAfter an underwhelming World Cup in 2018 ended at the first knockout round, and with Ronaldo finally getting his hands on international silverware in 2016 at the European Championship, questions were increasingly asked if Messi would ever land that elusive trophy with his country.\n\nThat finally changed three years ago when Argentina reached the Copa America final again, but this time emerged victorious courtesy of a single goal from Angel Di Maria. A year after that, it was the World Cup in Qatar, with Messi landing the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player.\n\nArgentina will face either Colombia or Uruguay in the final. Whatever happens, it will be Di Maria's last game in the famous blue and white stripes - the 36-year-old winger has announced his intention to step away from the national team after 16 years and nearly 150 games.\n\n\"I'm not ready for my last game in the national team, but it's time. Whatever happens in the final, I think I can leave through the front door. I gave everything,\" Di Maria explained.\n\n\"I always gave my life for this shirt. There were times when I didn't get to, but lately I have. I am grateful to everyone who supported me.\"\n\nDi Maria has played in four of Argentina's five games so far and is tipped to take his club career back to South America once the tournament is over, to rejoin boyhood club Rosario Central. He originally left for Portugal way back in 2007 at the age of 19 and after only 39 first-team games.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cl\u00e1sico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Cl\u00e1sico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rosario Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4234,h_2381,x_0,y_47/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j2ewy8d1k6njpy97ad.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

La Albiceleste defeated Canada 2-0 on Tuesday night in MetLife Stadium to advance to the Copa America Final.\n\nThey await the victor of Wednesday's showdown between Uruguay and Colombia. If Argentina can win the tournament for a second consecutive time, they will have claimed three straight international crowns. Breathing that rarefied air would launch this squad into the same all-time great conversation as the late-2000s and early-2010s Spain team.\n\nRegardless of how everything concludes in the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium this Sunday, Argentina is a certified juggernaut that will forever be remembered. And Messi will be considered the consensus greatest player to ever lace up a pair of cleats.\n\n\"It's crazy what this group did, what the Argentine national team has been doing,\" Messi said, per Jared Schwartz of the New York Post. \"It's not easy to be in a final again. We need to enjoy, enjoy every moment.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old iced the game by scoring Argentina's second goal in the 51st minute of the semifinal matchup. He made his opponent pay for an errant pass in the danger zone and tapped in a pass from Enzo Fernandez for his first goal of the 2024 Copa America. Even at less than full strength- had been dealing with a leg injury -- Lionel Messi found a way to make more history and captivate the masses.\n\nHis legacy, and that of the entire group, just keeps soaring to absurd heights. And to think that this man briefly retired from the national team in 2016 after losing to Chile in the Copa Final. Life is funny, huh.\n\nCan Lionel Messi, Argentina be stopped?\n\nMessi is naturally the face of this historic run, but Argentina boasts plenty of individuals worthy of the spotlight. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez made a terrific save at the end of the first half to keep his team in the driver's seat, Julian Alvarez broke loose for the first goal in the 22nd minute and manager Lionel Scaloni made sure his guys executed the game plan accordingly.\n\nIt is easy to take for granted this win, especially given Canada's huge underdog status entering the matchup, but Messi knows how unforgiving the Copa America can be from his past triumphs and pitfalls.\n\n\"It is a difficult cup, very tough, with heavy temperatures,\" he said. \"That we are in a final again is something to highlight.\"\n\nThe end is near for Lionel Messi, and by extension this iteration of Argentinian soccer, but he, his teammates and their countless fans are soaking up all the excitement that comes from this legendary era. That does not mean it is time to celebrate, however.\n\nThis nation has never won back-to-back Copa America championships. While there will be pressure on La Albiceleste to finish the job, it is safe to say that the crowd will overwhelmingly be in their corner.

Only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, who has 130, tops him.\n\nThe messianic chants from the crowd of more than 80,000 at an overheated MetLife -- \"Messi! Messi! Messi!\" -- soon followed.\n\nCanada was the surprise underdog opponent, looking to pull off a monumental upset after an already expectation-defying run in the tournament. The Canadian border sits less than 300 miles north of MetLife; Buenos Aires sits some 5,300 miles to the south. An American, Jesse Marsch, coaches the Canadian team.\n\nNo matter. Fans of Argentina outnumbered those wearing Canadian red by a healthy margin. It was a home game, far from home, for the defending World Cup champion.\n\nForgive anyone whose mind began to wander. A little more than two years from now, MetLife Stadium will host the 2026 World Cup Final. Messi teased his legions by scoring a goal here: Could he return to clinch a second straight World Cup and cement his already incredible legacy in some sort of unbreakable limestone? Through his Major League Soccer signing and stellar play with Inter Miami, he's already elevated soccer in the United States beyond prior imagination.\n\nHe'll be 39 at the next World Cup, but still looks quite spry. Why wouldn't he just finish the deal?\n\nBut first, there's the non-trivial matter of winning another international championship. Argentina won the last Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2021 in Brazil, its first title in that tournament in 28 years. On Sunday, in Miami, Argentina will face the winner of Wednesday's second semifinal, between Uruguay and Colombia, to try to complete the Copa repeat.\n\nMessi missed a few scoring chances in the first half, but Argentina still took the lead. Argentina's Rodrigo De Paul was given too much room to operate in front of midfield: he chipped a beautiful ball to Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, who finished to give Argentina a 1-0 advantage it would take into the half. Canada could have made things interesting near the end, but Tani Oluwaseyi sent a header wide in the 89th minute.\n\nCanada's disappointing loss didn't stop Marsch, the American whom Canada hired in mid-May as national team coach, from going right to his players and hugging them, one by one, after the final whistle. He's known for stressing interpersonal joy among his teams and has brought that philosophy up north. The U.S. failed to make it out of the group stage at this home Copa Am\u00e9rica, sparking another round of speculation about the fitness of coach Gregg Berhalter for his job. U.S. Soccer passed over Marsch for its national team opening last year.\n\n\"I took this job seven weeks ago,\" Marsch said in his post-game press conference. \"I couldn't have imagined that I'd be right here, right now. So I'm really happy with the team and really happy with our performance.\"\n\n\"Everyone thought it was going to be a path of roses,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said in Spanish after the match. \"That it was going to be very easy. Today Canada showed it is a difficult rival.\"\n\nScaloni waved off any concerns about the New Jersey heat on Tuesday draining his players for the final. \"No excuse,\" he told reporters. \"We have time to rest, we have time to prepare.\"\n\nFor one more time -- at least -- the world will get to witness Messi chase another international title on Sunday. And while Messi has expressed some uncertainty about sticking around for the 2026 World Cup, telling reporters after the match that he was enjoying his \"last battles,\" Scaloni stressed that the No. 10 has a lifetime membership with Argentina, no matter what.\n\n\"We will never close the door on Messi,\" said Scaloni. \"He can be with us whenever he wants, even after he retires. If I go somewhere else, I'll take him with me if he wants.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com", "name": "Sean Gregory",

As with their 2022 World Cup victory, the team appears to be hitting peak form at the right time.\n\n\"It's incredible what this group has achieved, what the Argentina national team continues to accomplish,\" Messi told TyC Sports after scoring his first goal of the tournament.\n\n\"It's not easy to reach another final, to compete for the championship once again. I'm experiencing this just like I did in the last Copa America and the last World Cup. These are my final battles, and I'm enjoying them to the fullest,\" said the 37-year-old.\n\nCanada, making an impressive run in their first Copa America appearance, reached the semi-finals but found Messi and his team to be an insurmountable challenge.\n\n\"The tournament took its toll on us,\" said Canada's American coach Marsch, noting that his players appeared fatigued midway through the first half.\n\n\"Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you, and that was a big part of what happened to us tonight,\" Marsch added.\n\nMarsch's team advanced by playing high-energy football from the start, but after an early chance for left-winger Jacob Shaffelburg, who shot wide after cutting in from the flank, the South Americans took control and never relinquished it.\n\nVeteran wide-man Angel Di Maria, playing in his final tournament for Argentina, was heavily involved down the right and gave an early warning of his threat when he picked out Messi, who narrowly missed the post with his shot.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 22nd minute when Rodrigo De Paul picked up the ball at the halfway line, glanced up, and lofted it over the top to Julian Alvarez. The Manchester City forward, recalled to the starting lineup ahead of Lautaro Martinez, delivered a deft first touch to evade Moises Bombito and found just enough space to drive the ball home.\n\nThe classy triangle of Di Maria, Messi, and De Paul constantly threatened Canada's back line, with Di Maria coming close to a second goal with a chip that floated over the bar.\n\nArgentina's build-up play reflected the confidence of coach Lionel Scaloni's team, a well-drilled unit that balanced organizational solidity with creativity.\n\nTwo minutes before halftime, Di Maria provided a precise pass to Messi, who created space for a shot with his right foot, but he narrowly missed Max Crepeau's right-hand post.\n\nMarsch had plenty of work to do during the interval to get his team back on level terms, but any strategy fell apart when Argentina doubled their lead just six minutes after the restart.\n\nThe excellent De Paul pulled the ball back from the byline to Enzo Fernandez, whose side-foot shot was directed home by Messi in front of the goal.\n\nFor a moment, Canada hoped Messi might have been offside, but a VAR review showed that defender Derek Cornelius had played him onside.\n\nWith a two-goal cushion, Argentina sat back to conserve energy and invited Canada to attack. It wasn't until the final minutes that Canada troubled Emiliano Martinez, with substitute Tani Oluwaseyi forcing the keeper into action after some sloppy defending.\n\nBut it was a comfortable victory for Scaloni's men, leaving them one win away from a record 16th Copa America triumph.", "source": {"uri": "nigerianobservernews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nigerianobservernews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TyC_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TyC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Shaffelburg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Shaffelburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_De_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo De Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Cornelius", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Cornelius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

La Albiceleste captured the 2021 Copa America championship, then won the 2022 World Cup.\n\n\"It is crazy what this group has done, what the Argentine national team has been doing,\" said Lionel Messi, who scored his first goal of the tournament on Tuesday. \"After this, much more importance will be given to all the finals that I played and to all the players of the old generation.\n\n\"It is a difficult Copa, very hard, with a heavy temperature. The fact that we are once again in a final is to be highlighted. I am aware that these are the last battles, and I am enjoying them to the fullest.\"\n\nNo South American team has accomplished the treble, which would be similar to Spain's run from 2008 to 2012 of two European championships sandwiching the 2010 World Cup.\n\n\"I'm not really interested about it,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said. \"The most important thing is to win, not what the statistics say that we could win three finals in a row.\".\n\nArgentina is pursuing its record 16th Copa America championship. Uruguay also has 15 titles.\n\nScaloni believes his players don't take winning for granted.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that it is very easy and straightforward, and Canada has shown today that it's not an easy task,\" he said. \"They were a very tough opponent and everyone is giving their best. But of course, we are very pleased, and I hope that everyone can enjoy this, the people and the players.\"\n\nMessi, who was hampered by a groin/thigh injury earlier in the tourney, looked reinvigorated on a hot and humid night playing on a sand-laden, natural-grass field.\n\nAfter Julian Alvarez scored in the 22nd minute, Messi made it 2-0 in the 51st minute when he used his left foot to redirect a shot by Enzo Fernandez. It wasn't a typical Messi goal, but it still counted as his 109th for his country and the 14th of his Copa America career.\n\nMessi had to wait a few minutes for a full celebration because the play was reviewed for him being offside, but Canadian defender Derek Cornelius had played him onside.\n\nEarlier, Messi brought the crowd of 80,102 to its feet in the 12th minute when he whipped a shot from the edge of the box a foot outside the right post.\n\nAlvarez, who scored the first goal of the tournament on June 20 in the 2-0 win over the Canadians, did it to them again after Argentina absorbed some early forays into its end by the lone remaining CONCACAF representative.\n\nRodrigo De Paul was near midfield when he sent a through ball forward. Alvarez, who plays for Manchester City, perfectly timed his run and with one touch pushed the ball ahead of the back line. He tracked the ball to score from the top of the box.\n\n\"It seems easy after everything we've been doing, but it's not,\" Alvarez said. \"We deserve it, we have been working very well.\"\n\nCanada's best chance to tie came two minutes into first-half stoppage time off a throw-in when Jonathan David tried to beat Emiliano Martinez at the near post but was denied.\n\nArgentina had the advantage in shots on goal (3-2) and shot attempts (11-9).\n\nCanada was a surprise semifinalist. The program was in disarray until Racine, Wis., native Jesse Marsch took over in May. He led the Canadians out of group stage in their first Copa America appearance when many predicted Mexico or the United States had the better chance to challenge for a title.\n\n\"The tournament caught up with us a little bit. ... In the end, we're still in the beginning of our process, right?\" Marsch said. \"Argentina has maybe had eight years together, seven years together with this team.\n\n\"I think in general, what I said to the team afterwards is: I know that they're very disappointed, but I'm very proud of them. You know, we've put together some incredible performances.\"\n\nThe Canadians will play the third-place match in Charlotte on Saturday against the Colombia-Uruguay loser.\n\n\"I took this job seven weeks ago,\" Marsch said. \"I couldn't have imagined that I'd be right here, right now, right? So, I'm really happy with the team and really happy with the progress.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The legendary forward reflected on cherishing the final days of his international career with his teammates while he still can.\n\nArgentina clinched a 2-0 victory against Canada, with Julian Alvarez lighting up the scoreboard early in the first half and Messi sealing the deal in the 51st minute. During his post-match interview, Messi spoke about savoring each moment in the iconic Albiceleste jersey, acknowledging that his time on the pitch won't last forever.\n\n\"I am aware that these are the last few battles, that is why I am enjoying it very much,\" said Messi. \"Let's enjoy everything that we are living and enjoying as a national team.

It's amazing that we're in a new final. It wasn't an easy cup: very tough teams, very bad pitches, the heat makes it very hard. It's worth enjoying being in a new final.\"\n\nMessi, who turned 37 last month, acknowledged that performing consistently is becoming increasingly difficult at this career stage. However, after returning to his teammates in the locker room, the Argentine hero shifted gears from reflection to motivation. Rallying his team, Messi excited the energy in the room and his teammates and declared: \"We still have one more step to go.\"\n\nArgentina will face Uruguay or Colombia in the Copa America final in Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14. Albiceleste, which has clinched the title 15 times, is tied with Uruguay for the most victories in the competition's history. A win in the upcoming final would see Argentina emerge as the top nation in tournament history, solidifying their dominance in South American football.\n\nThe career of Messi with Argentina is decorated with multiple notable achievements.

After Kendrick Lamar (5'5''), it was his turn to be humbled by Lionel Messi, who's also known for his diminutive height but global stature.\n\nIn the Copa Am\u00e9rica semi-final, Messi scored the second goal for Argentina, leading them to a 2-0 victory over Canada and securing their place in Sunday's final, where they aim to retain the title, they won in 2021.The Canadian rapper had bet $300,000 on Canada winning, with the potential to earn $2.88 million.\n\nFollowing the match, Argentina's social media team posted a celebratory image of Messi and his teammates with the caption \"Not like us,\" referencing a diss track by Lamar aimed at Drake. This track, streamed nearly 500 million times on Spotify, marked a significant moment in their public feud, akin to a 7-0 thrashing by Lamar.\n\nWhile Lamar has not commented on Argentina's tactics under coach Lionel Scaloni, Messi has been mentioned in one of his songs. In \"The Hillbillies,\" a collaboration with his cousin Keem, the lyrics include: \"Critics sayin' that I lost the plot, principles, yeah, I'd rather not, Messi, 'bout to come in hot.\"\n\nLionel Messi scored as Argentina defeated Canada 2-0 to advance to the Copa America final, where they will seek their third consecutive major title. The 15-time Copa champions showcased their best performance of the tournament at MetLife Stadium, peaking at the right moment, much like their 2022 World Cup triumph. Messi, scoring his first goal of the tournament, expressed his joy at reaching another final and competing for the championship again.\n\nCanada, participating in their first Copa America, impressed by reaching the semi-finals but found Argentina too formidable. Coach Marsch noted his team's fatigue, which became evident midway through the first half. Despite an early chance for Jacob Shaffelburg, Argentina quickly took control.\n\nRodrigo De Paul set up the first goal in the 22nd minute, with Julian Alvarez finishing expertly. The trio of Di Maria, Messi, and De Paul continually troubled Canada's defense, with Di Maria creating several opportunities. Argentina doubled their lead early in the second half when De Paul assisted Enzo Fernandez, who set up Messi for the goal. Despite Canada's late efforts, Argentina comfortably held their lead, moving one win away from a record 16th Copa America title.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

It is not easy to be in a final again, to compete again to be champions,\" Messi told TyC Sports.\n\n\"I'm living it as I have been living everything lately: enjoying it very much and being aware, as it happens to Fideo (Di Maria) and Ota (Otamendi), that these are the last battles.\"\n\nArgentina have won a joint-record 15 Copa titles and reached the final six times in the past eight editions but Canada caused them real problems in the opening 20 minutes, Jacob Shaffelburg twice shooting wide from promising positions.\n\nAfter soaking up the early pressure, though, Argentina went ahead when Rodrigo De Paul played through Alvarez, who ghosted in between two defenders to score with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo Ties with Iran's Ali Daei as the All-Time Top Scorer in International Soccer\n\nCanada nearly snatched an equaliser against the run of play in first-half stoppage time as Jonathan David sneaked in ahead of his marker to get on the end of a long throw, but his close-range shot was hit straight at goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.\n\nMessi had struggled with a muscle injury earlier in the tournament but appeared revitalised on a hot and humid evening at the MetLife Stadium.\n\nHe scored Argentina's second in the 51st minute, sticking out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.\n\nThe goal moved Messi to joint fifth in the all-time Copa America scoring charts, level with Peru's Paolo Guerrero and Chile's Eduardo Vargas, on 14.\n\nHis 109th goal for Argentina also saw him surpass Iran's Ali Daei to take sole possession of second place on the all-time international scoring charts. Messi trails only Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 130 goals for Portugal.\n\nDespite their two-goal cushion, Argentina had a nervy finish to the match as Canada substitute Tani Oluwaseyi tested Martinez with a crisp shot in the 89th minute before directing a glancing header wide a minute later.\n\nFor Canada, the defeat ends a remarkable run in which they defied expectations and performed better than their higher-ranked CONCACAF rivals Mexico and the United States, their fellow co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\"They're the best team in the world, but at the same time we had our chances in the beginning of the game,\" midfielder Stephen Eustaquio told Canadian broadcaster TSN.\n\n\"If we scored one of our chances, the story of the game would probably have been different.

The will play the final of the tournament on July 14 at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami against the winner of the Colombia-Uruguay match.\n\nCanada will play on July 13 at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte against the loser of the aforementioned match.\n\nCanada and Argentina delivered a first half that began chaotically and was equally entertaining: without a midfield, and without the tension that defining matches usually have.\n\nThe first blow finally came in the 23rd minute with a goal from Alvarez, who received a good through ball from Rodrigo De Paul, shook off the marking and scored to break the tie.\n\nArgentina neutralised the Canadian attacks and created good scoring opportunities. At the end of the first half, Messi made a move in the area, and his shot went just past the goalkeeper's post.\n\nThe last chance of the first half was for Jonathan David, with Canada's first shot on goal in the match. At halftime, Argentina was ahead 1-0.\n\nAt the start of the second half, Messi cut in from the right as he used to do in his early days. Inside the box, he passed to Rodrigo de Paul, and after a rebound, Enzo Fernandez shot at the goal. Messi himself deflected it, and after a VAR review, it was confirmed as 2-0 for Argentina, marking Messi's first goal in this edition and his 14th in his Copa America career.\n\nWith that comfortable lead, Argentina slowed the game down and made substitutions to refresh the team. Di Maria also came off, in one of his last matches for the national team.\n\nWith two minutes remaining, Canada pressed Argentina's defense well and had their best chance, but Emilano Martinez managed to stop Tani Oluwaseyi's shot and Argentina secured a 2-0 win, secured their fifth consecutive podium finish in the world's oldest national team tournament: 2015 (final), 2016 (final), 2019 (third place), 2021 (champions).", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_De_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo De Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 22, "textEnd": 29}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 356, "textEnd": 363}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 469, "textEnd": 476}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It's super difficult to be in a final, especially coming in the way we did with previous success and triumph. It's double as hard.\n\n\"The ones on the inside know how difficult it is to reach this point.

Messi and Co. dispatched Canada in the semifinal by the same scoreline as it did in group play at 2-0 to put the team in the final.\n\nNow, the team prepares to face either Uruguay or Colombia in what could be the final game for Di Maria and Messi.\n\n\"You know how I think, we wait and see how he plays,\" Scaloni said of Di Maria. \"We won't retire him early before the game, then the tears will start and everyone, his family, will get melancholic. We'll see later if we convince him or not convince him, but for now we let him play.\n\n\"It's the same case for Messi. We leave them calm from our part, we won't be the ones to close the door on them. He can be with us until he wants, and even after he retires he can join me if I'm still coach.

I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup...These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum,\" said the 37-year-old.\n\nCanada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.\n\n\"I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit,\" said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.\n\n\"Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight,\" he added.\n\nMarsch's side had progressed by hitting teams with high-energy football straight out of the gate but after an early opening for left-winger Jacob Shaffelburg, who fired wide after cutting in from the flank, the South Americans took control and never gave it up.\n\nAngel Di Maria, the veteran wide-man playing in his final tournament for his country, was seeing plenty of the ball down the right and he offered an early warning of his threat when he picked out Messi with a ball inside which the forward flashed just wife of the post.\n\nBut it was Rodrigo De Paul who was to create the breakthrough in the 22nd minute, picking the ball up on the half-way line, taking a quick glance up and then lofting the ball over the top to Julian Alvarez.\n\nThe Manchester City forward, recalled to the starting line-up ahead of Lautaro Martinez, delivered a deft first touch that took him away from Moises Bombito and gave him just enough room to drive the ball home.\n\nMore from this section DraftKings fined $100,000 by New Jersey gambling regulators over inaccurate data Flight Attendants Reveal Their Tips for Smart Packing and Flying 'I just want to win now': Raptors re-sign Barnes, Quickley - Classy triangle -\n\nThe classy triangle of Di Maria, Messi and De Paul, was a constant source of danger for Canada's back line and the former threatened a second with a chip from the right which floated over the bar.\n\nThe assuredness of Argentina's build-up play reflects the confidence of coach Lionel Scaloni's team, a well-drilled unit but one that never allows their organisational solidity dominate over their creativity.\n\nTwo minutes before the break, former Real Madrid winger Di Maria provided a slide-rule pass to Messi, who worked himself space for a shot on his right-foot, but he was narrowly wide of Max Crepeau's right-hand post.\n\nCanada's American coach Marsch had plenty of work to do at the interval if he was to find a way of getting his team back on level terms and any strategy went out of the window when the world champions doubled their lead, just six minutes after the restart.\n\nThe excellent De Paul pulled the ball back from the byline to Enzo Fernandez and his side-foot shot was directed home by Messi in front of goal.\n\nFor a moment Canada had hope that Messi may have been offside but the VAR review showed that defender Derek Cornelius had played him onside.\n\nThe two-goal cushion established, Argentina were content to sit back and preserve their energy and invite the Canadians to take them on.\n\nIt was not until the final minutes though that Canada were able to trouble Emiliano Martinez with substitute Tani Oluwaseyi forcing the keeper into action after some sloppy defending.\n\nBut it was a comfortable victory for Scaloni's men and one which leaves them one win away from a record 16th Copa America triumph.\n\nsev/rcw", "source": {"uri":

Let's enjoy everything that we are living and enjoying as a national team. It is not easy to get to another final,\" Messi told the press after the game. \"We have to take advantage because it's not something easy These are some of my last battles and I have to enjoy.\"\n\nArgentina will face either Uruguay or Colombia in the 2024 Copa America final, which takes place on Saturday at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri":

I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup...These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum,\" said the 37-year-old.\n\nCanada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.\n\n\"I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit,\" said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.\n\n\"Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight,\" he added.\n\nMarsch's side had progressed by hitting teams with high-energy football straight out of the gate but after an early opening for left-winger Jacob Shaffelburg, who fired wide after cutting in from the flank, the South Americans took control and never gave it up.\n\nAngel Di Maria, the veteran wide-man playing in his final tournament for his country, was seeing plenty of the ball down the right and he offered an early warning of his threat when he picked out Messi with a ball inside which the forward flashed just wide of the post.\n\nBut it was Rodrigo De Paul who was to create the breakthrough in the 22nd minute, picking the ball up on the halfway line, taking a quick glance up and then lofting the ball over the top to Julian Alvarez.\n\nThe Manchester City forward recalled to the starting line-up ahead of Lautaro Martinez, delivered a deft first touch that took him away from Moises Bombito and gave him just enough room to drive the ball home.\n\n- Classy triangle -\n\nThe classy triangle of Di Maria, Messi and De Paul, was a constant source of danger for Canada's back line and the former threatened a second with a chip from the right which floated over the bar.\n\nThe assuredness of Argentina's build-up play reflects the confidence of coach Lionel Scaloni's team, a well-drilled unit but one that never allows their organisational solidity to dominate over their creativity.\n\nTwo minutes before the break, former Real Madrid winger Di Maria provided a slide-rule pass to Messi, who worked himself space for a shot on his right foot, but he was narrowly wide of Max Crepeau's right-hand post.\n\nCanada's American coach Marsch had plenty of work to do at the interval if he was to find a way of getting his team back on level terms and any strategy went out of the window when the world champions doubled their lead, just six minutes after the restart.\n\nThe excellent De Paul pulled the ball back from the byline to Enzo Fernandez and his side-foot shot was directed home by Messi in front of goal.\n\nFor a moment Canada had hope that Messi may have been offside but the VAR review showed that defender Derek Cornelius had played him onside.\n\nWith the two-goal cushion established, Argentina were content to sit back and preserve their energy and invite the Canadians to take them on.\n\nIt was not until the final minutes though that Canada were able to trouble Emiliano Martinez with substitute Tani Oluwaseyi forcing the keeper into action after some sloppy defending.\n\nBut it was a comfortable victory for Scaloni's men and one which leaves them one win away from a record 16th Copa America triumph.", "source": {"uri": "tv360nigeria.com", "dataType":

We don't want to feel melancholy,\" Scaloni said. \"We have to let him play and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us.\"\n\nSouth American World Cup qualifying resumes in September, with each national team scheduled to play 12 more matches. The 2026 World Cup final will be at MetLife, that July 19.\n\n\"We will never be the ones to close the door,\" Scaloni said. \"He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great. And if he wants to come with me to somewhere else, I will take him everywhere so he can decide whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nAP Copa America coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/copa-america\n\nArgentina's Lionel Messi, right, high-fives Rodrigo De Paul during a Copa America semifinal soccer match against Canada in East Rutherford, N.J., Tuesday, July 9, 2024.

I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup...These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum,\" said the 37-year-old.\n\nCanada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.\n\n\"I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit,\" said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.\n\n\"Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight,\" he added.\n\nMarsch's side had progressed by hitting teams with high-energy football straight out of the gate but after an early opening for left-winger Jacob Shaffelburg, who fired wide after cutting in from the flank, the South Americans took control and never gave it up.\n\nAngel Di Maria, the veteran wide-man playing in his final tournament for his country, was seeing plenty of the ball down the right and he offered an early warning of his threat when he picked out Messi with a ball inside which the forward flashed just wife of the post.\n\nBut it was Rodrigo De Paul who was to create the breakthrough in the 22nd minute, picking the ball up on the half-way line, taking a quick glance up and then lofting the ball over the top to Julian Alvarez.\n\nThe Manchester City forward, recalled to the starting line-up ahead of Lautaro Martinez, delivered a deft first touch that took him away from Moises Bombito and gave him just enough room to drive the ball home.\n\n- Classy triangle -\n\nThe classy triangle of Di Maria, Messi and De Paul, was a constant source of danger for Canada's back line and the former threatened a second with a chip from the right which floated over the bar.\n\nThe assuredness of Argentina's build-up play reflects the confidence of coach Lionel Scaloni's team, a well-drilled unit but one that never allows their organisational solidity dominate over their creativity.\n\nTwo minutes before the break, former Real Madrid winger Di Maria provided a slide-rule pass to Messi, who worked himself space for a shot on his right-foot, but he was narrowly wide of Max Crepeau's right-hand post.\n\nCanada's American coach Marsch had plenty of work to do at the interval if he was to find a way of getting his team back on level terms and any strategy went out of the window when the world champions doubled their lead, just six minutes after the restart.\n\nThe excellent De Paul pulled the ball back from the byline to Enzo Fernandez and his side-foot shot was directed home by Messi in front of goal.\n\nFor a moment Canada had hope that Messi may have been offside but the VAR review showed that defender Derek Cornelius had played him onside.\n\nThe two-goal cushion established, Argentina were content to sit back and preserve their energy and invite the Canadians to take them on.\n\nIt was not until the final minutes though that Canada were able to trouble Emiliano Martinez with substitute Tani Oluwaseyi forcing the keeper into action after some sloppy defending.\n\nBut it was a comfortable victory for Scaloni's men and one which leaves them one win away from a record 16th Copa America triumph.\n\nsev/rcw\n\nMore from this section\n\nKickstarter

We don't want to retire him earlier than needed,\" Scaloni said.\n\n\"We don't want to feel melancholy. We have to let him play, and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us. But so far, he's here, and he has to be allowed to enjoy this moment.\n\n\"For Leo (Messi), it's similar to Angel. We have to let him be and we will never be the ones to close the door. He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great.\"\n\nIn Sunday's final, Argentina could face either Uruguay, which beat it in a World Cup qualifier in November, or Colombia, which is on a 27-match unbeaten run under coach Nestor Lorenzo.\n\n\"These two potential opponents are top-notch national teams, but it would be reckless to say that I prefer one or the other,\" Scaloni said.\n\n\"One of them already beat us. It was a very tough match. We have not played against Colombia with this coach, but we know it could be very difficult as well.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarNo bed of roses - Scaloni hails Argentina's grit after making Copa America 2024 final ReutersWimbledon 2024: Paolini pummels Navarro to book semifinal with Vekic ReutersEuro 2024: Koeman shrugs off Dutch travel disruption, says team is ready for semifinal ReutersEuro 2024: Southgate defends reluctance to use his bench ReutersCopa America 2024: Messi says he is enjoying \"last battles\" for Argentina AFPREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ss-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/tqbzx1/article68387809.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-07-10T015042Z_1485393740_UP1EK7A054GIT_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-COPA-ARG-CAN-REPORT.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Lionel Messi plans to keep playing for Argentina beyond Sunday's Copa America final.\n\n\"As I've said before, I intend to continue,\" he said Tuesday night after Argentina's 2-0 win over Canada. \"I intend to keep living day by day without thinking about what will come in the future or whether I'll continue or not. It's something I just live each day. I'm 37 years and only God knows when the end will be.\"\n\nMessi scored his 109th international goal, his first in this year's tournament. It was his 14th in Copa America play, three shy of the record.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner spoke outside the locker room at MetLife Stadium, where he announced his retirement after missing a penalty kick in the shootout loss to Chile in the 2016 Copa America final. He reversed his decision seven weeks later and has scored 54 goals in 73 international appearances since, raising his matches for Argentina to 186 as he helped win the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup.\n\nTeammate \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda does intend to retire after Sunday's game against Uruguay or Colombia at Miami Gardens, Florida. The 36-year-old Di Mar\u00eda made his international debut in 2008 and has 31 goals in 144 appearances,\n\n\"It's my last battle. There's nothing left to say that I haven't said a lot of times before,\" Di Mar\u00eda explained. \"It's my last game. I have to say thank you to all Argentineans and to this generation that has allowed me to lift so many trophies.\"\n\nDi Mar\u00eda joined with Messi to lead Argentina to it's third World Cup and 15th Copa America title.\n\n\"We've enjoyed him so much,\" Messi said. \"He's always given his all and the best of himself and that he will retire in a final is something he simply deserves.\"\n\nArgentina coach Lionel Scaloni held out hope Di Mar\u00eda will reverse his decision.\n\n\"We don't want to start crying right now. We don't want to feel melancholy,\" Scaloni said. \"We have to let him play and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us.\"\n\nSouth American World Cup qualifying resumes in September, with each national team scheduled to play 12 more matches. The 2026 World Cup final will be at MetLife, that July 19.\n\n\"We will never be the ones to close the door,\" Scaloni said. \"He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great. And if he wants to come with me to somewhere else, I will take him everywhere so he can decide whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

After the match, he tweeted a photo of him and Messi from 2007 that recently went viral.\n\nMessi scored his first career goal at Copa Am\u00e9rica on July 9, 2007; Yamal was born four days later.\n\nMessi's goal against Canada marked his 14th in 38 career Copa Am\u00e9rica appearances. In tournaments that he has scored in, though, this is the longest it has taken him to nab that first goal. For recent comparison's sake, Messi scored seven at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, including twice in the final.\n\nIt's no secret that the 37-year-old superstar hasn't been 100% healthy. He struggled with a hamstring injury earlier in the year that forced him to miss multiple matches for Inter Miami. And during Copa Am\u00e9rica, he's been hampered by a right groin/adductor injury that kept him on the bench for Argentina's third group stage match -- a 2-0 win over Peru.\n\nHe played the full 90 minutes of Argentina's quarterfinal against Ecuador, but was impressively contained for the most part and had limited touches. That match turned into a penalty shootout and Messi, taking the first kick, uncharacteristically missed from the spot after an attempted Panenka hit the crossbar.\n\nThere were other lost opportunities before that, like in the opening match against Canada and in the second one vs. Chile. Against La Roja, he attempted an olimpico -- or scoring directly from a corner kick, which is something he'd never done -- but it didn't work out.\n\nOf course, he's contributed to goals and created chances for his teammates. And even when Messi isn't manufacturing all the magic, Argentina has proven it can win -- against Canada, Julian Alvarez's smooth goal in the 22nd minute might have been enough.\n\n\"We have Leo, but we know that the entire team is there and if they are not performing well all together, we're going to suffer,\" coach Lionel Scaloni said via an interpreter. \"And we do everything as a team. There's a great level of togetherness and unity. They're very strong together.\"\n\nAnd that's an important exercise for this squad, because one day, it will have to learn how to compete without Messi on a permanent basis.\n\nThough Scaloni will tell you that there's no rush on his end.\n\n\"We have to let him be and we will never be the ones to close the door [on his national team career],\" Scaloni said. \"He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire, but still come and hang around, that would be great.\"\n\nMessi's supporters would love that. The sellout crowd -- many of whom were wearing his No. 10 jersey -- were grateful to witness his 109th international goal. They were there early, setting up tailgates on the stadium grounds more than four hours before kickoff. When the jumbotron showed Messi getting off the team bus upon arrival, those who were already inside MetLife gave him a standing ovation. When Messi took a corner kick in the 35th minute, fans in the northeast corner contorted their bodies in order to get the best angle while holding up their smartphones to snap a once-in-a-lifetime photo of their favorite player. When he missed a quality shot in the 44th minute, the more than 80,000 fans in attendance collectively sighed.\n\nNow, Argentina has the chance to become the first team since Spain (which won the 2008 Euros, 2010 World Cup and 2012 Euros) to win three straight major championships (2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica, 2022 World Cup, and now, maybe, the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica).\n\nScaloni said he's not interested in those kinds of statistics because \"the most important thing is to win.\" And while it's been clear this summer that Messi doesn't always have to score for Argentina to do that, everyone prefers it when he does.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type":

It was also Messi's 109th international goal, passing Ali Daei for second-most men's international goals of all time.\n\nCanada, in quintessential Jesse Marsch fashion, started with a lot of energy as their high press aimed to make Argentina just as uncomfortable as the weather at MetLife stadium. Nashville SC's Jacob Shaffelburg tested Gonzalo Montiel's right side early in the game, but in the end, it came to nothing.\n\nAs the first half developed, that Canadian press and aggression deflated, and Argentina started to take more control as Messi attempted a low, left-footed shot in the 12th minute. Canada was not bowing down, and it looked to capitalize on loose possession, but it still couldn't find the right pass to fully threaten Argentina keeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez\n\nAnd when you play Argentina, you have to take any chance you get, because if you don't, Lionel Scaloni's side will eventually make you pay.\n\nThey are, after all, FIFA's best-ranked team and World Cup and Copa Am\u00e9rica defending champions for a reason.\n\nAnd in the 22nd minute, La Albiceleste took the lead following a great through ball from Rodrigo De Paul that found \u00c0lvarez. It was \u00c0lvarez's second goal in the tournament and again, just like in the opening game during the group stages, he initiated the scoring against Canada\n\nThe evaporation of Canada's in-your-face approach allowed Argentina to become the complete protagonists. As for Messi's first half? He was relatively quiet in terms of threat, but his movement in the midfield and ability to spread the ball around was present. In the 44th minute, a beautiful play between \u00c1ngel D\u00ed Mar\u00eda, \u00c0lvarez and Messi nearly ended with the Inter Miami CF star scoring a goal, but Messi placed it just wide of Maxime Cr\u00e9peau's net.\n\nBy the end of the first half, Argentina had more than 60% possession and eight attempts. Aside from an effort after a throw-in, which needed Mart\u00ednez to deny Alphonso Davies, the defending Copa Am\u00e9rica champions were in full control.\n\nIn the end, the game was done and dusted after the first goal, and Argentina made it to yet another Copa Am\u00e9rica final. Next up for them is a return to Hard Rock Stadium and their home away from home of Miami. They await the winner of Wednesday's tasty fixture between Colombia and Uruguay.", "source": {"uri": "nairaland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairaland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Daei", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ali Daei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Shaffelburg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Shaffelburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Cr\u00e9peau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxime Cr\u00e9peau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_De_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo De Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josef Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

I have to say thank you to all Argentineans and to this generation that has allowed me to lift so many trophies.\"\n\nDi Mar\u00efa joined with Messi to lead Argentina to it's third World Cup and 15th Copa America title.\n\n\"We've enjoyed him so much,\" Messi said. \"He's always given his all and the best of himself and that he will retire in a final is something he simply deserves.\"\n\nArgentina coach Lionel Scaloni held out hope Di Mar\u00efa will reverse his decision.\n\n\"We don't want to start crying right now. We don't want to feel melancholy,\" Scaloni said. \"We have to let him play and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us.\"\n\nSouth American World Cup qualifying resumes in September, with each national team scheduled to play 12 more matches. The 2026 World Cup final will be at MetLife, that July 19.\n\n\"We will never be the ones to close the door,\" Scaloni said. \"He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great. And if he wants to come with me to somewhere else, I will take him everywhere so he can decide whatever he wants to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica_Centenario", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Gardens,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/0ee960b7c8bf606c72ac20e1051d212c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 2050, "textEnd": 2057}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

However, Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni wants European teams in the competition to prove that the tournament is more difficult than it looks.\n\nArgentina currently holds the top position globally and are on the brink of securing a third trophy from their last three major tournaments. Since taking over as head coach in 2018, Scaloni has rejuvenated the football team, bringing major success back to the country.\n\nHe guided Argentina to their first Copa America title since 1993 in 2021. The following year, he achieved another milestone by leading the team to win the World Cup, a feat that had eluded Argentina since 1986.\n\nSome say he is the best thing that has happened to captain Lionel Messi, after many thought he would go trophyless with his home nation despite such an illustrious career.\n\nOn Sunday, Messi could be lifting his third trophy with Argentina in just three years and critics have responded to this by claiming the competition isn't good enough in Copa America compared to the Euros.\n\nAn angry Scaloni replied: 'I don't think it's more difficult from one competition to another. 'There are some important teams that have advanced to the semi-finals of the Euros, teams that we faced in the World Cup and it went well for us. But that doesn't mean that we could go to the European Championship and win it.'\n\n'Or maybe yes (we could win it). I think the level is very even. 'I would like a European team to one day be invited to a Copa America to see what it is like to play in a Copa America and the opposite, as well.\n\n'But that would be a World Cup, right? So, in the end the difficulty is the same. I don't think there's much difference, really. But these are just opinions.'\n\nIt's unclear yet who Argentina will face in the final as Uruguay v Columbia kicks off at 8pm EST this Wednesday evening. The final will be played at 8pm EST on Sunday 14th July at the Hard Rock stadium.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_bellamy@sportslens.com", "name": "Jack Bellamy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI-23673695-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1952, "textEnd": 1961}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Me, Fide [Angel Di Mar\u00eda], Ota [Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi], and that Argentina can play another final is amazing.\n\n\"To be honest it has been a difficult tournament, the level has been as equal as ever, very bad field, high temperatures that make it hard to play, very tough rivals.

Messi is obviously at the center of that, though it remains unclear if he will call it quits on his international career following the Copa.\n\n\"We leave them calm from our part, we won't be the ones to close the door on them,\" manager Lionel Scaloni said of the uncertain international futures of Messi and Di Mar\u00eda. \"[Messi] can be with us until he wants, and even after he retires he can join me if I'm still coach.

It is not easy to get to another final.\n\n\"We have to take advantage because it's not something easy These are some of my last battles and I have to enjoy.\"\n\nExpanding into further detail, Messi said, \"It's crazy what this group has been doing, what the Argentine National Team has been doing, because a lot of importance is being given to the finals that I and all of the old team played in.\n\n\"It's amazing that we're in a new final. It wasn't an easy cup: very tough teams, very bad pitches, the heat makes it very hard. It's worth enjoying being in a new final.\"\n\nManager Lionel Scaloni expressed excitement over reaching this point of the competition, before warning of the difficulties that lie ahead for Argentina.\n\n\"It's something to be proud of and grateful to the players for,\" Scaloni said. \"Yesterday, a colleague asked me if we normalize this, but the question was good and I wasn't clear.\n\n\"It's super difficult to be in a final, especially coming in the way we did with previous success and triumph.

Of all the soccer records, the record for most international goals scored by a player is among the most sought-after. Not only does this accomplishment demonstrate extraordinary skill, but it also demonstrates great consistency and durability. Currently, the record is held by Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese forward famous for his incredible commitment to the sport and his ability to score goals.\n\nBut there has been a shift in the rankings after three years, however, and Ronaldo is under more pressure to maintain his record. This is especially true because Lionel Messi, the Argentine legend, continues to make history.\n\nIn Argentina's 2-0 victory over Canada in the Copa America semifinal, Messi's goal not only propelled his team to the final but also marked a significant personal achievement. By scoring his 109th international goal, Messi surpassed Iran's Ali Daei to become the second-highest international goalscorer in history. He is now only behind his arch-rival, who has 130 goals.\n\nMessi's historic goal came at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. During the match, Canada struggled to clear a shot from Enzo Fernandez, and Messi capitalized by redirecting the ball into the net. Initially contested by the Canadian players for a potential offside, the VAR review confirmed that Messi was onside, thanks to Canada's Cornelius, and the goal stood. This goal was Messi's first in the 2024 Copa America and his 14th in the tournament overall.\n\nThe 37-year-old's leadership on the pitch has been crucial for Argentina, especially after missing the previous match against Ecuador. His return to action against Canada not only lifted the team's performance but also added to his illustrious career milestones.\n\nTo add to his feat, his international career has been nothing short of extraordinary. Since reversing his retirement decision in 2016, Messi has scored 54 goals in 73 international appearances, helping Argentina win both the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup. His ability to consistently perform at the highest level, even at 37, is a testament to his dedication and talent.\n\nArgentina will face either Uruguay or Colombia in the Copa America final. Messi's focus remains on leading his team to another title, further cementing Argentina's status as a powerhouse in international soccer. After the Copa America, the superstar will return to MLS action with Inter Miami, continuing his storied career.\n\nAs Messi continues to break records, the soccer world watches closely. The rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo, two of the greatest players in history, remains a captivating storyline. The 39-year-old, who recently played in Euro 2024, will be looking to add to his goal tally with Portugal when the next tournament comes around; as he prepares for the new Saudi Pro League season with Al-Nassr.\n\nWhile Messi and Ronaldo have set incredibly high standards, the next generation of players is already emerging. Players like Kylian Mbappe of France, Vinicius of Brazil, and Erling Haaland of Norway have the potential to challenge these records in the future. However, surpassing the Portuguese's record will require exceptional talent, consistency, and longevity.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Daei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Daei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nassr_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al-Nassr FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240710_WST_515561_most-international-goals.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

final where they will look for a third straight major title.\n\nThe defending Copa champions will face the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Uruguay and Colombia in what will be a highly anticipated final in Miami on Sunday.\n\nThe 15-times Copa champions produced their best display of the tournament in front of a capacity crowd at the 82,500 MetLife Stadium and as in their 2022 World Cup triumph they look to be peaking at the perfect moment.\n\nCanada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.\n\nJesse Marsch's side had progressed by hitting teams with high-energy football straight out of the gate but after an early opening for left-winger Jacob Shaffelburg, who fired wide after cutting in from the flank, the South Americans took control and never gave it up.\n\nAngel Di Maria, the veteran wide-man playing in his final tournament for his country, was seeing plenty of the ball down the right and he offered an early warning of his threat when he picked out Messi with a ball inside which the forward flashed just wife of the post.\n\nBut it was Rodrigo De Paul who was to create the breakthrough in the 22nd minute, picking the ball up on the half-way line, taking a quick glance up and then lofting the ball over the top to Julian Alvarez.\n\nThe Manchester City forward, recalled to the starting line-up ahead of Lautaro Martinez, delivered a deft first touch that took him away from Moises Bombito and gave him just enough room to drive the ball home.\n\nClassy triangle\n\nThe classy triangle of Di Maria, Messi and De Paul, was a constant source of danger for Canada's back line and the former threatened a second with a chip from the right which floated over the bar.\n\nThe assuredness of Argentina's build-up play reflects the confidence of coach Lionel Scaloni's team, a well-drilled unit but one that never allows their organisational solidity dominate over their creativity.\n\nTwo minutes before the break, former Real Madrid winger Di Maria provided a slide-rule pass to Messi, who worked himself space for a shot on his right-foot, but he was narrowly wide of Max Crepeau's right-hand post.\n\nCanada's American coach Marsch had plenty of work to do at the interval if he was to find a way of getting his team back on level terms and any strategy went out of the window when the world champions doubled their lead, just six minutes after the restart.\n\nThe excellent De Paul pulled the ball back from the byline to Enzo Fernandez and his side-foot shot was directed home by Messi in front of goal.\n\nFor a moment Canada had hope that Messi may have been offside but the VAR review showed that defender Derek Cornelius had played him onside.\n\nThe two-goal cushion established, Argentina were content to sit back and preserve their energy and invite the Canadians to take them on.\n\nIt was not until the final minutes though that Canada were able to trouble Emiliano Martinez with substitute Tani Oluwaseyi forcing the keeper into action after some sloppy defending.\n\nBut it was a comfortable victory for Scaloni's men and one which leaves them one win away from a record 16th Copa America triumph.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"},

We'll see later if we convince him or not convince him, but for now we let him play.\n\n\"It's the same case for Messi. We leave them calm from our part, we won't be the ones to close the door on them. He can be with us as long as he wants, and even after he retires he can join me if I'm still coach. And if not I'll take him where I go. He would be a great help.\"\n\nMessi has offered little indication as to when he might retire, but did say after the game: \"We enjoy what we are living as a squad, as a group. It is not easy that we are in a final again and we are about to compete again with the possibility of being champions.\n\n\"A lot of importance is given to the previous finals that me and the 'old guard' have played. These are the last battles we will have with Di Maria and [Nicolas] Otamendi. Surely this is my last Copa.\"\n\nArgentina are the defending Copa champions and backed up their continental success by winning the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\n\nIt's a remarkable run of success that even the understated Scaloni says should be recognised.\n\n\"It's something to be proud of and grateful to the players for,\" Scaloni said. \"Yesterday, a [media] colleague asked me if we normalise this, but the question was good and I wasn't clear.\n\n\"It's super difficult to be in a final, especially coming in the way we did with previous success and triumph. It's twice as hard.\n\n\"The ones on the inside know how difficult it is to reach this point.

It was his 14th in Copa Am\u00e9rica play, three shy of the record.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner spoke outside the locker room at MetLife Stadium, where he announced his retirement after missing a penalty kick in the shootout loss to Chile in the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica final.\n\nHe reversed his decision seven weeks later and has scored 54 goals in 73 international appearances since, raising his matches for Argentina to 186 as he helped win the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and 2022 World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_U-20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA U-20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica_Centenario", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2024%2F0709%2Fdm_240709_Messi_Canada_analysis%2Fdm_240709_Messi_Canada_analysis.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 727}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa Am\u00e9rica, in the last World Cup... these are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum,\" said the 37-year-old.\n\nCanada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.\n\n\"I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit,\" said Canada's US coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.\n\n\"Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight,\" he added.\n\nMarsch's side had progressed by hitting teams with high-energy football straight out of the gate but after an early opening for left-winger Jacob Shaffelburg, who fired wide after cutting in from the flank, the Albiceleste took control and never gave it up.\n\n\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, the veteran wide-man playing in his final tournament for his country, was seeing plenty of the ball down the right and he offered an early warning of his threat when he picked out Messi with a ball inside which the forward flashed just wife of the post.\n\nBut it was Rodrigo De Paul who was to create the breakthrough in the 22nd minute, picking the ball up on the half-way line, taking a quick glance up and then lofting the ball over the top to Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez.\n\nThe Manchester City forward, recalled to the starting line-up ahead of Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, delivered a deft first touch that took him away from Moises Bombito and gave him just enough room to drive the ball home.\n\nThe classy triangle of Di Mar\u00eda, Messi and De Paul, was a constant source of danger for Canada's back line and the former threatened a second with a chip from the right which floated over the bar.\n\nThe assuredness of Argentina's build-up play reflects the confidence of coach Lionel Scaloni's team, a well-drilled unit but one that never allows their organisational solidity dominate over their creativity.\n\nTwo minutes before the break, former Real Madrid winger Di Mar\u00eda provided a slide-rule pass to Messi, who worked himself space for a shot on his right-foot, but he was narrowly wide of Max Crepeau's right-hand post.\n\nCanada's US coach Marsch had plenty of work to do at the interval if he was to find a way of getting his team back on level terms and any strategy went out of the window when the world champions doubled their lead, just six minutes after the restart.\n\nThe excellent De Paul pulled the ball back from the byline to Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez and his side-foot shot was directed home by Messi in front of goal.\n\nFor a moment Canada had hope that Messi may have been offside but the VAR review showed that defender Derek Cornelius had played him onside.\n\nThe two-goal cushion established, Argentina were content to sit back and preserve their energy and invite the Canadians to take them on.\n\nIt was not until the final minutes though that Canada were able to trouble Emiliano Mart\u00ednez with substitute Tani Oluwaseyi forcing the keeper into action after some sloppy defending.\n\nBut it was a comfortable victory for Scaloni's men and one which leaves them one win away from a record 16th Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph.", "source": {"uri": "batimes.com.ar",

It is tough because we know how hard it is to get there,\" Scaloni said afterwards..\n\n\"The bar has been set very high.

We don't want to retire him earlier than needed,\" Scaloni said.\n\n\"We don't want to feel melancholy. We have to let him play, and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us. But so far, he's here, and he has to be allowed to enjoy this moment.\n\n\"For Leo (Messi), it's similar to Angel. We have to let him be and we will never be the ones to close the door. He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be.

They saw a gutsy performance from Canada, albeit one lacking in clinical finishing, and pure class from Argentina, whose passing and buildup were straight out of a video game at times.\n\nThe Canadians also fell 2-0 to Argentina when they met in the June 20th tournament opener in Atlanta. Argentina thumped Canada 5-0 in their only other meeting, in May 2010 in Buenos Aires in the Argentines' final warm-up before the FIFA World Cup in South Africa.\n\nMessi and the Argentines will play either No. 12 Colombia or No. 14 Uruguay, who meet Wednesday in Charlotte, N.C., in Sunday's championship game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.\n\n\"It's insane what this team has done, what the Argentina national team is doing,\" Messi said. \"For those who remain from the old guard, it's beyond impressive that the national team is in another final.\"\n\nCanada heads to Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte for Saturday's third-place game.\n\n\"If we want to be a nation that gains ranking spots and be ready for '26, we got to dig deeper than that tonight even though we give a good effort,\" said Canadian goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau. \"Even though they are the world champions, everybody on the field feels like we could have done better.\n\n\" ... We need to regroup and go for third place.\"\n\nArgentina showed its quality, content to stroke the ball around and then change gears in an instant when it saw an opening in Canada's defence.\n\nAnd despite a positive start, Canada fell behind in the 22nd minute on Argentina's first shot on target. The Canadian defence was carved open by a long pass from Rodrigo De Paul that Alvarez controlled with a fine first touch before outmuscling Moise Bombito and slipping a shot through Crepeau's legs.\n\nCoach Jesse Marsch and the Canadian bench were irate, believing a foul by Argentina's Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico -- who steamrollered Richie Laryea as he tried to corral Crepeau's goal kick, allowing the South Americans to win possession -- had been missed before the goal. Eight touches later the ball was in the Canada net.\n\nBut Chilean referee Piero Maza was letting the teams play, much to Marsch's displeasure. The Canada coach eventually received a caution in the 77th minute for voicing his displeasure with the officiating.\n\nMessi made it 2-0 in the 51st minute with a slight redirect of an Enzo Fernandez shot through traffic after Canada failed to clear the ball. Canada had eight defenders in front of Crepeau in its penalty box but could not snuff out the threat.\n\nThe goal survived a video review check for offside with Messi getting the green light for his first goal of the tournament and his 14th in career Copa America play.\n\nCanada captain Alphonso Davies had to leave in the 71st minute after being injured in a hard challenge by Gonzalo Montiel that went unpunished.\n\nThere was some bad blood late in the game, with Argentina upset at Canadian midfielder Ismael Kone petulantly kicking the ball into one of their fallen players.\n\nMetLife Stadium's temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles.\n\n\"It's has been a very difficult Copa America, very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat,\" Messi said.\n\nThe Canadian men were looking to reach their first tournament final since the 2000 Gold Cup when they upset Colombia to win the CONCACAF crown.\n\nCanada, the last survivor of the six CONCACAF guest teams, is making its Copa debut. The Canadian men beat No. 99 Trinidad and Tobago 2-1 in a March playoff to make the 16-country field -- as the 11th-ranked team at the tournament.\n\nIt has been an eventful competition for the Canadian side under Marsch, the 50-year-old American who has infused his new team with youth and confidence as well as a new skipper in Davies.\n\n\"The tournament caught up with us a little bit,\" said Marsch after the semifinal setback. \"There's been heat, there's been travel, there's been a lot of challenges. ... We're still at the beginnings of our process, right?\n\n\"Argentina's maybe had eight years together, seven years together with this team, and so we need to develop more players that can contribute so that we can also rotate in tournament play, because eventually the physicality and the fatigue can catch up with you.\"\n\nCrepeau has established himself as Canada's No. 1 goalkeeper. Bombito and Derek Cornelius have become the heart of the defence while speedy winger Jacob Shaffelburg has had a breakout tournament.\n\nThere have been challenges.\n\nBombito was the victim of online racial abuse after a hard tackle on Messi in the tournament opener. And winger Tajon Buchanan broke his leg in training.\n\nMarsch made just one change to the starting 11 that beat Venezuela with Kone who scored the decisive penalty in the shootout after coming in on off the bench, slotting in for Jonathan Osorio.\n\nCanada looked to restrict the Argentines with its press from the get-go, coming forward with two early counterattacks that saw Shaffelburg fire shots off-target.\n\nMessi shot just wide in the 11th minute on an Argentine counterattack. And the ever-dangerous Argentina captain just missed again with a low shot late in the first half, followed by an attempted chip over Crepeau in stoppage time.\n\nArgentina 'keeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, sporting an Argentina flag dyed into the side of his hair, was called into action in the dying seconds of the half after Jonathan David got to an Alistair Johnston long throw-in, poking the ball toward goal from close range.\n\nFor the second game in a row, Argentina kept Canada waiting to start the second half. After Canada went down 2-0, Crepeau was called into action again to stop Alvarez.\n\nAli Ahmed, Liam Millar, Tani Oluwaseyi, Mathieu Choiniere and Osorio came on for Canada in the second half. The subs helped spark the offence with Canada threatening the South Americans as the clock wound down.\n\nOluwaseyi had two good chances in the dying minutes, with an acrobatic Martinez managing to get his body in front of the first shot in the 89th minute. The Canadian sub then saw his header just go wide.\n\nArgentina came into the semifinal having lost just once in 18 games (16-1-1) since defeating France via penalty shootout in the World Cup final in December 2022. The one loss during that run was a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Uruguay in World Cup qualifying in November. And the draw turned into the penalty shootout win over No. 30 Ecuador last time out.\n\nThat didn't deter Canadian rapper Drake from placing a $300,000 bet on Canada to win, a wager returning $2.88 million if successful. Drake posted the betting slip online, as he often does with his wagers.\n\nAfter losing to Argentina in the tournament opener, Canada beat No. 31 Peru 1-0 and tied No. 40 Chile 0-0 to finish second in Group A behind the Argentines. The Canadians then beat No. 54 Venezuela in a penalty shootout in the quarterfinal.\n\nArgentina is seeking its third major crown after the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup. The Argentines are tied with Uruguay for most Copa America titles with 15.\n\nWhen asked about Davies leaving the game after hurting his right leg in a challenge with Montiel, Marsch said: \"He's getting an X-ray, so we're hopeful he's OK, but we're not sure.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He reversed his decision seven weeks later and has scored 54 goals in 73 international appearances since, raising his matches for Argentina to 186 as he helped win the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup.\n\nTeammate Angel Di Maria does intend to retire after Sunday's game against Uruguay or Colombia at Miami Gardens, Florida.

There's nothing left to say that I haven't said a lot of times before,\" Di Maria explained. \"It's my last game. I have to say thank you to all Argentineans and to this generation that has allowed me to lift so many trophies.\"\n\nDi Maria joined with Messi to lead Argentina to it's third World Cup and 15th Copa America title.\n\n\"We've enjoyed him so much,\" Messi said. \"He's always given his all and the best of himself and that he will retire in a final is something he simply deserves.\"\n\nArgentina coach Lionel Scaloni held out hope Di Maria will reverse his decision.\n\n\"We don't want to start crying right now. We don't want to feel melancholy,\" Scaloni said. \"We have to let him play and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us.\"\n\nSouth American World Cup qualifying resumes in September, with each national team scheduled to play 12 more matches. The 2026 World Cup final will be at MetLife, that July 19.\n\n\"We will never be the ones to close the door,\" Scaloni said. \"He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great.

Messi trails only Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 130 goals for Portugal.\n\nDespite their two-goal cushion, Argentina had a nervy finish to the match as Canada substitute Tani Oluwaseyi tested Martinez with a crisp shot in the 89th minute before directing a glancing header wide a minute later.\n\nFor Canada, the defeat ends a remarkable run in which they defied expectations and performed better than their higher-ranked CONCACAF rivals Mexico and the United States, their fellow co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\"They're the best team in the world, but at the same time we had our chances in the beginning of the game,\" midfielder Stephen Eustaquio told Canadian broadcaster TSN.\n\n\"If we scored one of our chances, the story of the game would probably have been different. To get here, the last four of the Copa America, it's a big achievement.\"\n\n(Reporting by Aadi Nair in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Field Level Media; Editing by Peter Rutherford)", "source":

They saw a gutsy performance from Canada, albeit one lacking in clinical finishing, and pure class from Argentina, whose passing and buildup were straight out of a video game at times.\n\nThe Canadians also fell 2-0 to Argentina when they met in the June 20th tournament opener in Atlanta. Argentina thumped Canada 5-0 in their only other meeting, in May 2010 in Buenos Aires in the Argentines' final warm-up before the FIFA World Cup in South Africa.\n\nMessi and the Argentines will play either No. 12 Colombia or No. 14 Uruguay, who meet Wednesday in Charlotte, N.C., in Sunday's championship game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.\n\n\"It's insane what this team has done, what the Argentina national team is doing,\" Messi said. \"For those who remain from the old guard, it's beyond impressive that the national team is in another final.\"\n\nCanada heads to Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte for Saturday's third-place game.\n\nArgentina showed its quality, content to stroke the ball around and then change gears in an instant when it saw an opening in Canada's defence.\n\nAnd despite a positive start, Canada fell behind in the 22nd minute on Argentina's first shot on target. The Canadian defence was carved open by a long pass from Rodrigo De Paul that Alvarez controlled with a fine first touch before outmuscling Moise Bombito and slipping a shot through goalkeeper Max Crepeau's legs.\n\nCoach Jesse Marsch and the Canadian bench were irate, believing a foul by Argentina's Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico -- who steamrollered Richie Laryea as he tried to corral Crepeau's goal kick, allowing the South Americans to win possession -- had been missed before the goal. Eight touches later the ball was in the Canada net.\n\nBut Chilean referee Piero Maza was letting the teams play, much to Marsch's displeasure. The Canada coach eventually received a caution in the 77th minute for voicing his displeasure with the officiating.\n\nMessi made it 2-0 in the 51st minute with a slight redirect of an Enzo Fernandez shot through traffic after Canada failed to clear the ball. Canada had eight defenders in front of Crepeau in its penalty box but could not snuff out the threat.\n\nThe goal survived a video review check for offside with Messi getting the green light for his first goal of the tournament and his 14th in career Copa America play.\n\nCanada captain Alphonso Davies had to leave in the 71st minute after being injured in a hard tackle by Gonzalo Montiel that went unpunished.\n\nThere was some bad blood late in the game, with Argentina upset at Canadian midfielder Ismael Kone petulantly kicking the ball into one of their fallen players.\n\nMetLife Stadium's temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles.\n\n\"It's has been a very difficult Copa America, very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat,\" Messi said.\n\nThe Canadian men were looking to reach their first tournament final since the 2000 Gold Cup when they upset Colombia to win the CONCACAF crown.\n\nCanada, the last survivor of the six CONCACAF guest teams, is making its Copa debut. The Canadian men beat No. 99 Trinidad and Tobago 2-1 in a March playoff to make the 16-country field -- as the 11th-ranked team at the tournament.\n\nIt has been an eventful competition for the Canadian side under Marsch, the 50-year-old American who has infused his new team with youth and confidence as well as a new skipper in Davies.\n\nCrepeau has established himself as Canada's No. 1 goalkeeper. Bombito and Derek Cornelius have become the heart of the defence while speedy winger Jacob Shaffelburg has had a breakout tournament.\n\nThere have been challenges.\n\nBombito was the victim of online racial abuse after a hard tackle on Messi in the tournament opener. And winger Tajon Buchan broke his leg in training.\n\nMarsch made just one change to the starting 11 that beat Venezuela with Kone who scored the decisive penalty in the shootout after coming in on off the bench, slotting in for Jonathan Osorio.\n\nCanada looked to restrict the Argentines with its press from the get-go, coming forward with two early counterattacks that saw Shaffelburg fire shots off-target.\n\nMessi shot just wide in the 11th minute on an Argentine counterattack. And the ever-dangerous Argentina captain just missed again with a low shot late in the first half, followed by an attempted chip over Crepeau in stoppage time.\n\nArgentina 'keeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, sporting an Argentina flag dyed into the side of his hair, was called into action in the dying seconds of the half after Jonathan David got to an Alistair Johnston long throw-in, poking the ball toward goal from close range.\n\nFor the second game in a row, Argentina kept Canada waiting to start the second half. After Canada went down 2-0, Crepeau was called into action again to stop Alvarez.\n\nAli Ahmed, Liam Millar, Tani Oluwaseyi, Mathieu Choiniere and Osorio came on for Canada in the second half. The subs helped spark the offence with Canada threatening the South Americans as the clock wound down.\n\nOluwaseyi had two good chances in the dying minutes, with an acrobatic Martinez managing to get his body in front of the first shot in the 89th minute. The Canadian sub then saw his header just go wide.\n\nArgentina came into the semifinal having lost just once in 18 games (16-1-1) since defeating France via penalty shootout in the World Cup final in December 2022. The one loss during that run was a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Uruguay in World Cup qualifying in November. And the draw turned into the penalty shootout win over No. 30 Ecuador last time out.\n\nThat didn't deter Canadian rapper Drake from placing a $300,000 bet on Canada to win, a wager returning $2.88 million if successful. Drake posted the betting slip online, as he often does with his wagers.\n\nAfter losing to Argentina in the tournament opener, Canada beat No. 31 Peru 1-0 and tied No. 40 Chile 0-0 to finish second in Group A behind the Argentines. The Canadians then beat No. 54 Venezuela in a penalty shootout in the quarterfinal.\n\nArgentina is seeking its third major crown after the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup. The Argentines are tied with Uruguay for most Copa America titles with 15.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Argentina secured their place in the championship match with a convincing 2-0 victory over Canada on Tuesday.\n\nFollowing the win, Lionel Messi spoke to DSports Radio, acknowledging the twilight of his international career. \"Yes, I am aware that these are the last battles,\" he said. \"I am enjoying them to the fullest.\"\n\n\"It's not easy to be in a final again, we need to enjoy, enjoy every moment,\" he added, emphasizing the importance of cherishing this potentially final stage.\n\nThis victory marks Argentina's third consecutive major final appearance. They emerged victorious in the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup, solidifying their position as a dominant force in international football.\n\nLionel Messi himself opened his scoring account in this year's Copa America with a goal in the semifinal. This strike not only propelled Argentina towards victory but also propelled him past Iranian legend Ali Daei to become the second-highest international goal scorer of all time, with only Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of him.\n\nArgentina will face the winner of Wednesday's match between Uruguay and Colombia in the final on Sunday. A win would not only secure their second consecutive Copa America title but also etch their name in history as the team with the most Copa America titles (30).\n\nWhether this is truly Lionel Messi's final international hurrah remains to be seen.

It is tough because we know how hard it is to get there,\" Scaloni told reporters.\n\n\"The bar has been set very high. Everyone thought it was going to be a bed of roses and it wasn't like that at all. Canada proved it today by being a very difficult opponent.\"\n\nThis edition of the Copa America is likely to represent the last chance for many senior squad members to add to their trophy collection with the national team.\n\nAngel di Maria, 36, said last year he would retire from international football after the Copa America, while Messi, 37, and Nicolas Otamendi, 36, are both nearing the end of their careers.\n\n\"You know how I feel about Angel. We don't want to retire him earlier than needed,\" Scaloni said.\n\n\"We don't want to feel melancholy. We have to let him play, and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us. But so far, he's here, and he has to be allowed to enjoy this moment.\n\n\"For Leo (Messi), it's similar to Angel. We have to let him be and we will never be the ones to close the door. He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great.\"\n\nIn Sunday's final, Argentina could face either Uruguay, who beat them in a World Cup qualifier in November, or Colombia, who are on a 27-match unbeaten run under coach Nestor Lorenzo.\n\n\"These two potential opponents are top-notch national teams, but it would be reckless to say that I prefer one or the other,\" Scaloni said.\n\n\"One of them already beat us. It was a very tough match. We have not played against Colombia with this coach, but we know it could be very difficult as well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Aadi Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 29, "textEnd": 35}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Canada's attempt at a resurgence in the second half was dealt a major blow when Messi took centre stage and scored in the 51st minute.\n\nThe goal not only put an end to Canada's chances of scripting a fightback but also helped Messi become only the second player to score goals in six editions of the CONMEBOL Copa Am\u00e9rica alongside Zizinho of Brazil.\n\nOther than 2024, Messi scored in the 2007, 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2021 editions of the tournament. On the other hand, Zizinho scored in the six editions of the prestigious tournament held between 1942 and 1957.\n\nThe 2011 edition was the only forgettable outing for Messi as he couldn't score a goal in the entire tournament and Argentina had also failed to secure a semifinal berth.\n\nMessi's goal also helped him move past Ali Daei to become the second-leading goal scorer in the history of international football. Messi has scored 109 goals in an Argentina jersey - one more than Iran's Daei.\n\nMessi has moved closer to Cristiano Ronaldo who is the leading goal scorer in international football history.\n\nMeanwhile, the second semifinal of the tournament will be played between Uruguay and a spirited Colombian side at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zizinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Daei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Daei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/untitled-design-2024-07-10t090553-1720582566.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

It is tough because we know how hard it is to get there,\" Scaloni told reporters.\n\n\"The bar has been set very high. Everyone thought it was going to be a bed of roses and it wasn't like that at all. Canada proved it today by being a very difficult opponent.\"\n\nThis edition of the Copa America is likely to represent the last chance for many senior squad members to add to their trophy collection with the national team.\n\nAngel di Maria, 36, said last year he would retire from international football after the Copa America, while Messi, 37, and Nicolas Otamendi, 36, are both nearing the end of their careers.\n\n\"You know how I feel about Angel. We don't want to retire him earlier than needed,\" Scaloni said.\n\n\"We don't want to feel melancholy. We have to let him play, and then we'll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us. But so far, he's here, and he has to be allowed to enjoy this moment.\n\n\"For Leo (Messi), it's similar to Angel. We have to let him be and we will never be the ones to close the door. He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great.\"\n\nIn Sunday's final, Argentina could face either Uruguay, who beat them in a World Cup qualifier in November, or Colombia, who are on a 27-match unbeaten run under coach Nestor Lorenzo.\n\n\"These two potential opponents are top-notch national teams, but it would be reckless to say that I prefer one or the other,\" Scaloni said.\n\n\"One of them already beat us. It was a very tough match. We have not played against Colombia with this coach, but we know it could be very difficult as well.\"\n\nReporting by Aadi Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@reuters.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IKDOA7T64NIATHOFIYW36I6OSA.jpg?auth=f2325cd3c16ce605aba881be6d2996edaacdce742b21c42d9bdaa3be42afedf4&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 29, "textEnd": 35}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Interstingly, with Argentina entering the finals, Messi moved one step closer to breaking his rival Cristiano Ronaldo's record, and this was what got King Ryan's attention.\n\nGarcia took to social media after the semi-final between Canada and Argentina to congratulate Messi. The accompanying picture was a Bleacher Report photo of Messi sitting on a chair with Ronaldo standing above him with his hands out, while the caption read,\n\n\"Congrats Messi.\"\n\nLast night, Argentina took on Canada in the first Semi-final of the Copa America. The match started well for Argentina who took a lead in the 22nd minute thanks to Julian Alvarez. Moreover, six minutes after the second half began, Messi doubled the lead by scoring in the 51st minute to seal a win for Argentina. In the process, he took his nation to a record seventh final in major competitions, five Copa America finals, and two World Cup finals.\n\nHe also increased his goal tally for the national team to 109 goals and is just 21 goals behind Ronaldo who holds the record at 130 goals for his country. Messi and his team will now await the result of the second semi-final to see if they face Uruguay or Colombia. Argentina are defending champions and will be aiming to hold onto that title this time around as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Messi supporter Garcia is currently facing one major issue after another thanks to his inability to filter his thoughts before sharing them on social media.\n\nA few weeks back, Garcia was banned from boxing for a year after testing positive for Ostarine. Fast forward a few weeks and the boxer got into further trouble, as he made a few homophobic, racist, and Islamophobic comments on Twitter's Spaces platform.\n\nThis resulted in WBC chief Mauricio Sulaiman suspending him indefinitely even though Garcia apologized for his comments. Nevertheless, he won't sit out the ban idly, as 'King' recently announced he would be taking up the role of coach for his brother Sean Garcia who got knocked out in his recent outing.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_binoy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Kevin Binoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Garcia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Garcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/c49ae040-untitled-design1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The biggest avenue in Argentina is also called 'Avenida 9 de Julio' commemorating the day year-round for the millions who traverse it.\n\nWith seven lanes going in each direction, it is also the widest avenue in the world. While not as grand, yesterday's Argentine victory on that same date over Canada that leads them once again to the Copa America finals, was more cause for celebration on an already festive day.\n\nThe Argentinian National team delivered a repeat performance besting Canada by the same score as they did in the opening tournament match 2-0, while Julian Alvarez did a repeat by scoring goals in both games.\n\nWhile the defending champions celebrated in style in Miami, the current home of Lionel Messi, Canada still looks to compete for third place on Saturday against whichever team comes up short tonight between Colombia and Uruguay.

however, he was unable to do so and came off as a substitute.\n\nCanada tried to beat Argentina, in its first participation in a Copa Am\u00e9rica in which it ended up being the best CONCACAF national team during this tournament.\n\nThe team led by Jesse Marsch wants to culminate its historic performance by taking third place in Copa America next Saturday when they will face the loser of Colombia vs Uruguay.\n\nThe post Copa America: Victory on Independence Day, a date for celebration was first published on UNANIMO Sports.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Montiel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gonzalo Montiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zizinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Osorio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Osorio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ql47pc/picture289907624/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/3bf160f5-1643-4bb5-90bd-4ffecd095b7d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 8}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 78, "textEnd": 86}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

With Argentina in another Copa America final, these may be his 'last battles'", "body": "In this same place two Olympiads ago, Lionel Messi shuffled through a corridor looking as insignificant as he ever has inside a football stadium. This was the venue where his international career died.\n\nHe had turned 29 two days earlier. He had bashed a penalty kick over the bar in the Copa America Centenario final. He had been compared relentlessly to Maradona and his legend. He had finished yet another tournament without leading Argentina to a title.\n\n\"The national team is not for me,\" Messi said that night, following a penalty shootout loss to Chile.\n\nTuesday, he earned his 73rd cap since deciding he'd had enough.\n\nHe scored his 54th goal since returning to international duty.\n\nAnd, most important, he earned a spot in his third consecutive major tournament final with a 2-0 Copa America semifinal victory over Canada.\n\nArgentina won the other two, the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup, breaking a decades-long trophy drought that haunted Messi more than anyone. It's all made his decision to end that brief retirement from the national team wonderfully rewarding.\n\nArgentina now, in Sunday evening's final against the winner between Uruguay and Colombia, can become the second team ever to win three major titles in a row, joining the Spain group that won the 2008 Euros, 2010 World Cup, and 2012 Euros.\n\nAnd, as if to verify that Met Life Stadium in New Jersey is where he makes his biggest statements, one way or the other, he said during a shirtless pitch-side interview, \"These are the last battles ... that is why I'm enjoying it to the fullest.\"\n\nWait, did he just do it again?\n\nWith another World Cup coming to the States in 2026? With his powers not apparently diminishing as he's less than a month past his 37th birthday and performing at a superlative level for Inter Miami in Major League Soccer and with the Argentines in this event? He can't be serious about stopping now. Maybe he meant the last battles of this Copa tournament?\n\nThe crowd of more than 80,000 that showed up for Tuesday's game hoping to get a glimpse of what's made Messi the greatest soccer player in history got a huge dose of his extraordinary gifts. They had to watch closely, though.\n\nThe greatest plays in soccer are not always as conspicuous as an Anthony Edwards slam dunk. One of Messi's best moments against Canada didn't even involve him touching the ball. On a forward move early in the second half, he faked as if he were going to accept a pass and let it roll through to a teammate - a \"dummy\"- but Argentina just couldn't turn that threatening moment into a legitimate scoring chance.\n\nSoon after, in the 51st minute, he dashed in front of Enzo Fernandez's shot from the top of the box and just slightly nicked the ball, which redirected it slightly and allowed it to slip into the right corner of the goal. It was his 109th international goal, passing Iran's Ali Daei to rank second all-time among men's players.\n\nIt looked, immediately, as though he'd fouled up a sure goal from Fernandez. In fact, Canada's Maxine Crepeau probably would have deflected the shot wide if Messi had chosen not to get involved. It looked as though Messi was well offside as he intersected with the ball, as no defender aside from the keeper was behind him as he struck it. Canada's Derek Cornelius had even attempted to dash upfield past Messi and trap him offside, but he wasn't nearly quick enough.\n\nTo win a third consecutive major trophy after all the harangues he endured -- all the suspicion that he did not identify as Argentine because he'd left the country at 13 and spent the majority of his life in Barcelona -- would be the best sort of vindication. At this point, though, why not a fourth?\n\nSo many of the guys on that Spain team a dozen years ago were Messi's teammates with FC Barcelona back then: Andres Iniesta, Xavi, Sergio Busquets, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique. One more win, and he'll be able to boast just as loudly about his national team accomplishments as they could for the past decade.\n\nIf he chooses to stick around another couple years, though, four in a row is not out of the question. Argentina's core of young players - Lautaro Martinez, Alexis Mac Allister, Fernandez - may be the best national team of which he's been a part. They're surely the most accomplished. because they've accomplished something.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They were smartly dressed, as ever. And they hovered near the gates in the hope that some people might be for turning. There was only one problem - the tens of thousands of Argentina fans who flocked here have already chosen their God.\n\nAnd for the next few hours they sung his name and they bowed in his direction. Even at 37, even after struggling with injury, even after missing a penalty in the quarter final, even after a few games without a goal, Lionel Messi continues to repay that devotion.\n\nHe was not always at his mesmerizing best here but he still won man of the match and he still scored the decisive second as defending champions Argentina beat Canada to reach the final of Copa America - and the door leading to immortality.\n\nWhat a time to find his first goal of the tournament. Messi is now the second highest scorer in international soccer history - behind only Cristiano Ronaldo; Lionel Scaloni's side are now one game away from winning a third successive major tournament. No South American team has ever done a Copa America-World Cup-Copa America treble.\n\nJulian Alvarez set them on the road to Miami - Messi's adopted home - with a neatly worked goal midway through the first half. Then, shortly after the restart, the Argentina captain sealed victory, turning home Enzo Fernandez's shot from a few yards out.\n\nIt meant that this semifinal ended with the same scoreline as when these two teams met in the tournament's opening game. What that belies, however, is the remarkable progress made by Jesse Marsch and Canada en route to this point.\n\nIn the country's first Copa America, only a couple of months after appointing the American manager, Canada has broken new ground. Two years out from a home World Cup, this team looks to have turned a corner towards brighter days.\n\nFor a team ranked No 48 in the world, this has been a brilliant run featuring breakout victories over Peru and Venezuela. Canada was the better team until the opening goal here. Penny for the thoughts of those at US Soccer HQ, then. Marsch was overlooked in favor of Gregg Berhalter. But after America crashed and burned, he has led Canada to new heights.\n\n'We've had a wonderful five, six weeks together and it's gone way better than any of us could have expected,' Marsch said.\n\n'We've built really good foundations... I took this job seven weeks ago, I couldn't have imagined that I'd be here.'\n\nAfter only a couple of training sessions, Marsch feared his side could be in for a tough summer. 'We're way ahead of where I thought we could have possibly been.'\n\nThis game always appeared a bridge too far. Scaloni has built a winning machine that has already won this tournament in 2021 and the 2022 World Cup. Now only Uruguay or Colombia can stop Argentina from securing a record 16th Copa America. Not quite the fool's errand of those Jehovah's Witnesses. But no simple feat.\n\n'People think we are different from other Argentineans but we are not,' Scaloni said. 'We all understand what it means to wear this jersey.'\n\nOn the possibility of making history, he added: 'These are statistics, I'm not really interested in it... the most important thing is to win, not what the statistics say: that we could win three finals in a row.'\n\nA few hours before kick-off, supporters were already passing soccer balls around the parking lots outside Metlife Stadium. They spanned different generations and they wore different jerseys. But almost every fan carried the same name. Together they stitched together the tapestry of Messi's career. Argentina, Barcelona, Inter Miami.\n\nOn Tuesday night, almost a year to the day since he arrived in America, almost two years to the day until the World Cup final comes to this stadium, Messi arrived on the cusp of yet more history.\n\nIn the lots and in the stands, there was the odd pocket of Canada red. Beyond that, though, Jersey was a sea of blue and white. Argentina fans drank and danced. One set off fireworks. Those Jehovah's Witnesses stood and watched.\n\nThis tournament has brought a few reminders of Messi's fragility. Since these two teams met on opening night, the 37-year-old had battled injury and then, against Ecuador, he missed from the penalty spot.\n\nCanada went on its own wild ride over the past two and half weeks, too. That represents a reasonable chunk of Marsch's reign and the manager insisted his team had grown aplenty on this unlikely run.\n\nCanada stifled the defending champions for a while in Atlanta and Marsch's side made a nerveless start here. No matter that this was one of the biggest nights in the team's history. No matter that Metlife was a tinderbox. Supporters turned up the noise - and bowed in unison - after Messi dragged an early shot wide.\n\nEither side of that, though, it was Canada who created the brightest openings. New hero Jacob Shaffelburg had a couple of shooting chances; Marsch's side looked dangerous every time they burst forward.\n\nBut the manager had already begun to sense that this fairytale run was catching up with his players. And he was right. The rug was pulled from beneath Canada in an instant.\n\nRodrigo de Paul was given too much time near halfway and the midfielder clipped a ball into the path of Alvarez. The Manchester City forward found a pocket of space, rode Moise Bombito's challenge and broke the deadlock - just as he did against Canada in the group stages.\n\nIt represented vindication for Scaloni, who picked Alvarez over the tournament's top scorer, Lautaro Martinez. It was a brutal reminder, too, that the world's best teams won't always fire warning shots.\n\nMarsch wasn't happy - the Canada boss wanted a foul in the build-up to the goal. By half-time, however, he will have been relieved that the deficit was only one. For a while after the goal, Canada was clinging on. Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Tagliafico both came close before Messi worked some space inside the area, only to pull his shot wide.\n\nHe made no mistake a few minutes later, when Fernandez fired a shot towards goal from the edge of the box. Messi appeared to be in an offside position when he diverted the ball into the net. He wasn't. And so the goal stood and Canada fell towards its sword.\n\nMarsch's team kept pushing and Canada created a couple of glorious late chances for substitute Tani Oluwaseyi. By then, though, many of the 80,000-strong crowd - which included Brazilian great Ronaldo - had started the party early.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He forced a tidy save from Martinez with his low effort from 15 yards first, and moments later, he headed just wide after Jonathan Osorio's cross.\n\nUNI XINHUA GNK", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Univision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Shaffelburg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Shaffelburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Cr\u00e9peau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxime Cr\u00e9peau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_De_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo De Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tani_Oluwaseyi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tani Oluwaseyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismael_Kone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismael Kone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.uniindia.com/cms/gall_content/2024/7/2024_7$largeimg10_Jul_2024_135328137.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 19}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

(twice) and from the penalty spot (via Mbappe against Poland).\n\n... and team-mates on the Spain bench couldn't believe what they had seen.\n\nA goal so good it was worth seeing for a second

to a third for Spain...\n\nSpain will now play in Sunday's final bidding for a fourth European title.\n\nLater, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Argentina saw off Canada to reach Sunday's Copa

he couldn't capitalise, dragging a right-foot shot just wide of the post.\n\nCanada coach Jesse Marsch appeared to be fuming at halftime...\n\n... and he won't have been any happier when Messi finally broke his duck for the tournament just after the break.\n\nThe goal, a 14th in Copa history for the Inter Miami star, was a significant one as he broke a tie to move second all time on the men's international goalscorers list.\n\nIt was the goal the fans in Miami had been waiting for.\n\nArgentina now return to the final for the fourth time in five attempts.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

The Argentine has been on the end of his fair share of criticism thus far at Copa America. With good reason, too. He had been far short of his usual standards in his nation's colors.\n\nAll of that was laid to rest on Tuesday night, though. Messi, along with the rest of this well-drilled Argentina team showed up in style. They beat Canada 2-0, but in reality it was never really that close.\n\nLa Albiceleste strolled through the game for the most part.\n\nAlvarez may have done enough to earn himself a spot in the XI for good here, with the Man City forward finally finding his best at the right time. Messi, meanwhile, was his usual self.\n\nClean, concise, and in the right place at the right time. Age aside, he's crucial to their success.\n\nCanada offered some attacking ideas. They have certainly improved in such a short period of time under Jesse Marsch.\n\n\"I've been saying that it'll be hard when we're all done to say goodbye because I've really enjoyed the process with this team, and I think we've made a lot of progress together,\" Marsch said speaking postgame. \"I took this job seven l weeks ago. I couldn't have imagined that I'd be right here right now...I'm really happy with the team and really happy with the progress.\"\n\nAlphonso Davies caused problems, but exited the game with an injury - and Canada's dreams died with his substitution late.

Messi has eight Ballon d'Or trophies to Ronaldo's five. Messi has 12 domestic top-flight titles in European football (10 La Liga titles with Barcelona and two Ligue 1 trophies with Paris Saint-Germain) while Ronaldo has seven, spread across spells in England with Manchester United, Spain with Real Madrid and Italy with Juventus. They have each won their continent's most prized international tournament, Ronaldo lifting the European Championship in 2016 and Messi the Copa America in 2021.\n\nMessi, however, is not ahead by every metric. Ronaldo has one more Champions League winners' medal (five) than Messi's four. Ronaldo has more club goals (765) than Messi (729) but Messi loyalists will point out that Messi has more assists at club level (354) than Ronaldo (238).\n\nWhoever you may favour, this has for a long time been the defining duopoly of modern football. Ronaldo was Real Madrid and Messi was Barcelona. Ronaldo is Nike and Messi is Adidas. It has been the subject of a book by two journalists from the Wall Street Journal, entitled: Messi vs. Ronaldo: One Rivalry, Two GOATs, and the Era That Remade the World's Game. There is a website, MessivsRonaldo, where you can pour over their competing records and find the statistic that best suits your narrative.\n\nBut one man stood between the duopoly and that man was Ali Daei, the Iran forward who scored 108 goals for his country between 1993 and 2006. This placed him joint-second with Messi in the all-time highest goalscoring list of men's internationals. Ronaldo is top, with 130 goals. Daei's club career was nowhere near as striking, scoring 134 goals across 13 years, and barely making a mark at the highest level of European club football.\n\nBy scoring Argentina's second goal against Canada in their 2-0 semi-final win, sealing his nation's place in back-to-back Copa America finals, Messi moved onto 109 goals, cementing Ronaldo and Messi's No 1 and No 2 status for all-time international scorers. To put this into its historical context, the Brazil great Pele scored 77 goals in 92 appearances, while the Argentine Diego Maradona scored 34 goals in 91 appearances.\n\nOnly six other players have crossed the 80-goal threshold; Poland's Robert Lewandowski (83), Hungary's Ferenc Puskas (84), Belgium's Romelu Lukaku (85) and then there is Ali Mabkhout of the United Arab Emirates (85), Malaysia's Mokhtar Dahari (89) and India's Sunil Chhetri (94). The latter three all benefited from playing within confederations where the level of football is distinctly lower.\n\nAs Messi moved into second, it begged the question as to whether the 21-goal difference between Messi (109) and Ronaldo (130) is one that may yet be overturned. Ronaldo has endured a rotten summer, starting every game of Portugal's Euro 2024 run, which ended in the quarter-final against France, but failing to score any goals outside of penalty shootouts (sorry Cristiano, but we aren't counting those towards these records). It has opened a discussion as to whether Ronaldo, who turns 40 in February, may end his international career.\n\nThe Portugal captain wrote on social media after Friday's defeat against France there may be another tournament in him yet. He said: \"We wanted more. We deserved more. For us. For each one of you. For Portugal. We are grateful for everything you have given us and for everything we have achieved. On and off the field, I am sure that this legacy will be honoured and will continue to be built. Together.\"\n\nPortugal coach Roberto Martinez said after his team's exit that it was \"too soon\" to say if Ronaldo, 39, had played his last game for his country. Ronaldo has previously said \"I don't follow the records. They follow me,\" implying a humility that has not always been visible in his demeanour while playing for Portugal or his club sides in recent years.\n\nAnd some of those records are extraordinary. The leading goalscorer in men's international football, the first man to appear and score in five European Championship and first to score in five different World Cups.\n\n\"What's there left to beat?\" Ronaldo asked in June 2023. \"I have no idea. I know that there are records that I hold.\"\n\nShould he carry on until 2026, where the World Cup will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, then Messi is seriously up against it to catch Ronaldo, who would be able to compete in World Cup qualifying, the UEFA Nations League and a World Cup itself, as well as international friendlies. That would take drastic underperformance from Ronaldo and extraordinary levels from Messi over the coming two years to catch.\n\nYet, should Ronaldo decide to hang up his international boots, then Messi may fancy a shot at one of Ronaldo's remaining records. Messi has just turned 37, two years the junior of his rival, and he is the more efficient international goalscorer. Messi has 109 goals in 186 caps, a goal every 1.7 games, while Ronaldo's 130 goals have been scored across 212 games, a goal every 1.63 games.\n\nThere are opportunities to score 21 goals. A Copa America final awaits in Miami on Sunday evening, against Uruguay or Colombia, while a further 12 games remain for Argentina in the CONMEBOL (South American) section of the World Cup qualification system.\n\nThere are then international friendly matches to consider, as well as a potential Finalissima between the winners of Euro 2024 and this summer's Copa America, if CONMEBOL and UEFA can find a date within the system.\n\nThen, should Argentina reach the final of the World Cup, that would be eight matches within the tournament to reach it. So there are 22 possible competitive games, before we even take into account friendlies. This all works under the presumption that Messi carries on for another World Cup, having achieved his dream by lifting the trophy in Qatar in 2022.\n\nMore pressingly, there is the small matter of attempting to win a second consecutive Copa America for his country. Yet, at the back of his mind, Messi may have one final riposte for Ronaldo.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Argentina had to work, think and sweat at MetLife Stadium on Tuesday night in the first leg of two Copa semi-finals. They sometimes had to stomach the initial fear.\n\nBut they beat Canada 2-0 in Sunday's final. Their clincher was perhaps Lionel Messi's most subtle, simple goal, his debut. And their breakthrough, midway through the first half, was straightforward -- literally.\n\nIt only required two passes. The first, from Christian Romero to Rodrigo de Paul, was harmless. But the second Argentine found Canada's killer, Julian Alvarez.\n\nHis first touch was excellent. His second left Canadian defender Moise Pompidou on the grass. His third beat goalkeeper Maxime Cr\u00e9peau to give Argentina the lead.\n\nThree weeks ago, it was Alvarez who broke the deadlock when these two teams met in the opening game of the 2024 Copa America. It lasted 48 minutes that night in Atlanta, Canada. Here, it lasted only 22.\n\nIn those 22 minutes, the Underdogs were lively. They found openings. They advanced on the counter. threatened\n\nBut they don't have the quality to jump at opportunities. Once they agreed, they were toast.\n\nMessi buried the Reds before half-time with a classic feint and right-footed shot.\n\nFive minutes after the break, he buried them.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has scored the most goals in his illustrious career, setting the record straight in the 2024 Copa America. He slides a pass to De Paul. He continued his run. After some penalty-box pinball, he poked his leg at an Enzo Fernandez shot and half-punched, half-glared into the net.\n\nHe looked at the assistant referee and didn't know if he was in. But he was, so he slowly jumped into Enzo's arms and felt a feeling he hadn't felt since October in a competitive Argentina game.\n\nHe looked relatively pedestrian in the three Copa America games before 2024. Apparently, so was Argentina.\n\nAlbiceleste That opener against Canada was vulnerable. They needed a late and lucky Lautaro Martinez goal to beat Chile. They rested the starters in a meaningless group final against Peru. They needed a penalty shootout - and a heroic goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez - to keep Ecuador in the quarter-finals.\n\nSo they didn't prove they could be world champions in this semi-final. At times, they seemed to run out of attacking ideas.\n\nBut they had enough to win back Canada; They are occasionally dull but adequate.\n\nThey are good enough to reach the final of their third major tournament in a row, where they will meet either Colombia or Uruguay, their first formidable opponent of the summer.\n\nWhether they prove anything is not so relevant.

(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The decisive moment of Argentina's penultimate step toward a Copa Am\u00e9rica repeat was just like the rest of the climb: simple.\n\nIt wasn't easy. The Argentines had to work, and think, and sweat here at MetLife Stadium on a steamy Tuesday night, in the first of two Copa semifinals. They had to stomach the occasional early scare.\n\nBut they brushed aside Canada, 2-0, to reach Sunday's final. Their clincher was perhaps the most subtle, plain goal Lionel Messi will ever score, his first of the tournament. And their breakthrough, midway through the first half, was straightforward -- literally.\n\nIt required only two passes, from center back to central midfielder, then central midfielder to center forward. The first, from Cristian Romero to Rodrigo De Paul, was harmless. But the second found Argentina's Canada killer, Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez.\n\nHis first touch was excellent. His second left Canadian defender Mo\u00efse Bombito on the grass. His third beat goalkeeper Maxime Cr\u00e9peau, and put Argentina ahead.\n\nIt was \u00c1lvarez who had broken through three weeks earlier, when these two teams met in the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica opener. On that night in Atlanta, Canada lasted 48 minutes. Here, it lasted only 22.\n\nIn those 22 minutes, the underdogs were frisky. They detected openings. They sprung forward on the counter. They threatened.\n\nBut they didn't quite have the quality to pounce on opportunities. And once they conceded, they were toast.\n\nMessi, with a classic feint and a right-footed shot, nearly buried the Reds right before halftime.\n\nSome five minutes after halftime, he did bury them.\n\nHe got off the mark at the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica, ironically, with one of the most Cristiano Ronaldo goals of his glittering career. He slid a pass to De Paul. He continued his run. After some penalty-box pinball, he stabbed his foot at an Enzo Fernandez shot, and half-poked, half-caressed it into the net.\n\nHe glanced at the assistant referee, unsure whether he was onside. But he was, so he gently leapt into Enzo's arms, and felt a feeling he hadn't felt in a competitive Argentina game since October.\n\nHe had looked relatively pedestrian in three prior 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica games. And frankly, Argentina had as well.\n\nLa Albiceleste looked vulnerable in that opener against Canada. They needed a late and lucky Lautaro Martinez goal to beat Chile. They rested starters in a meaningless group finale against Peru. They then needed a penalty shootout -- and a heroic goalkeeper, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez -- to survive Ecuador in the quarterfinals.\n\nSo they entered this semifinal as unproven as a world champion can be.

When others have fallen, Argentina is building its empire brick-by-brick, frustrating its opponents with its signature brand of soccer.\n\nThis dynasty is led by youthful, yet experienced players. Enzo Fernandez assisted Argentina's winning goal and was vital in possession, but is only 23. Julian Alvarez is just 24, but with the maturity and calmness in his play, he could have played decades' worth of soccer.\n\nFor the group's leaders -- veterans rapidly reaching the formidable 40-year-old mark -- they played like they were 20. 37-year-old Lionel Messi reminded the world of his legendary status, scoring his first goal of the tournament after running a clinic on destroying Canadian defenses.\n\nAngel Di Maria was the team's creative outlet -- the 36-year-old ran rampant down the right flank. Argentina looked the most complete and dominant it has in a while, and that's saying a lot considering their recent performances.\n\nWhen the match started, it looked like Argentina would be the next world empire to crumble. For a minute, left winger Jacob Shaffelburg seemed unstoppable as Canada broke loose in transition several times. Shaffelburg, Alphonso Davies, and a speedy Canada team often proved too much for the physical Canadian sides to handle.\n\nWe saw how fast and frustrating Canada could be at times. Jonathan David's counter-attacking strike against Peru and Shaffelburg's goal over Venezuela both come from Canada surging quickly through fast-break goals on the wings. The Jesse Marsch-led Canadians are difficult to deal with, as the Argentine defense discovered first-hand.\n\nAlthough Shaffelburg flirted with the net a few times in the opening minutes, sending two shots off target, Rodrigo de Paul drew first blood in the 22nd minute. De Paul dropped deep between Canada's midfield lines, turned, and launched a 40-yard ball right into the path of Julian Alvarez. The City attacker deftly controlled the ball, withstood a sliding Moise Bombito tackle, and converted the one-on-one to put Argentina ahead.\n\nTowards the end of the half, frustration boiled over for the red-and-white. After Derek Cornelius flicked on an Alistair Johnson long throw, Jonathan David's flicked-on effort was met with an amazing Emiliano Martinez stop at the near post. You could see fatigue scrawled on the players' faces, along with visible annoyance from Marsch towards the end of halftime after some questionable calls.\n\nThe game slowed down after Argentina got a hold of the game. Argentina patiently and slowly cut open the Canadian defense, often passing it around the backline and sniffing out opportunities. Argentina preferred to slowly draw Canada out with their slow build-up, and then attack. It helped them draw time off the clock.\n\nArgentina's second strike came through Messi himself. After halftime, Messi took the ball on the right wing before playing it to De Paul. De Paul reached the byline and cut the ball back to Messi, but Ismael Kone made a smart interception. But, Kone's clearance landed right at Enzo Fernandez's feet. Fernandez fired a shot on goal, but Messi's flick helped thoroughly beat Canada keeper Maxime Crepeau.\n\nThe game looked all but finished as Emiliano Martinez came up with another save after his penalty heroics against Ecuador. After a clumsy giveaway, the ball worked its way to Tani Oluwaseyi. Oluwaseyi launched his shot on goal, but Martinez deflected the ball with his feet before collecting the ball. Only minutes later, Oluwaseyi connected with a Jonathan Osorio cross, but he steered his header narrowly wide of the post.\n\nAn emotional Martinez, with the Argentine flag dyed into his hair, lifted his hands to the sky and collapsed. Relief and fatigue washed over the Argentine squad, who will earn five days of rest until the final.\n\nThey'll learn about their opponents in the finals on Wednesday. Argentina will either face Colombia, who hasn't lost since March 2022, or Uruguay, their fierce derby rivals. Either way, it promises to be thrilling, intense, and vital for the Argentine core's legacy.\n\nYes, I am aware that these are the last battles... I am enjoying them to the fullest,\" a grinning Messi admitted. \"It's not easy to be in a final again. We need to enjoy, enjoy every moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Shaffelburg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Shaffelburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_De_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo De Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Osorio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Osorio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Cornelius", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Cornelius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tani_Oluwaseyi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tani Oluwaseyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismael_Kone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismael Kone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Cr\u00e9peau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxime Cr\u00e9peau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panagiotis_Kone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panagiotis Kone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240710_WST_515498_Argentina-Canada-1.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Scaloni faced the media on Monday as the reigning World Cup champions prepare to face Canada in the Copa America 2024 semifinals. The tournament, which is being hosted by the United States, is being played simultaneously with Euro 2024.\n\nThe competitions are widely considered to be the top two international soccer tournaments outside of the World Cup. Because of this, there is a typical debate over which competition has more quality overall. Joining this discussion, reporters recently asked Scaloni his opinion on the matter.\n\nThe Argentine initially went back and forth about whether his team could win the Euros. He finally, however, asserted that there is not much difference overall between the two tournaments.\n\n\"I think the level is very even,\" claimed Scaloni. \"And, I would like a European team to one day be invited to a Copa America to see what it is like to play in a Copa America and the opposite, as well. But that would be a World Cup, right? So, in the end, the difficulty is the same. I don't think there's much difference, really. But these are just opinions.\"\n\nScaloni's answer to the question is hardly surprising. After all, the tournaments are fairly similar in quality, particularly in the upper echelon. His team, Argentina, also topped the Netherlands, Croatia, and France on the way to their World Cup triumph in Qatar. All three of these European sides have featured at Euro 2024 across Germany.\n\nNevertheless, there certainly seems to be more quality in depth at the Euros compared to the Copa America. Argentina and Brazil are undeniably the two top teams in CONMEBOL. Both teams are filled with superstars who feature among the best clubs in the world. They have also combined to collect nine of the last 14 Copa America titles since 1989.\n\nArgentina and Brazil are also, however, the only Copa America 2024 sides in FIFA's top 10 at the moment. In total, seven Copa America teams rank in the governing body's top 30 list. Euro 2024, on the other hand, makes up exactly half of FIFA's current top 30 teams. Two more European sides, Sweden and Wales, also feature in this particular list but failed to qualify for the tournament.\n\nFIFA rankings are, however, obviously are not all that matters. After all, Brazil surprisingly crashed out of the Copa America at the hands of Uruguay. 48th-ranked Canada has also excelled at the competition and will play Argentina for a place in the final. Georgia, currently ranked 74th overall, shocked the sport by qualifying for the round of 16 at the Euros as well.\n\nOutside of just looking at the rankings, Euro 2024 has just been more competitive than Copa America 2024. For instance, there was not one single team at the European competition to lose all three of their group stage games. Three Copa America sides, on the other hand, failed to even grab a point at the tournament. Jamaica, Bolivia, and Paraguay all lost every match while allowing 25 total combined goals.\n\nDepth is where Euro 2024 ends the argument. Yes, the top CONMEBOL sides could certainly fight for a European title. However, Copa America is undeniably top-heavy. The European competition, on the other hand, has parity from top to bottom.\n\nThis is also clearly evident when looking at the past. While Argentina and Brazil have won nine of the last 14 Copa Americas, there have been eight different Euros winners in the last nine competitions. Spain is currently the only European team to triumph more than once at the tournament since 1988.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"},

I've done everything I could to achieve that. It's my job. I do the job I have to do. I always try to do my best. I always gave my life for this shirt.\n\n\"There were times when I wasn't lucky. Lately, I have been really lucky. I am grateful to everyone who has always supported me, to my family and to this team that gave me everything.\n\n\"Today before the match, Leo [Messi] said that they wanted to reach the final for me and that makes me very proud. To have the chance to achieve everything I've achieved recently with all of them is a source of pride for me.\"\n\nDi Maria's final match for Argentina will come against Uruguay or Colombia at the 65,326 capacity Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Having earned 144 international caps for Argentina, contributing 31 goals and 32 assists over the course of 16 years of international football, Di Maria is the country's fourth highest appearance maker.\n\nHe also confirmed that his team-mates tried to convince him to reverse his decision to retire from international football. Despite their best attempts, he insists next week will be the right time to walk away.\n\nHe added: \"I'm not ready for my last game with the national team, but it's time. I dreamed of this and my dream came true, reaching another final.\n\n\"My team-mates already know that there is no turning back, that my mind is made up. They support the decision I made. There's only one game left. It's what I wanted. I feel it's the right time. That's it.\n\n\"I gave everything I had to give. I gave my life for this shirt and I think it's the perfect time to say goodbye. It's decided. There is no turning back.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

And he and Messi starred once more in La Albiceleste's 2-0 victory over surprise Copa America semi-finalists Canada.\n\nArgentina now have an excellent opportunity to win their third major international tournament in four years, having triumphed in the competition in 2021 and the World Cup in 2022 - a match which saw Di Maria win the penalty that led to Argentina's first goal before scoring the second on the stroke of half-time. With Di Maria set to retire after the competition in the United States, Messi made a promise which left his long-term team-mate emotional.\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United reveal \u00a340m takeover cost and exact Sir Jim Ratcliffe investment\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United record \u00a371m loss after European exit amid cost and transfer warning\n\nAt the end of the match, Di Maria said: \"I think I can leave with a great performance.

The second semi-final takes place in Charlotte on Wednesday night.\n\nArgentina, the heavy tournament favourites, were much improved over their quarter-final win against Ecuador - when Emi Mart\u00ednez was once again needed to get his team through a penalty shootout. However, a sterner test will need to be passed for Lionel Scaloni's team if the world champions are to reassert their dominance over the Americas.\n\nIt was the Canadians who had the better of the opening exchanges, on a strangely sandy and uneven surface. The underdogs' crisp passing, movement and superior running power manufactured several promising attacks. Nashville SC forward Jacob Shaffelburg might have done better with shooting opportunities on two occasions within the first 10 minutes.\n\nArgentina, by comparison, were less energetic and ponderous in possession. Messi fired just wide from 18 yards for his team's only effort on goal during the opening forays.\n\nSo, it was out of not-a-lot that Argentina took the lead on 22 minutes through \u00c1lvarez. The Manchester City forward latched on to Rodrigo De Paul's through-ball and evaded the desperate challenge of Mo\u00efse Bombito before scraping the ball through the legs of Maxime Cr\u00e9peau, Canada's shootout hero in the quarters.\n\nThe goal subdued the Canadians' confident and fast-paced start. Their high intensity pressing evaporated in the minutes before half-time on a sweaty New Jersey evening, yet the prolific Jonathan David might have restored parity in first-half stoppage time after a poked effort from a long throw was blocked by Mart\u00ednez.\n\nArgentina started the second period assertively and they were quickly rewarded when Messi got the slightest of touches to divert Fern\u00e1ndez's effort past Cr\u00e9peau in the 51st minute. It was his 14th goal in 38 Copa Am\u00e9rica games and 109th in 186 caps for the national side. Messi looked brighter and fitter than in the quarter-final, when he had only 32 touches (his fewest since 2011 in a full competitive game for Argentina, per Opta) and also missed in the shootout.\n\nSurprisingly, he also completed the full 90 minutes, which allayed fears about the adductor injury that saw him rested for the group stage game in Miami against Peru. While Messi stayed on to the delight of the fans in attendance, another Argentina great, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, was withdrawn, safe in the knowledge his last game before retiring from international football will be Sunday's final.\n\nCanada continued to chase the game gallantly, even when star player Alphonso Davies was forced to depart with an apparent injury with 20 minutes left. Tani Oluwaseyi could have scored twice in two minutes in the match's final stages, but squandered both opportunities; first shooting too close to Mart\u00ednez and then heading wide with the goal gaping.\n\nThe defeat ended Canada's impressive progress at the tournament - although they'll play for third place on Saturday night. When these two sides met in the tournament opener - a comfortable, if imperfect 2-0 win for Argentina last month - few envisioned a semi-final rematch.\n\nHowever, Canada proved themselves to be the class of Concacaf by recovering to progress past Chile and Peru in the group before earning a last-four berth via a shootout win over Venezuela.\n\nIt was a testament to the rapid progress under American coach Marsch, who led Canada into a major tournament semi-final in just his seventh game in charge.\n\nThis week, Marsch recalled attending Italy's semi-final win at the same location during the 1994 World Cup at a time when he was firing in the goals 50 miles away for Princeton University.\n\nUS Soccer officials, amid their messy coaching quagmire and just two years from co-hosting the World Cup in 2026, might have watched Canada's progress at this tournament, with a less capable squad, and wondered \"what if?\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Argentine superstar recently surpassed Ali Daei to become the second all-time top scorer in men's international football, reported by B/R Football. With this achievement, Messi is now chasing his eternal rival, Cristiano Ronaldo, who holds the top spot. This milestone has reignited the heated debate among football fans about who truly deserves the title of the greatest of all time (GOAT).\n\nIn a recent international match, Messi added another goal to his impressive tally, moving past Iranian legend Ali Daei. This goal placed him second on the all-time international goal-scoring list, a significant achievement in the world of football. Messi's consistent performance at the international level continues to solidify his place among the greatest players in the sport's history.\n\nThe ongoing GOAT debate\n\nWith Messi now sitting just behind Ronaldo in the international scoring charts, fans and pundits have once again started debating who deserves the GOAT title. On social media, the arguments are as passionate as ever. One fan, h'bozz, commented, \"This two goat gimmick might be the most cringe thing we've seen, we all know if you swapped Messi's accolades with Ronaldo's they wouldn't keep the same energy. There is only one GOAT.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Ronaldo supporters, like Freddy, congratulated Messi but took a playful dig, saying, \"Congrats. 21 to go :)\" This reflects the rivalry's light-hearted yet competitive nature, with each camp supporting their favorite with equal fervor.\n\nLionel Messi's edge\n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of Messi revolves around the quality and significance of his trophies compared to Ronaldo's. Messi's fans argue that his achievements, including multiple Ballon d'Or awards, Champions League titles, and a Copa America win, make his case stronger. They believe that while Ronaldo may have more goals, Messi's overall contribution to the game is unparalleled.\n\nCritics of Messi, however, point to moments like his recent goal, where some claimed he \"robbed\" Enzo Fernandez of a goal. One detractor stated, \"Messi robbing Enzo goal. He can't be my goat never.\" Such incidents fuel the ongoing debate, with each side finding reasons to elevate their preferred player while downplaying the other.\n\nDespite the intense debates, there is a consensus that both Messi and Ronaldo are in a league of their own. Their dominance in the sport is unmatched, and they have set records that may stand for decades. Whether it's Messi's magical dribbling and playmaking or Ronaldo's incredible athleticism and goal-scoring prowess, both players have brought unparalleled excitement to football fans worldwide.\n\nThe rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo has transcended individual accolades and statistics. It's a clash of styles, personalities, and legacies that has captivated the football world for over a decade. Each milestone one player reaches adds another chapter to this fascinating story.\n\nLooking ahead for Lionel Messi\n\nAs Messi continues to chase Ronaldo's goal-scoring record, the football world will be watching closely. Every match, every goal, and every performance will be scrutinized and compared. This rivalry has defined an era in football, and fans will continue to debate the GOAT question long after both players have retired.\n\nIn the end, whether you are Team Messi or Team Ronaldo, there is no denying the impact both players have had on the sport. They have pushed each other to new heights, inspired millions of fans, and created memories that will last a lifetime. As the debate rages on, one thing is certain: we are witnessing the careers of two of the greatest footballers ever to play the game.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Daei", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ali Daei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichichi_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pichichi Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lionel-Messis-latest-feat-sparks-another-round-of-wild-Cristiano-Ronaldo-debate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720117", "eventUri": "eng-9720117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Did a friend recommend or forward this to you? If so, subscribe here. Have feedback? Leave your questions, comments and concerns through this brief reader survey! Now, here's Mike Sykes.\n\nGoooood morning, folks! Welcome back to the Morning Win. Thanks so much for rocking with us today. We appreciate you giving us a bit of your time.\n\nWe're partying like it's 2008 again, apparently.\n\nNovak Djokovic came into Wimbledon playing on a torn meniscus. The prevailing thought was, \"Man, it's nice to see him out there, isn't it?\" Now it's, \"Hey, uh, can he actually win this thing?\" Day after day the answer seems to keep gravitating toward yes.\n\nDjokovic just advanced to a record-tying 13th semifinal at the tournament after Alex de Minaur withdrew due to a hip injury. Djokovic gets a breezy advance to the final four.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the bracket, Jannik Sinner lost to Daniil Medvedev in five sets on Tuesday, eliminating the world's No. 1 player from the tournament. But now, after just getting by Sinner, Medvedev will have to play Carlos Alcaraz -- the world's No. 3 player. The bracket couldn't have broken any worse for him.\n\nOr, rather, it couldn't have broken any better for Djokovic, who will see either Taylor Fritz (No. 13) or Italy's Lorenzo Musetti (No. 25) in his semifinal matchup. No opponent should be overlooked -- especially with how Fritz has been playing lately. But there's no question that this is an easier path for Djokovic, who almost didn't even play in this tournament because of his knee.\n\nWe're a long way away from Djokovic winning it all here, but if he does? It'd be one of the greatest accomplishments of his already illustrious career. He's already shattered the career Grand Slams mark. Him doing the impossible here would just be another feature in his GOAT cap.\n\nHate him or love him, this dude is great. There's no denying that.\n\nMessi and Argentina make the Copa Finals\n\nSpeaking of no denying, Lionel Messi and Argentina have landed a spot in the Copa Am\u00e9rica Finals after a 2-0 win against Canada. The Cinderella story is over courtesy of the GOAT.\n\nMessi scored in the 50th minute of this match, putting to bed any questions about a miracle comeback for Canada in the late minutes of the game. It also happened to be Messi's first goal in the tournament and might be the last ever in his Copa career.\n\nHere's Cory Woodroof with more:\n\n\"As Argentina faced off in the semifinals against a red-hot Canada team, Messi found the perfect lane to boot the ball in from a fair distance from the net.\n\nIt's Messi's first goal in the tournament, making this yet another edition of the Copa Am\u00e9rica where one of the greatest soccer players of all time registered a goal.\n\nWhile we're not sure if this is Messi's last run with Argentina in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, we're sure this excellent goal to give the team a 2-0 lead will be a special one for Messi and Argentina fans.\"\n\nArgentina will see a tough side in the final, with either Uruguay or Colombia advancing. But if they win the final, they'll have won two back-to-back Copa titles with a World Cup sandwiched in between. That'd be an incredible feat with Messi steering the ship the entire way.\n\nDid I mention the old men were running things again?\n\nOceans 11, but make it sports\n\nThis might be the wildest story you read today. Three guys pulled off a not-so-elaborate heist of $2 million in memorabilia from a stand run by Legacy Cardz at a sports card expo in Dallas.\n\nLegacy's owner, Ashish Jain, published footage of the caper. The three guys in hats distract his staff while a guy in blue snatches the briefcase.\n\nThe thieves knew precisely which briefcase to snatch. There were reportedly 170 cards inside, per The Athletic, including six 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle cards and two 1948 Leaf Jackie Robinson.\n\nThis is wild. It almost feels like something you'd see in a movie -- like all the Ocean's movies, except for its sports instead of casinos.\n\nThere's a $70,000 reward for information on the theft out there.\n\nQuick hits: A list of things older than Lamine Yamal ... WNBA Power Rankings ... and more\n\n-- Lamine Yamal is an absolute star already ... but he's just 16 years old! Here's Robert Zeglinski with a list of things that are older than him.\n\n-- Meg Hall has her latest WNBA Power Rankings out for you with Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese absolutely hooping.\n\n-- Here's Meg again with the heartwarming moment that Jayson Tatum and A'ja Wilson discovered they were cover athletes for NBA 2k25.\n\n-- Rece Hinds is giving us absolute MOON SHOTS with the baseball bat.

He is the one with the goals in the finals, the one that broke the wall, the one that deserves all kinds of recognition. One of the greatest to wear our shirt. For me it has been an enormous pride to walk this path alongside him, to have won titles. Hopefully we can crown Fide in this Copa America final. We will try one more time. There are very few players who have the power to decide when the end is. It makes me very happy that he decided it.\"\n\n\"He has earned that decision-making power. He will no doubt have thought about it a lot, talked about it a lot with his family. A lot of moments have come and gone. It's better for him to leave like this. I've enjoyed it from the first day. In this Copa we touch on the topic very little. We decided to enjoy ourselves and laugh. He knows that we love him and want him to be eternal. But it is a very personal decision. And whatever he decided would be fine.\"\n\nMessi himself was less certain on what exactly he had said before the match, but gave the general jist.\n\n\"I don't remember to be honest... They are words that come out of you, that we feel. I don't remember exactly what I said.

Mexico didn't advance because of one goal and they played well.\n\n\"It seems to me that (CONCACAF) teams are also high quality, and not less significant than teams from South America. I believe it's all pretty even, and the same with Costa Rica. We played friendly against them and at the time it was difficult.\"\n\n\"I believe that (CONCACAF) sides were good in this tournament,\" Scaloni said. \"I'd say at the same level as South American teams.

That someone turned out to be Lionel Scaloni, Argentina's Copa America and World Cup-winning manager.\n\n\"I don't think it's more difficult from one competition to another,\" Scaloni opined. \"There are some important teams that have advanced to the semi-finals of the Euros, teams that we faced in the World Cup, and it went well for us.\n\n\"But that doesn't mean that we could go to the European Championship and win it. Or, maybe, yes (Argentina could win it),\" he continued. \"I think the level is very even. I would like a European team to one day be invited to a Copa America to see what it is like to play in it -- and the opposite, as well.\"\n\nWell, how about it?\n\nFirst, a South American side participating in the European Championship would be extremely unlikely. The difficulty of European nations qualifying for the tournament shouldn't be underestimated -- even with a 24-team final competition, you have nations with memorable recent Euros performances, for example 2004 winners Greece or 2016 semi-finalists Wales, or teams with genuine star players, such as Norway (Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard) and Sweden (Alexander Isak), unable to make it. On a basic mathematical basis, there would be no incentive for smaller UEFA nations to accept the introduction of an outsider.\n\nBut a European nation participating in the Copa America is more viable -- and the idea has been floated before.\n\nWhile the current Copa America, and its 2016 edition, includes six guest sides from the CONCACAF region (North and Central America and the Caribbean) to take it up to a neat 16-team tournament, usually the 10 CONMEBOL (South American) nations need to find two others to create a field of 12. These have most regularly also been the CONCACAF nations -- Mexico, Costa Rica, the United States, Jamaica, Panama, Haiti and Honduras have participated in the past -- but Japan have appeared twice, in 1999 and 2019. In the latter, they were joined by fellow Asian guests Qatar, who were desperately trying to test themselves in a competitive setting ahead of the World Cup they were hosting three years later.\n\nJapan were also supposed to play in the 2011 edition in Argentina but withdrew following the Tohoku earthquake that March when almost 20,000 people died. Their replacements were, eventually, Costa Rica. But CONMEBOL's first idea for a team to fill the gap was more interesting: Spain, then the European and world champions.\n\n\"The RFEF's (the Spanish football federation) board appreciated the invitation made by the president of CONMEBOL, Nicolas Leoz, to participate in the Copa America, but have declined because of calendar problems,\" read a statement by Spain. \"This isn't the first time Spain have received an invitation to play in the Copa America, but the dates and the tight competition calendar have always made it impossible to participate. The board do not rule out the possibility of accepting a future invitation.\"\n\nThat final line was intriguing.\n\nThere has, in recent years, been closer cooperation between UEFA and CONMEBOL.\n\nIn 2020, the two confederations signed a 'memorandum of understanding', which in practical terms has meant, for example, the re-introduction of the little-played 'Finalissima', a match between the winners of the previous European Championship and Copa America.\n\nThis hadn't been held since 1993 (which was its first playing since the inaugural game in 1985) but was staged at London's Wembley Stadium in June 2022, with Argentina running out 3-0 winners against Italy. The women's version took place at the same venue a year later, with England triumphing against Brazil on penalties following a 1-1 draw.\n\nWe've had the UEFA-CONMEBOL Club Challenge, essentially a Supercup game played between the winners of the Europa League and its equivalent, the Copa Sudamericana. Sevilla of Spain defeated Ecuadorian visitors Independiente del Valle on penalties last summer, also after a 1-1 draw.\n\nThere has also been an agreement to mutually recognise equivalent coaching licenses, for referees to participate in 'exchanges' (an Argentine officiating team took charge of two games in this summer's Euros) -- and, intriguingly in the context of Scaloni's comments at the top of this article, a suggestion South American sides might compete in future editions of the UEFA Nations League.\n\nNotably, both confederations oppose FIFA's suggestion that World Cups should be played every two years rather than the long-established four. Other regional confederations, less concerned by player burnout and more in need of revenue, are keener on the idea.\n\nA potential solution would be the introduction of a tournament that involves sides from the four other worldwide regions -- Africa, Asia, North/Central America and the Caribbean, and Oceania -- who haven't made as much progress at World Cup level over the first quarter of this century as had been hoped.\n\nThat, really, is the issue world football should be focused on.\n\nFor all the sporadic applause for sides from other regions 'catching up' with the elite, the sad reality is that the nine current bookmakers' favourites for World Cup 2026 are the same nine as for the 2006 edition: the usual big seven from Europe -- England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain -- plus the big two from South America, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nThe only other countries that have muscled their way into that kind of status over the past two decades have been Belgium and Uruguay, one more each from those same two regions.\n\nAt various points, change has felt imminent.\n\nThe USMNT made progress in the first decade of the century but stalled. Mexico looked a seriously good side in 2010 and 2014 but have gone backwards. Japan and South Korea seemed on the rise at roughly that same time, having co-hosted the 2002 World Cup, but, along with Australia (formerly of Oceania, now Asian for football purposes), in hindsight simply produced a golden generation rather than anything more substantial.\n\nAfrican sides have been considered the coming force since the 1990s, but while Morocco reaching the semi-finals of the most recent World Cup broke new ground, it can't be ignored that their team in Qatar largely consisted of European-born players, which isn't a viable route to long-term progress for most other nations.\n\nTherefore, the last thing football needs is Europe and South America inviting one another to join their tournaments, ignoring the other regions and effectively pulling up the drawbridge.\n\nOther confederations are already concerned that the UEFA Nations League, for example, means the top European sides are less likely to play friendlies against sides from other continents and progress has become difficult. The participation of South American teams in that competition would effectively make it a Super League and have many of the negative effects of that concept.\n\nUltimately, the only comparisons we need between European and South American sides come every four years at the World Cup, and also in the Finalissima. Experimentation shouldn't be discouraged for the sake of it.\n\nThe two dominant confederations have no particular responsibility to help others grow, but UEFA and CONMEBOL reaching out to nations from other continents would be better for world football.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_cox@nytimes.com", "name": "Michael Cox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA_Cup_of_Champions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Leoz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Leoz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFL-Supercup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DFL-Supercup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Sudamericana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Sudamericana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.S.D._Independiente_del_Valle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C.S.D.

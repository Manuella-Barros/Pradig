Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main reason Berkshire's cash hoard soared. Buffett said cash might grow to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks he sees from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite reducing the Apple stake, Buffett praised the company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest and largest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple comprised too much of Berkshire's equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain his company's biggest stock investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020. He described it as a substantial challenge and said many claims were unfounded.\n\nShareholders reelected all 14 Berkshire directors and rejected six shareholder proposals, all of which Buffett opposed.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including scenes of Omaha from 1924, when he was born, and clips of Buffett and Munger over the years.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up in raw, rainy weather to enter the arena, sometimes several hours in advance. When the doors opened at 7 a.m., many ran for the best seats.\n\nThe weekend also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nSerena Lam, 32, an investment manager who traveled with 40 others from Hong Kong, said she arrived at 2:30 a.m.\n\n\"I want to see Warren Buffett,\" she said. \"I want to get his perspective on Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAs usual, Buffett interspersed comments on Berkshire's portfolio with musings about wealth and life, including his own.\n\n\"I enjoy managing money for the people who trust me. I like the feeling of being trusted,\" he said. \"If I'm lucky, I can go on for six or seven years, or it might end tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Buffett described Munger, his longtime his friend and foil, as the \"architect of today's Berkshire.\"\n\nDecreasing Apple stake, growing cash\n\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion.\n\nIn a surprise, Berkshire reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main reason Berkshire's cash hoard soared. Buffett said cash might grow to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks he sees from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite reducing the Apple stake, Buffett praised the company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest and largest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple comprised too much of Berkshire's equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain his company's biggest stock investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020. He described it as a substantial challenge, and said many claims were unfounded.\n\nShareholders reelected all 14 Berkshire directors, and rejected six shareholder proposals, all of which Buffett opposed.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including scenes of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and clips of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard &Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nLines formed hours before meeting\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up in raw, rainy weather to enter the arena, sometimes several hours in advance.

Buffett described Munger, his longtime his friend and foil, as the \"architect of today's Berkshire.\"\n\nBuffett gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nDECREASING APPLE STAKE, GROWING CASH\n\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion.\n\nIn a surprise, Berkshire reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL), reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main reason Berkshire's cash hoard soared. Buffett said cash might grow to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks he sees from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite reducing the Apple stake, Buffett praised the company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest and largest investments, American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple comprised too much of Berkshire's equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain his company's biggest stock investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020. He described it as a substantial challenge, and said many claims were unfounded.\n\nShareholders reelected all 14 Berkshire directors, and rejected six shareholder proposals, all of which Buffett opposed.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including scenes of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and clips of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nLINES FORMED HOURS BEFORE MEETING\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up in raw, rainy weather to enter the arena, sometimes several hours in advance. When the doors opened at 7 a.m., many ran for the best seats.\n\nThe weekend also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nSerena Lam, 32, an investment manager who traveled with 40 others from Hong Kong, said she arrived at 2:30 a.m.\n\n\"I want to see Warren Buffett,\" she said. \"I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAs usual, Buffett interspersed comments on Berkshire's portfolio with musings about wealth and life, including his own.\n\n\"I enjoy managing money for the people who trust me. I like the feeling of being trusted,\" he said. \"If I'm lucky, I can go on for six or seven years, or it might end tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Buffett described Munger, his longtime friend and foil, as the \"architect of today's Berkshire\".\n\nBuffett gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nApple shares\n\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2bn.\n\nIn a surprise, Berkshire reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4bn from $174.3bn. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main reason Berkshire's cash hoard soared. Buffett said cash might grow to $200bn this quarter, reflecting the risks he sees from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite reducing the Apple stake, Buffett praised the company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest and largest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time\", Buffett said with Apple CEO Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple comprised too much of Berkshire's equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain his company's biggest stock investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollar from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020. He described it as a substantial challenge, and said many claims were unfounded.\n\nShareholders reelected all 14 Berkshire directors, and rejected six shareholder proposals, all of which Buffett opposed.\n\nLaconic comebacks\n\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including scenes of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and clips of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the past decade vs the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up in rainy weather to enter the arena, sometimes several hours in advance. When the doors opened at 7am, many ran for the best seats.\n\nThe weekend also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nSerena Lam, 32, an investment manager who travelled with 40 others from Hong Kong, said she arrived at 2.30am.\n\n\"I want to see Warren Buffett,\" she said. \"I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew more than 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAs usual, Buffett interspersed comments on Berkshire's portfolio with musings about wealth and life, including his own.\n\n\"I enjoy managing money for the people who trust me. I like the feeling of being trusted,\" he said. \"If I'm lucky, I can go on for six or seven years, or it might end tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title":

Our special coverage will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nJazwares, the American toymaker best known for its Squishmallows plushie line, was a hit last year when it first displayed its wares at Berkshire Hathaway's conference, including the debut of a Warren Buffett plushie. This year, the company expanded its exhibit in the convention hall, making it three times larger.\n\nSome highlights include the latest Squishmallows toys for Buffett and Charlie Munger, a splashy Squishmallows pit, as well as other displays.\n\nThe Bookworm only had one book to sell this year: \"Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Essential Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger.\" That was at the request of Buffett in honor of his business partner of more than 60 years, who passed away in November at the age of 99.\n\nBerkshire acquired pilot training company FlightSafety in 1996. At Friday's shopping event, the firm brought a taste of what its training program looks like for professional pilots. Shareholders lined up to put on virtual reality glasses and experience the flight simulation training.\n\nTruck-stop giant Pilot Travel Centers put up a big display with a real-sized red truck. The firm is largest operator of travel centers in North America, with more than 750 locations. Berkshire now fully owns Pilot Travel after buying the remaining 20% ownership interest from the Haslam family. The deal was not without drama as the Haslams last year sued Berkshire in a complaint that accused the conglomerate of using so-called pushdown accounting without authorization from the family.\n\nIn 2016, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought Duracell from Procter & Gamble, offering the consumer giant $4.7 billion of the shares it owned in P&G in exchange for the battery maker.\n\nBrooks Running attracted a long line of shareholders snapping up the 2024 special edition of its running shoes with \"brk\" on the side and a cartoon of a running Buffett on the insoles. Many shareholders are also set to participate in the Brooks \"Invest in Yourself\" 5K fun run and walk on Sunday, the morning following the annual meeting.\n\nWarren Buffett bought Dairy Queen in 1998 in a roughly $600 million transaction, and has made trips to the Omaha locations with his great-grandchildren. According to The Wall Street Journal, the billionaire investor has said in the past that his favorite DQ order is a vanilla soft serve topped with chocolate syrup and malted milk power.", "source":

Buffett described Munger, his longtime his friend and foil, as the \"architect of today's Berkshire.\"\n\nBuffett gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nDECREASING APPLE STAKE, GROWING CASH\n\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion.\n\nIn a surprise, Berkshire reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main reason Berkshire's cash hoard soared. Buffett said cash might grow to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks he sees from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite reducing the Apple stake, Buffett praised the company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest and largest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple comprised too much of Berkshire's equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain his company's biggest stock investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020. He described it as a substantial challenge, and said many claims were unfounded.\n\nShareholders reelected all 14 Berkshire directors, and rejected six shareholder proposals, all of which Buffett opposed.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including scenes of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and clips of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nLINES FORMED HOURS BEFORE MEETING\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up in raw, rainy weather to enter the arena, sometimes several hours in advance. When the doors opened at 7 a.m., many ran for the best seats.\n\nThe weekend also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nSerena Lam, 32, an investment manager who traveled with 40 others from Hong Kong, said she arrived at 2:30 a.m.\n\n\"I want to see Warren Buffett,\" she said. \"I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAs usual, Buffett interspersed comments on Berkshire's portfolio with musings about wealth and life, including his own.\n\n\"I enjoy managing money for the people who trust me. I like the feeling of being trusted,\" he said. \"If I'm lucky, I can go on for six or seven years, or it might end tomorrow.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha; additional

It was also the first since Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nIn a downtown Omaha arena, Buffett was joined on stage by Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, who was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, and Ajit Jain.\n\nAbel, 61, and Jain, 72 have had direct oversight of Berkshire's dozens of operating subsidiaries since 2018, freeing Buffett and, before his death, Munger to focus on capital allocation. Buffett said he was happy with that arrangement.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" he said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nBuffett, 93, gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion.\n\nDECREASING APPLE STAKE, GROWING CASH\n\nIn a surprise move, the conglomerate also reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main cause for Berkshire's cash hoard to soar. Buffett said cash might grow from $189 billion last quarter to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite decreasing Berkshire's stake in Apple, Buffett praised the tech company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple represented too much of Berkshire's now $335.9 billion equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain the company's biggest investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nBuffett added that he expects the U.S. government to increase taxes to tackle a widening fiscal deficit rather than reduce spending.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020, but called them a substantial challenge.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including photos of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and clips of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nHe was the \"architect of today's Berkshire,\" Buffett said.\n\nEARLY WAKE-UP\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up early outside the arena in raw, rainy weather. When the doors opened at 7 a.m., many ran for the best seats.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, said he arrived at 1:41 a.m. to get in line, with a lawn chair to sit and sleep on.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire,\" he said. \"They're so diversified and have a good company culture.\"\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nThe shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment manager who along with 40 others flew from Hong Kong. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan and Davide Barbuscia; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia

REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing\n\nOMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett paid tribute to his late business partner Charlie Munger at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, while reassuring shareholders that the executives expected to succeed him were ready for the job.\n\nBuffett, legendary for his investing acumen, also praised Apple after unexpectedly revealing that Berkshire had reduced its stake in the iPhone maker. He said the company was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola\n\nThe meeting was the 60th for Buffett, who took over Berkshire in 1965 and turned it into an expansive company valued at a $862 billion owning BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and other businesses. Saturday's meeting was the first since Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nBuffett, 93, signaled no plans to step aside himself, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nEarly in the meeting, shareholders watched a video paying to tribute to Munger, including photos of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and video of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger was the \"architect of today's Berkshire,\" Buffett said. \"The architect is the person who dreams of and designs, and finally supervises the construction of great structures. The carpenters and the beavers -- that's me -- are needed, but the architect is the genius of Berkshire.\"\n\nIn a downtown Omaha arena, Buffett was joined on stage by Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, who was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, and Ajit Jain.\n\nAbel, 61, and Jain, 72 have had direct oversight of Berkshire's dozens of operating subsidiaries since 2018, freeing Buffett and, before his death, Munger to focus on capital allocation. Buffett said he was happy with that arrangement.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" he said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nDECREASING APPLE STAKE, GROWING CASH\n\nPrior to the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion.\n\nBut in a surprise, Berkshire reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main cause for Berkshire's cash hoard to soar to $189 billion, also a record. Buffett said cash might grow to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nBut some investors expressed concern that Apple represented too much of Berkshire's now $335.9 billion equity portfolio.\n\nStill, with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience, Buffett told Berkshire shareholders: \"Unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nAnd he said Berkshire remains committed to investing in the United States. \"If we do something really big it's extremely likely it will be in the United States,\" he said.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020, but called them a substantial challenge.\n\nEARLY WAKE-UP\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up early outside the arena in raw, rainy weather. When the doors opened at 7 a.m., many ran for the best seats.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment manager who along with 40 others flew from Hong Kong. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, said he arrived at 1:41 a.m. to get in line, with a lawn chair to sit and sleep on.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire,\" he said. \"They're so diversified and have a good company culture.\"\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nThe shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A Buffett, admirer, she became a Berkshire shareholder 15 years ago.\n\n\"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan and Davide Barbuscia; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia Osterman, Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

It was also the first since Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nIn a downtown Omaha arena, Buffett was joined on stage by Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, who was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, and Ajit Jain.\n\nAbel, 61, and Jain, 72 have had direct oversight of Berkshire's dozens of operating subsidiaries since 2018, freeing Buffett and, before his death, Munger to focus on capital allocation. Buffett said he was happy with that arrangement.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" he said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nBuffett, 93, gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion.\n\nDECREASING APPLE STAKE, GROWING CASH\n\nIn a surprise move, the conglomerate also reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main cause for Berkshire's cash hoard to soar. Buffett said cash might grow from $189 billion last quarter to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite decreasing Berkshire's stake in Apple, Buffett praised the tech company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple represented too much of Berkshire's now $335.9 billion equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain the company's biggest investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nBuffett added that he expects the U.S. government to increase taxes to tackle a widening fiscal deficit rather than reduce spending.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020, but called them a substantial challenge.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including photos of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and clips of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nHe was the \"architect of today's Berkshire,\" Buffett said.\n\nEARLY WAKE-UP\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up early outside the arena in raw, rainy weather. When the doors opened at 7 a.m., many ran for the best seats.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, said he arrived at 1:41 a.m. to get in line, with a lawn chair to sit and sleep on.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire,\" he said. \"They're so diversified and have a good company culture.\"\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nThe shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment manager who along with 40 others flew from Hong Kong. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\" (Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan and Davide Barbuscia; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia Osterman, Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n\nMilestone Alert!

REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing\n\nOMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) -Warren Buffett took the stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, paying tribute to his longtime business partner Charlie Munger while outlining the expanded roles of the executives who are designated to eventually succeed him in leading the company.\n\nThe meeting is the 60th for Buffett, 93, since he took over Berkshire in 1965. He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nBuffett said he was comfortable letting chief executives of Berkshire's operating units deal directly with Vice Chairman Greg Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain. Abel, 61, designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, sat on stage with Buffett.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" he said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\n\"I have been in the position of having people I trust around me,\" said Buffett on stage, who then referenced Munger. Earlier, in a video ahead of the meeting, Berkshire played a tribute to Munger showing photos of Omaha from 1924 and footage of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"Charlie's architectural thoughts led to the Berkshire Hathaway of today,\" said Buffett on the video. His design, he said, \"lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\nStill, Buffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nBuffett also said he didn't mind expanding the company's cash stake, with comparatively few alternatives in the equity markets and conflicts around the world, and said cash could top $200 billion by the end of June.\n\nHe added that Berkshire remains committed to the U.S.\n\n\"We will be American oriented,\" Buffett said. \"If we do something really big it's extremely likely it will be in the United States.\"\n\nBuffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens\" that really changes Berkshire's capital allocation, it will have Apple as its largest investment.\n\nAbel addressed issues at Berkshire's energy business, saying Berkshire will fight litigation related to wildfires but that it was a substantial challenge. The unit faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND Berkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. Berkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six. The weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession. \"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan and Davide Barbuscia; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia Osterman, Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nBuffett said he was comfortable letting chief executives of Berkshire's operating units deal directly with Vice Chairman Greg Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain. Abel, 61, designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, sat on stage with Buffett.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" he said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\" The shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\n\"I have been in the position of having people I trust around me,\" said Buffett on stage, who then referenced Munger. Earlier, in a video ahead of the meeting, Berkshire played a tribute to Munger showing photos of Omaha from 1924 and footage of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"Charlie's architectural thoughts led to the Berkshire Hathaway of today,\" said Buffett on the video. His design, he said, \"lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\nStill, Buffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nBuffett also said he didn't mind expanding the company's cash stake, with comparatively few alternatives in the equity markets and conflicts around the world, and said cash could top $200 billion by the end of June.\n\nHe added that Berkshire remains committed to the U.S.\n\n\"We will be American oriented,\" Buffett said. \"If we do something really big it's extremely likely it will be in the United States.\"\n\nBuffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens\" that really changes Berkshire's capital allocation, it will have Apple as its largest investment.\n\nAbel addressed issues at Berkshire's energy business, saying Berkshire will fight litigation related to wildfires but that it was a substantial challenge. The unit faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND\n\nBerkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company.\n\nBerkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six.\n\nThe weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession.\n\n\"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\nMilestone Alert!

It was also the first since Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nIn a downtown Omaha arena, Buffett was joined on stage by Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, who was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, and Ajit Jain.\n\nAbel, 61, and Jain, 72 have had direct oversight of Berkshire's dozens of operating subsidiaries since 2018, freeing Buffett and, before his death, Munger to focus on capital allocation. Buffett said he was happy with that arrangement.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" he said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nBuffett, 93, gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion.\n\nDECREASING APPLE STAKE, GROWING CASH\n\nIn a surprise move, the conglomerate also reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main cause for Berkshire's cash hoard to soar. Buffett said cash might grow from $189 billion last quarter to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite decreasing Berkshire's stake in Apple, Buffett praised the tech company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple represented too much of Berkshire's now $335.9 billion equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain the company's biggest investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nBuffett added that he expects the U.S. government to increase taxes to tackle a widening fiscal deficit rather than reduce spending.\n\nAbel, meanwhile, pledged to fight lawsuits seeking tens of billions of dollars from Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020, but called them a substantial challenge.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, shareholders watched a video tribute to Munger, including photos of Omaha from 1924 when he was born and clips of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger had been a fixture on stage with Buffett at the meetings, known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's musings about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\nHe was the \"architect of today's Berkshire,\" Buffett said.\n\nEARLY WAKE-UP\n\nBefore the meeting, thousands lined up early outside the arena in raw, rainy weather. When the doors opened at 7 a.m., many ran for the best seats.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, said he arrived at 1:41 a.m. to get in line, with a lawn chair to sit and sleep on.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire,\" he said. \"They're so diversified and have a good company culture.\"\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year. While that lags the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain, Berkshire has risen 218% over the last decade versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nThe shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" also featured an exhibit hall for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits by Berkshire-owned companies.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment manager who along with 40 others flew from Hong Kong. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks.

Shareholders eagerly awaited insights on Berkshire's future direction and succession plan.Warren Buffett took the stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, paying tribute to his longtime business partner Charlie Munger who died last year and outlining Berkshire's goal to grow earnings.\n\nThe meeting is the 60th for Buffett, 93, since he took over Berkshire in 1965. He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99. In a video ahead of the meeting, Berkshire played a tribute to Charlie Munger showing photos of Omaha from 1924 and footage of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"Charlie's architectural thoughts led to the Berkshire Hathaway of today,\" said Buffett on the video. His design, he said, \"lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\n\"The goal of Berkshire... is to increase the operating earnings,\" Buffett said as he kicked off the meeting with a run-down of the first quarter's earnings.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND\n\nBerkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company.\n\n\"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\"\n\nBerkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six.\n\nThe weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession.\n\n\"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Track all of the day's news and analysis here.\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting Saturday will be broadcast exclusively on CNBC and livestreamed on CNBC.com. The special coverage will begin at 9:30 a.m. ET and all the day's events will be chronicled here.\n\nChairman and CEO Warren Buffett is expected to field questions from Berkshire Hathaway shareholders who are attending the meeting in Omaha, beginning at 10:15 a.m. ET.\n\nThe event is always closely watched, but this year's will be noteworthy because Buffett won't have Charlie Munger by his side. The investing legend died on Nov. 28, 2024, just weeks before what would have been his 100th birthday. Munger, the former vice chairman of Berkshire, was known for his sharp wit, and his absence is being felt by the thousands attending the event.\n\nAmong the questions that will be top of mind at the \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" will be what Buffett's mystery holding is. The firm was granted confidential treatment for an investment in past quarters, and it remains to be seen if that will continue or if Buffett will share more information at this weekend's gathering.\n\nCFRA is bullish on B shares of Berkshire Hathaway ahead of the company's annual meeting.\n\nThe firm called the stock \"undervalued versus historical averages\" and anticipates catalysts in the Berkshire Hathaway's earnings release Saturday morning.\n\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway are up nearly 13% year to date.\n\nTo read more about CFRA's call and what it expects from CEO Warren Buffett during the so-called \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" read the full story here.\n\n-- Michelle Fox\n\nThere's a chance that Buffett will reveal the mystery wager Berkshire has been buying for two quarters straight.\n\nIn the third and fourth quarters of 2023, Berkshire was granted confidential treatment to keep the details of one or more of its stock holdings confidential.\n\nMany speculated that the secret purchase could be a bank stock as the conglomerate's cost basis for \"banks, insurance, and finance\" equity holdings jumped by $3.59 billion in the second half of last year, according to separate Berkshire filings.\n\nIt's relatively rare for Berkshire to request such a treatment. The last time it kept a purchase confidential was when it bought Chevron and Verizon in 2020.\n\n-- Yun Li\n\nThe annual meeting could start on a somber note with the absence of Charlie Munger on everyone's mind.\n\nPandemic lockdown apart, it will be the first without Munger, Buffett's longtime partner who passed away in November at the age of 99.\n\nFor the first time, Berkshire will broadcast its annual meeting movie that had previously always been reserved only for those in attendance in Omaha. Many speculate this year's will be a tear-jerker tribute to Munger.\n\nVice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor, will fill Munger's seat in the afternoon session, helping answer shareholder questions.\n\nMunger left a mark on generations of investors in a host of ways thanks to a long and fruitful life. He broadened Buffett's investing approach to focus on quality companies selling at fair prices.

He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nBuffett said he was comfortable letting chief executives of Berkshire's operating units deal directly with Vice Chairman Greg Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain. Abel, 61, designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, sat on stage with Buffett.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" he said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\n\"I have been in the position of having people I trust around me,\" said Buffett on stage, who then referenced Munger. Earlier, in a video ahead of the meeting, Berkshire played a tribute to Munger showing photos of Omaha from 1924 and footage of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"Charlie's architectural thoughts led to the Berkshire Hathaway of today,\" said Buffett on the video. His design, he said, \"lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\nStill, Buffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nBuffett also said he didn't mind expanding the company's cash stake, with comparatively few alternatives in the equity markets and conflicts around the world, and said cash could top $200 billion by the end of June.\n\nHe added that Berkshire remains committed to the U.S.\n\n\"We will be American oriented,\" Buffett said. \"If we do something really big it's extremely likely it will be in the United States.\"\n\nBuffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens\" that really changes Berkshire's capital allocation, it will have Apple as its largest investment.\n\nAbel addressed issues at Berkshire's energy business, saying Berkshire will fight litigation related to wildfires but that it was a substantial challenge. The unit faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND Berkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. Berkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six. The weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession. \"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan and Davide Barbuscia; editing by Ira

(AP) -- Warren Buffett's company reported a steep drop in earnings Saturday because the paper value of its investments fell, but the tens of thousands of shareholders filling an Omaha arena to hear Buffett answer questions at the annual meeting later can take heart that Berkshire Hathaway's many businesses performed well.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\nTHOUSANDS ATTEND WARREN BUFFETT'S 'WOODSTOCK FOR CAPITALISTS'\n\nThe main arena was already three-quarters full within half an hour of the doors opening Saturday because people are always eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute to Munger recounting his life and highlighting some of his best known quotes from the meetings over the years, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured old interviews with Buffett and Munger talking about their epic friendship.\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99. In a video ahead of the meeting, Berkshire played a tribute to Charlie Munger showing photos of Omaha from 1924 and footage of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"Charlie's architectural thoughts led to the Berkshire Hathaway of today,\" said Buffett on the video. His design, he said, \"lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\n\"The goal of Berkshire... is to increase the operating earnings,\" Buffett said as he kicked off the meeting with a run-down of the first quarter's earnings.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND\n\nBerkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. \"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\" Berkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six. The weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession. \"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan and Davide Barbuscia; editing by Ira

Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO. Abel and Jain are sharing the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year in the spot Munger used to occupy.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" out of habit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nBuffett's company reported a steep drop in earnings because the paper value of its investments fell and it sold off part of its massive Apple stake, but overall, Berkshire Hathaway's many businesses performed well.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion, and Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years -- even up to when his successor takes over.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 5,

For about 5 hours, Buffett took questions on Berkshire's many businesses, investing and life in general.\n\nThe meeting included a video tribute to Buffett's longtime partner and Berkshire vice-chairman Charlie Munger, who died in November at age 99. Shareholders kicked off the gathering with a standing ovation for Munger, who Buffett calls the \"architect of Berkshire.\"\n\nHere are some key takeaways for investors from the meeting.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway annual meeting: Key takeaways for investors\n\n1. Portfolio update\n\nBerkshire's first quarter results revealed that it trimmed its stake in Apple by about 13 percent. The iPhone maker is still the largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and stood at $135.4 billion at the end of March, down from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nBuffett praised Apple's business and said it was very likely it would remain Berkshire's largest stock position at the end of the year and that Berkshire would likely hold it after he's gone.\n\nBuffett also said he sold Berkshire's entire stake in Paramount Global and that he was \"100 percent responsible,\" adding that they had lost \"quite a bit of money.\" Some Berkshire watchers had speculated that the position was held by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, two investment managers who work for Berkshire.\n\n2. Cash pile grows in absence of attractive investment opportunities\n\nBerkshire's massive cash pile grew to more than $182 billion at the end of the first quarter and Buffett said it was fair to assume it would reach $200 billion at the end of the second quarter.\n\n\"I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position,\" Buffett said. \"When I look at the alternatives of what's available in the equity markets and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\"\n\nBerkshire has often held large amounts of cash and been willing to wait until it finds investment opportunities that meet its requirements. Buffett has historically put cash to work during market downturns such as during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\n3. Don't make investment decisions based on taxes\n\nBerkshire has many long-term investments that have seen enormous gains over time such as Coca-Cola, American Express and Apple. Berkshire pays taxes on any dividends it receives from these holdings, but capital gains aren't taxed until shares are sold.\n\nBut Buffett told shareholders that holding an investment just to avoid paying taxes doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n\"Almost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should,\" Buffett said. \"We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire.\"\n\n4. AI could be harmful\n\nBuffett was asked a few times during the meeting about the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the economy and Berkshire. He compared AI to the development of nuclear weapons, saying you can't put the genie back in the bottle.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm,\" Buffett said. \"I just don't know how that plays out.\"\n\nBuffett also warned about the potential for investment scams that use AI to trick people into handing over their money. Scamming is \"going to be the growth industry of all time,\" Buffett warned.\n\nBerkshire's businesses will be able to adapt to the new technology and will use AI to become more efficient, Berkshire vice-chairman Greg Abel told shareholders.\n\n5. Climate change poses risks for investors\n\nThe Berkshire meeting also highlighted the risks that investors face in certain industries from climate change. Berkshire utilities in western states face risks as wildfires become more frequent and regulators and investors grapple with who should bear the costs.\n\nBerkshire's PacifiCorp unit faces billions of dollars in liabilities for its role in Oregon's 2020 wildfires, but Buffett reiterated at the annual meeting that Berkshire would not knowingly \"throw good money after bad.\"\n\nBerkshire's vast insurance operations also face risks from climate change as hurricanes potentially become more frequent, more powerful and take different paths.\n\n\"The amount of activity in terms of storms, both

REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing\n\nOMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett took the stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, paying tribute to his longtime business partner Charlie Munger who died last year and outlining Berkshire's goal to grow earnings.\n\nThe meeting is the 60th for Buffett, 93, since he took over Berkshire in 1965. He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99. In a video ahead of the meeting, Berkshire played a tribute to Charlie Munger showing photos of Omaha from 1924 and footage of Buffett and Munger through the years.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"Charlie's architectural thoughts led to the Berkshire Hathaway of today,\" said Buffett on the video. His design, he said, \"lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\n\"The goal of Berkshire... is to increase the operating earnings,\" Buffett said as he kicked off the meeting with a run-down of the first quarter's earnings.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND\n\nBerkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. \"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\" Berkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six. The weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession. \"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan and Davide Barbuscia; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia Osterman, Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The move quickly became one of the biggest topics as the meeting unfolded, even though Berkshire had sold some shares in Apple during the quarter before.\n\nDespite the sale, Apple is \"even better\" than American Express and Coca-Cola, which are \"wonderful\" businesses Berkshire also owns, Buffett told the crowd of thousands in Omaha. Unless something changes dramatically, Apple will remain its largest investment, he said, hinting that tax implications had motivated the sale. The iPhone may be one of the greatest products of all time, Buffett added.\n\nApple has faced a slew of headwinds -- a $2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project among them. Shares in the company are down about 5% this year.\n\nThe sale bolstered Berkshire's cash pile, which climbed to a record $189 billion at the end of March. Given current market conditions -- where rate cuts are uncertain, inflation remains elevated and geopolitical risks abound -- Buffett said he didn't mind amassing the cash and said it could reach $200 billion by the end of the quarter.\n\nThe cash hoard also benefited from higher interest rates, earning $1.9 billion of interest income compared to $1.1 billion during the same quarter a year prior.\n\nBerkshire's cash pile has grown amid a dearth of sizable deals. Buffett said on Saturday he's been unable to find recent acquisitions that would \"move the needle\" for the firm. Investors took it as a sign of his view on the stock market, too.\n\n\"Buffett is hoarding cash and therefore is bearish on the stock market,\" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management. \"He is unlikely to apply those funds unless he has a chance to buy an entire company or there is a major market sell off of 30% or more.\"\n\nHere are some other key takeaways from Berkshire's annual meeting and earnings:\n\nEarnings Gain\n\nIn a sign the US economy remained robust at the beginning of the year, the conglomerate's collection of businesses - which include manufacturers, home builders, insurance companies and retailers -- generated $11.2 billion of operating earnings, a 39% jump on the prior year.\n\nImproved results at its insurance businesses helped the increase, earning $2.6 billion versus $911 million in the same period last year. At its auto-insurer Geico, pre-tax profits more than doubled to $1.93 billion, reflecting higher average policy premiums and lower claims, Berkshire said in its earnings statement. The business swung to profitability last year following several quarters of consecutive losses.\n\n\"There's still work to be done, but in the meantime, we are not going to shrink,\" Buffett said of Geico.\n\nBerkshire's railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3% decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to \"unfavorable changes in business mix\" as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nClimate, Wildfires\n\nBerkshire's PacifiCorp recorded $2.4 billion of estimated pre-tax probable losses from wildfires that spread across Oregon and California. About $1.7 billion of that remains unpaid, Berkshire said in its earnings report.\n\nPacifiCorp faces liability claims from the blazes, and damages sought by plaintiffs in Oregon and California totaled approximately $7 billion at the end of the first quarter, Berkshire said. At its annual meeting, Greg Abel -- Buffett's appointed successor and vice chairman of Berkshire's non-insurance operations -- pointed to an additional claim for $30 billion that was filed last week, though he described it as \"an incremental claim\" to an existing lawsuit.\n\nThe absence of Charlie Munger, Buffett's long-time business partner who died in November age 99, cast a pall over the meeting, which kicked off with a tribute film featuring a highlight reel of Munger's famously acerbic one-liners.\n\nBuffett said the two had a \"lot of fun doing anything\" -- he referenced golf and tennis -- but they had even more fun \"with things that failed, because then we really had to work, and work our way out of them.\"\n\nAt one point, Buffett mistakenly called Abel \"Charlie\" when he turned to him, and answered a question from a young attendee about what he'd do if he had another day with to spend with Munger. Buffett answered that he would have spent it the same way as other days.\n\n\"He went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99, but the world was interested in him,\" Buffett said of Munger.\n\nSuccession\n\nBuffett referenced his own mortality throughout the day, as the question of succession arose repeatedly. The billionaire investor assured Berkshire's shareholders that the company's future was in good hands. Abel -- who understands businesses \"extremely well\" -- should take over Buffett's capital allocation when he is no longer around, he said.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" Buffett said, referring also to Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chair of insurance operations. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nBuffett also kept invoking leadership changes at Apple, noting the strong leadership of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who took over for Steve Jobs.\n\n\"Buffett made it very clear that the structure of the firm is in place,\" said J. Dennis Jean-Jacques, founder and chief investment officer at Ocean Park Investments who first attended the meeting in 2000. \"It's going to become more important for shareholders to ensure the board of directors and managers keep the structure in tact -- they are smart people and are not afraid to write to the CEO to let them know things are going wayward.\"\n\nParamount Global\n\nBerkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment. The company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is currently the subject of takeover talks.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Buffet fondly remembered Munger as the \"architect of Berkshire\" in his tribute to him, underscoring his significant role in the company's success throughout the years.\n\nAlso Read: Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Q1 operating profit rises 39% to $11.22 billion, net income drops 64% YoY\n\nLet's take a look at the five key highlights from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting\n\nGiving rest to speculations, Warren Buffett said Greg Abel, 61, who will be taking over the CEO job at Berkshire Hathaway, will control Berkshire Hathaway's investing decisions, including its stock portfolio, after him.\n\n\"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg. The responsibility has been with me, and I farmed out some of it, and I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think the responsibility should be that of the CEO,\" said Buffett, as quoted by CNBC.com.\n\nAbdel, vice chairman of the non-insurance operation, whose name was revealed as Buffett's successor at the shareholder meeting in 2021, has been managing a significant portion of Berkshire's investments, including energy and retail.\n\nAlso Read: Warren Buffett accidentally calls Greg Abel 'Charlie Munger'; netizens say 'they were incredibly...'\n\nBerkshire Hathaway trimmed its stake in Apple for the second consecutive quarter as it reduced its investment in tech-giant Apple by around 13 per cent in the first quarter.\n\nBerkshire sold about 10 million shares of Apple, or 1 per cent of its stake in the tech firm, in the last quarter of 2023. Berkshire again sold about 116 million Apple shares, or 13 per cent stake in the company, in the first quarter of the current year.\n\nAlso Read: Buffett reassures succession plans at Berkshire Hathaway; praises Apple despite stake redduction\n\nNevertheless, at the end of the January-March quarter, Apple was Berkshire's biggest holding. Buffett said the stake sale was for tax purposes, and Apple may remain Berkshire's largest holding at the end of the year.\n\nAlso Read: Apple remains Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holding despite 13% stake cut in Q1, current bet worth $135 billion\n\nWarren Buffett believes that artificial intelligence (AI) scamming could be the next big \"growth industry\".\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett highlighted the potential of AI for scamming people due to its ability to create convincing fake images and messages. Scammers could use this technology to trick people into sending money by making fake pleas for help, like pretending to be a family member in trouble.\n\n\"When you think about the potential for scamming people, if you can reproduce images that I can't even tell, that say, 'I need money,' as your daughter, 'I just had a car crash, I need $50,000 wired.' I mean, scamming has always been part of the American scene, but this would make me, if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the growth industry of all time,\" CNBC quoted Buffett saying so.\n\nTaking a 100 per cent ownership of the decision, Buffett said Berkshire sold the entire stake in Paramount Global at a loss.\n\nBerkshire owned 63.3 million shares of Paramount at the end of 2023 after cutting about a third of its stake in the company in Q4 last year.\n\nBuffett appeared positive about India. He said there were \"loads of opportunities in a place like India\". Berkshire, however, does not have immediate plans for large investments in other countries, Buffett said.\n\nRead all market-related news here\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts and broking companies, not of Mint.

(AP) -- Warren Buffett's company reported a steep drop in earnings Saturday because the paper value of its investments fell and it sold off part of its massive Apple stake, but the tens of thousands of shareholders filling an Omaha arena to hear Buffett answer questions at the annual meeting later can take heart that Berkshire Hathaway's many businesses performed well.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion, and Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years -- even up to when his successor takes over.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nTens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute to Munger recounting his life and highlighting some of his best known quotes from the meetings over the years that drew applause, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured old interviews with Buffett and Munger talking about their epic friendship.\n\nThe video also featured several of the classic skits the investors made for meetings over the years with hoiliday stars like a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another video where Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over Munger.\n\nAs the video ended, everyone in the arena gave Munger a prolonged standing ovation to thank him for being what Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO. Abel and Jain are sharing the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year in the spot Munger used to occupy.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" out of habit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

The move quickly became one of the biggest topics as the meeting unfolded, even though Berkshire had sold some shares in Apple during the quarter before.\n\nDespite the sale, Apple is \"even better\" than American Express and Coca-Cola, which are \"wonderful\" businesses Berkshire also owns, Buffett told the crowd of thousands in Omaha. Unless something changes dramatically, Apple will remain its largest investment, he said, hinting that tax implications had motivated the sale. The iPhone may be one of the greatest products of all time, Buffett added.\n\nApple has faced a slew of headwinds - a US$2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project among them. Shares in the company are down about 5 per cent this year.\n\nThe sale bolstered Berkshire's cash pile, which climbed to a record US$189 billion at the end of March. Given current market conditions - where rate cuts are uncertain, inflation remains elevated and geopolitical risks abound - Buffett said he did not mind amassing the cash and said it could reach US$200 billion by the end of the quarter.\n\nThe cash hoard also benefited from higher interest rates, earning US$1.9 billion of interest income compared to US$1.1 billion during the same quarter a year prior.\n\nBerkshire's cash pile has grown amid a dearth of sizable deals. Buffett said on Saturday he's been unable to find recent acquisitions that would \"move the needle\" for the firm. Investors took it as a sign of his view on the stock market, too.\n\n\"Buffett is hoarding cash and therefore is bearish on the stock market,\" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management. \"He is unlikely to apply those funds unless he has a chance to buy an entire company or there is a major market sell-off of 30 per cent or more.\"\n\nHere are some other key takeaways from Berkshire's annual meeting and earnings:\n\nIn a sign the US economy remained robust at the beginning of the year, the conglomerate's collection of businesses - which include manufacturers, home builders, insurance companies and retailers - generated US$11.2 billion of operating earnings, a 39 per cent jump on the prior year.\n\nImproved results in its insurance businesses helped the increase, earning US$2.6 billion versus US$911 million in the same period last year. At its auto-insurer Geico, pre-tax profits more than doubled to US$1.93 billion, reflecting higher average policy premiums and lower claims, Berkshire said in its earnings statement. The business swung to profitability last year following several quarters of consecutive losses.\n\n\"There's still work to be done, but in the meantime, we are not going to shrink,\" Buffett said of Geico.\n\nBerkshire's railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3 per cent decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to \"unfavourable changes in the business mix\" as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nBerkshire's PacifiCorp recorded US$2.4 billion of estimated pre-tax probable losses from wildfires that spread across Oregon and California. About US$1.7 billion of that remains unpaid, Berkshire said in its earnings report.\n\nPacifiCorp faces liability claims from the blazes, and damages sought by plaintiffs in Oregon and California totalled approximately US$7 billion at the end of the first quarter, Berkshire said. At its annual meeting, Greg Abel - Buffett's appointed successor and vice chairman of Berkshire's non-insurance operations - pointed to an additional claim for US$30 billion that was filed last week, though he described it as \"an incremental claim\" to an existing lawsuit.\n\nThe absence of Charlie Munger, Buffett's long-time business partner who died in November age 99, cast a pall over the meeting, which kicked off with a tribute film featuring a highlight reel of Munger's famously acerbic one-liners.\n\nBuffett said the two had a \"lot of fun doing anything\" - he referenced golf and tennis - but they had even more fun \"with things that failed because then we really had to work, and work our way out of them\".\n\nAt one point, Buffett mistakenly called Abel \"Charlie\" when he turned to him, and answered a question from a young attendee about what he'd do if he had another day with to spend with Munger. Buffett answered that he would have spent it the same way as other days.\n\n\"He went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99, but the world was interested in him,\" Buffett said of Munger.\n\nBuffett referenced his own mortality throughout the day, as the question of succession arose repeatedly. The billionaire investor assured Berkshire's shareholders that the company's future was in good hands. Abel - who understands businesses \"extremely well\"- should take over Buffett's capital allocation when he is no longer around, he said.\n\n\"When you have got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" Buffett said, referring also to Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chair of insurance operations. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nBuffett also kept invoking leadership changes at Apple, noting the strong leadership of chief executive officer Tim Cook, who took over for Steve Jobs.\n\n\"Buffett made it very clear that the structure of the firm is in place,\" said J Dennis Jean-Jacques, founder and chief investment officer at Ocean Park Investments who first attended the meeting in 2000. \"It's going to become more important for shareholders to ensure the board of directors and managers keep the structure intact - they are smart people and are not afraid to write to the CEO to let them know things are going wayward.\"\n\nBerkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment. The company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is currently the subject of takeover talks.\n\n\"I did it all by myself, folks,\" Buffett said.

(AP) -- Warren Buffett's company reported a steep drop in earnings Saturday because the paper value of its investments fell, but the tens of thousands of shareholders filling an Omaha arena to hear Buffett answer questions at the annual meeting later can take heart that Berkshire's Hathaway's many businesses performed well.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\nThe main arena was already three-quarters full within half an hour of the doors opening Saturday because people are always eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett. But a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\n\"He was the sriracha sauce in the Berkshire Hathaway meeting,\" said investor Bill Smead, a regular at the event for 14 years. \"He gave it a lot of flavor.\"\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

Buffett always turned to Munger for his often-amusing two cents' worth.\n\nBut there was no Munger Saturday. And that moment served as another reminder of how much Berkshire's irascible vice chairman will be missed.\n\nMunger, who died in November at age 99, was fondly remembered as Berkshire's shareholders again filled the CHI Health Center to hear the Oracle of Omaha expound on business, capitalism and the principles behind Berkshire's long run of business success.\n\nThe movie that opened the meeting was completely dedicated to Munger and the role he played in helping Buffett build Berkshire into one of the world's largest business conglomerates.\n\nAnd Munger's name continued to be evoked throughout the day. That included when one young shareholder asked Buffett what he would do if he could spend one more day with Munger -- a question that sent Buffett down memory lane.\n\nHe said they enjoyed playing golf and tennis together in their younger days, but said they had just as much fun, and perhaps more, when they experienced business failings.\n\n\"In a sense, there's more fun having somebody who is your partner and digging your way out of a hole,\" he said. \"If I had another day with him, we probably would do the same things we did in the early days.\"\n\nHe said there was a time when he talked with Munger almost every day. He found remarkable that there was never a time they were mad at each other. He said it was amazing that Munger seemed to peak in life at age 99, never more popular.\n\nIn the end, in the wake of the loss of his dear friend, Buffett advised those listening to figure out who they like to spend time with and spend as much time with them as possible.\n\n\"Why wait until the last day?\" he said.\n\nInstead of Munger sitting at Buffett's side Saturday, it was Abel, Berkshire's CEO-in-waiting. Ajit Jain also sat on the stage in the morning. For years, Jain and Abel have served as Berkshire's vice chairmen in charge of business operations.\n\nDuring the five-hour Q&A session, shareholders heard more from Abel and Jain than ever before.\n\nAt one point, Abel paid homage to his predecessor by repeating one of Munger's most anticipated replies.\n\n\"I'm going to have to use it,\" Abel said, after Buffett referred a question to him. \" ' I have nothing to add.' \"\n\nBuffett feels fine at 93 but knows 'a little about actuarial tables'\n\nWhen asked to name his most trusted advisors today, Buffett again invoked Munger's memory.\n\n\"In terms of managing money, there wasn't anybody better to talk to for many, many decisions than Charlie,\" Buffett said.\n\nBut Buffett also expressed confidence in his own investment decision-making.\n\n\"In some respect, I talk to myself on investments,\" he said.\n\nDuring the movie, Buffett remarked on how close he and Munger were, saying they were \"like twins separated at birth and reunited.\" At the end, Buffett said of Berkshire: \"It lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nOf course, just how long Buffett will continue to sit on the stage -- he turns 94 in August -- is always on shareholders' minds. He indicated Saturday he feels fine but added, \"I do know a little about actuarial tables.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOne shareholder asked what will happen when Jain is gone. Jain has led the insurance operations that are in many ways the backbone of Berkshire for years.\n\n\"We won't find another Ajit,\" Buffett said. \"I hope you have to worry a little bit about me before you worry about Ajit.\"\n\nBuffett noted Berkshire's cash holdings -- now a record $189 billion -- that have continued to grow mainly because Buffett has not been able to find a suitable acquisition target large enough to \"move the needle.\"\n\n\"We only swing at pitches we like,\" he said. He also said the cash leaves Berkshire in position to strike if there's a \"big opportunity.\"\n\nThe quarterly report Berkshire issued earlier in the day revealed the company had sold about 13% of its shares of Apple stock.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that Berkshire \"sold a little Apple this year,\" but he downplayed the significance of it, suggesting there were tax reasons behind the sale. He said that Apple is and likely will continue to be Berkshire's largest stock holding.\n\nBerkshire's utilities draw protest from climate activists\n\nBuffett and Abel defended Berkshire's electric utilities for continuing to invest in new generating plants powered by natural gas, a fossil fuel, in the face of global climate concerns. A group of protesters gathered across 10th Street from the CHI Health Center to criticize Berkshire's utility operations.\n\nAbel said he took pride that on last month's Earth Day that all of the energy needs of Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy were met with wind.\n\nBut because solar and wind can be intermittent, natural gas units are required to \"fill the gap,\" he said. Until battery technology improves enough to let utilities to store renewable energy until it's needed, he said, gas will be needed for reliability.\n\nAdded Buffett: \"We have some very smart people working on it, but it's not something you can do overnight. I understand why people want it overnight.\"\n\nBuffett also talked about his fears about the potential for fraud using artificial intelligence.\n\nBuffett said he recently saw an artificially-created video that depicted him saying something he definitely didn't say, yet even his wife or daughter could not have been able to tell that it wasn't him. The video was so convincing, he said, that \"I would probably send money to myself in some crazy country.\"\n\n\"Scamming has always been part of the American scene, but . . . if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the industry of all time,\" he said.\n\nHe likened AI to nuclear weapons, saying once the genie is out of the bottle, he's not sure it can be put back in.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm,\" he said.\n\nShareholder Hriday Nayak, a college junior from Philadelphia, \"absolutely loved\" his first Berkshire meeting. He said he left feeling confident about the ability of Abel and Jain to lead Berkshire after Buffett.\n\n\"I think you can tell that they believe as strongly as Warren and Charlie do about Berkshire Hathaway, and they seem like good stewards going forward,\" he said.\n\nHe appreciated the investment wisdom, such as being patient, finding good managers to partner with, and not having to \"swing at every investment pitch.\"\n\nJeffrey Hill, an Omaha shareholder, especially enjoyed when the Q&A session turned to questions about life.\n\n\"How you live your life can help you with happiness and fulfillment and making money,\" he said. \"Because if you waste time on the wrong things, you're wasting this short amount of time we have.\"\n\nBuffett received a long standing ovation at the end of the meeting when he thanked shareholders for coming.\n\n\"I not only hope that you come next year,\" he said, \"but I hope that I come next year.\"\n\nBusiness\n\nRemembering Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger through his quips and wisdom\n\nHenry J.

That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\nTHOUSANDS ATTEND WARREN BUFFETT'S 'WOODSTOCK FOR CAPITALISTS'\n\nThe main arena was already three-quarters full within half an hour of the doors opening Saturday because people are always eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute to Munger recounting his life and highlighting some of his best known quotes from the meetings over the years, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured old interviews with Buffett and Munger talking about their epic friendship.\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing\n\nOMAHA, Nebraska: Warren Buffett will take center stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday as shareholders, some having traveled long distances, arrived to see the famed investor as well as his expected successor.\n\nThe meeting is the 60th for Buffett, 93, since he took over Berkshire in 1965. He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Warren to not have Charlie there,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, attending his 32nd Berkshire meeting.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND\n\nBerkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company.\n\n\"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\"\n\nBerkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six.\n\nThe weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession.\n\n\"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"", "source": {"uri": "telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETTelecom.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It was also the first since Munger, Mr Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nIn a downtown Omaha arena, Mr Buffett was joined on stage by vice-chairmen Greg Abel, who was designated Mr Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021, and Ajit Jain.\n\nMr Abel, 61, and Mr Jain, 72 have had direct oversight of Berkshire's dozens of operating subsidiaries since 2018, freeing Mr Buffett and, before his death, Munger to focus on capital allocation. Mr Buffett said he was happy with that arrangement.\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" he said. \"It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\nMr Buffett, 93, gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nBefore the meeting, Berkshire announced first-quarter results, including a 39 per cent jump in operating profit to a record US$11.2 billion.\n\nIn a surprise move, the conglomerate also reported it had sold about 13 per cent of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to US$135.4 billion from US$174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11 per cent in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main cause for Berkshire's cash hoard to soar. Mr Buffett said cash might grow from US$189 billion last quarter to US$200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite decreasing Berkshire's stake in Apple, Mr Buffett praised the tech company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest investments, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Mr Buffett said with Apple chief executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Mr Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple represented too much of Berkshire's now US$335.9 billion equity portfolio, Mr Buffett said Apple would remain the company's biggest investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nMr Buffett added that he expects the US government to increase taxes to tackle a widening fiscal deficit rather than reduce spending.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"},

That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\nThousands attend Warren Buffett's 'Woodstock for capitalists'\n\nThe main arena was already three-quarters full within half an hour of the doors opening Saturday because people are always eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute to Munger recounting his life and highlighting some of his best known quotes from the meetings over the years, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured old interviews with Buffett and Munger talking about their epic friendship.\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It was the first AGM without his long-time counterpart and close friend, Charlie Munger, who passed away last year, and the spotlight was naturally on Vice Chairpersons Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.\n\nLet's take a look at the ten key highlights from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting -\n\nPutting rest to speculations, Warren Buffett said Greg Abel, 61, who will be taking over the CEO job at Berkshire Hathaway, will control Berkshire Hathaway's investing decisions, including its stock portfolio, after him.\n\n\"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg. The responsibility has been with me, and I farmed out some of it, and I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think the responsibility should be that of the CEO,\" said Buffett, as quoted by CNBC.com.\n\nAbel, vice chairman of the non-insurance operation, whose name was revealed as Buffett's successor at the shareholder meeting in 2021, has been managing a significant portion of Berkshire's investments, including energy and retail.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway trimmed its stake in Apple for the second consecutive quarter as it reduced its investment in the tech-giant Apple by around 13 percent in the first quarter.\n\nBerkshire sold about 10 million shares of Apple, or 1 percent of its stake in the tech firm, in the last quarter of 2023. Berkshire again sold about 116 million Apple shares, or 13 percent stake in the company, in the first quarter of the current year.\n\nNevertheless, at the end of the January-March quarter, Apple was Berkshire's biggest holding. Buffett said the stake sale was for tax purposes, and Apple may remain Berkshire's largest holding at the end of the year.\n\nWarren Buffett believes that artificial intelligence (AI) scamming could be the next big \"growth industry\".\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett highlighted the potential of AI for scamming people due to its ability to create convincing fake images and messages. Scammers could use this technology to trick people into sending money by making fake pleas for help, like pretending to be a family member in trouble.\n\n\"When you think about the potential for scamming people, if you can reproduce images that I can't even tell, that say, 'I need money,' as your daughter, 'I just had a car crash, I need $50,000 wired.' I mean, scamming has always been part of the American scene, but this would make me, if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the growth industry of all time,\" CNBC quoted Buffett saying so.\n\nTaking 100 percent ownership of the decision, Buffett said Berkshire sold the entire stake in Paramount Global at a loss.\n\nBerkshire owned 63.3 million shares of Paramount at the end of 2023 after cutting about a third of its stake in the company in Q4 last year.\n\nBuffett appeared positive about India. He said there were \"loads of opportunities in a place like India\". Berkshire, however, does not have immediate plans for large investments in other countries, Buffett said.\n\n'There are various reasons to exit positions, one is when you need money, though that doesn't happen very often with us. It used to happen on every decision when I was 20 years old,' says Buffett .", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-05T122916.036-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 101, "textEnd": 111}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The results are nothing short of remarkable. Berkshire Hathaway's compound annual return since Buffett took over is 19.8% compared to 10.2% for the S&P 500.\n\nBuffett managed to achieve those results through all sorts of markets and economic conditions. His sole focus on finding great companies trading at a fair price has served him and his investors well. These stocks generally have greater downside protection along with the potential to outperform the overall market.\n\nSo, when Buffett identifies a company he thinks should outperform the market averages going forward, investors pay attention. Buffett shared his expectations for one such company in his most recent letter to shareholders.\n\nBuffett manages a $376 billion portfolio of equities with the help of Berkshire's other investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.\n\nBuffett has praised the operations and management teams for some of his largest holdings, including Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. Those four positions combined account for more than two-thirds of the entire portfolio. And Buffett is happy to hold those stocks indefinitely.\n\nBuffett and his team have recently bought significant stakes in Occidental Petroleum and Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty SiriusXM. The former has grown into a substantial position in the portfolio, especially when you account for Berkshire's preferred shares of Occidental. Buffett praised Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub in his most recent letter to shareholders, too.\n\nBut none of those are the one stock Buffett thinks should do better than average. Or maybe all of them are.\n\nThat's because Buffett believes Berkshire Hathaway itself is the company to own. Not only does it have a portfolio of great equity investments, but it also owns an insurance business, railroads, utility and energy businesses, and dozens of other operations.\n\n\"With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation,\" Buffett wrote to shareholders. But he didn't stop there. He also believes Berkshire's cash position and minimal capital needs means Berkshire \"should operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital.\"\n\nBuffett isn't promising the moon with an investment in Berkshire Hathaway. In fact, he believes the days of trouncing the S&P 500 are in the distant rearview mirror for the company due to its massive size ($862 billion as of this writing). \"Anything beyond 'slightly better' ... is wishful thinking,\" he wrote.\n\nIt's also worth echoing his comments from the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting. \"I happen to believe that Berkshire is about as sound as any single investment can be in terms of earning reasonable returns over time, but I would not want to bet my life on whether we beat the S&P 500 over the next ten years.\" Just because something should beat the market by any reasonable fundamental analysis, doesn't mean it will.\n\nBuffett isn't just the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, approximately 99% of his wealth is tied to the company. He says his family members are also extremely invested in the success of Berkshire. He talks about his sister Bertie in his most recent letter to shareholders, noting she and her three daughters have a large portion of their savings in Berkshire shares.\n\nIn other words, Buffett cares tremendously about Berkshire Hathaway and its shareholders. And as he notes, \"Caring doesn't guarantee results, but it does guarantee attention.\" And Buffett's attention is historically worth quite a bit.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has been putting a large portion of Berkshire's extra cash to work by buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway. The board of directors overhauled its capital return program in mid-2018, authorizing Buffett to buy back shares of the stock whenever he and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger believed the price of shares fell below its intrinsic value. Buffett is now the sole determinant of the stock's value since Munger's passing.\n\nSince the change, Buffett has bought back $74 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares. \"Such repurchases,\" Buffett points out to shareholders, \"work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire owns.\"\n\nDespite Buffett's notion that Berkshire holds a set of businesses that should outperform the average corporation, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 17.7x. By comparison, the S&P 500 trades at a forward PE of 20.8x.\n\nWhat's more, Berkshire holds a massive cash position of about $167.6 billion while Buffett continues to buy back shares every quarter. Both factors should give the stock a valuation premium. Instead, it appears to be a great bargain, especially considering the businesses and equity portfolio investors get for the price.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly $6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the $364 billion portfolio at $135.4 billion.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\nThe main arena was already three-quarters full within half an hour of the doors opening Saturday because people are always eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executivestalk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investorsthat he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nevertheless, tens of thousands of shareholders at the company's annual meeting Saturday looked forward to hearing from Buffett directly, buoyed by a jump in performance of the many companies Berkshire operates directly.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBuffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' strong performance.\n\nMichelle King of San Francisco does yoga in the See's Candies booth before the arrival of shareholders for the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting on Saturday in Omaha, Neb. Rebecca S. Gratz/Associated Press\n\nBy that measure, Berkshire beat expectations of the three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research, who had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nAs part of Buffett's stock sales, he trimmed about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. Holdings in the iPhone maker are still Berkshire's biggest stake, making up $135.4 billion of the company's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years, even when his successor Greg Abel eventually takes over.\n\nAs for Berkshire's core insurance businesses, the conglomerate reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBNSF railroad's profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of Bershire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profit at the utility unit that added $717 million to earnings.\n\nCash on hand rose to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said .\n\nTHOUSANDS ATTEND 'WOODSTOCK FOR CAPITALISTS'\n\nTens of thousands filled the Omaha, Neb., arena Saturday, eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured classic skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, attending dinner parties, meetings and regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nTHE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. Abel and Jain shared the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nANYTHING AND EVERYTHING\n\nAs always, Buffett addressed a variety of topics Saturday, though he never talks politics or reveals what he is buying. The stock he has been buying over the past year will remain a secret until he's required to disclose it in filings.\n\nHe described a recent uneasy experience with artificial intelligence, saying he saw a fake image of himself delivering a message in his voice about something he said he would never say. He predicted the technology will be a boon for scammers, and he's not sure if it will do more good than harm. The fake video was so convincing Buffett said he might have sent money to himself overseas.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nOn climate change, Jain said it's creating larger losses for insurance companies and driving up prices. It's hard to know if prices are increasing enough to handle the risk, but at least insurers have the opportunity to recalibrate their premiums each year, Jain said.\n\n\"We get a lot of letters from people concerned about climate change -- and I don't think they're wrong,\" Buffett said. \"But they don't understand the insurance business.\"\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. The 93-year-old says he hardly gets any calls from managers any more because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

At the meeting, Buffett offered insights into Berkshire's recent reduction of its substantial stake in Apple. Speaking before thousands of shareholders in attendance, Buffett emphasized that the decision to sell was not a signal of lost confidence in the tech giant but rather a strategic move in the face of broader economic and tax considerations.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway sold 115 million shares of Apple, its largest holding. Buffett, however, reassured investors that despite the sale, Apple would remain Berkshire's largest common stock investment. \"We have sold shares, and I would think it extremely likely that at the end of the year, Apple is still our largest common stock holding,\" Buffett stated.\n\nSherman Lamb, a 27-year-old Class B shareholder from Malaysia, noted that Buffett had excluded Apple from the list of Berkshire's long-duration ownership positions, which included Coca-Cola and American Express. In response, Buffett reiterated Berkshire's confidence in Apple, emphasizing that it remains a core business for the conglomerate.\n\n\"We look at Coca-Cola, American Express, and Apple as businesses,\" Buffett explained. \"There's a difference in tax factors, managerial responsibility, and other aspects, but we always look at every stock as a business.\" He added that unless extraordinary circumstances arise, Berkshire will continue to hold substantial positions in Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe decision to reduce Berkshire's Apple stake aligns with Buffett's broader strategy of building cash reserves amid economic uncertainties. The legendary investor highlighted that holding cash is advantageous when considering alternatives in the equity markets and the current global economic landscape.\n\n\"When I look at the alternatives available in the equity markets and the global situation, we find holding cash quite attractive,\" Buffett said. He noted that Berkshire doesn't attempt to predict market movements or follow technical indicators, but instead focuses on assessing stocks as businesses and deploying capital accordingly.\n\nBuffett also delved into the sale's tax implications. Berkshire Hathaway paid a 21% federal tax rate on the gains from its Apple stake reduction, a significant decrease from the 35% rate of past years. Buffett remains optimistic about Berkshire's future tax contributions despite paying substantial taxes.\n\n\"We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we're paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple,\" Buffett noted. \"It doesn't bother me to write that check.\"\n\nBuffett also acknowledged the potential for higher taxes given current fiscal policies. \"Something has to give, and I think higher taxes are quite likely,\" he said. \"The government owns a part of the earnings of our businesses. They don't own the assets but a percentage of the earnings.\"\n\nWhile Berkshire reduced its Apple holdings, Buffett emphasized that the tech giant remains a valuable business. He noted that Apple's services and ecosystem make it an exceptional company with a strong competitive edge.\n\n\"Apple is a wonderful business, and we will own Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express when Greg [Abel] takes over this place,\" Buffett said, referring to Berkshire Hathaway's vice-chairman.\n\nDespite selling a portion of Berkshire's Apple holdings, Buffett maintained that Berkshire's cash position and diversified portfolio ensure the company's stability and continued growth. He stressed that the sale was driven more by prudent portfolio management than concerns about Apple's prospects.\n\n\"We think it's appropriate that a country that has been as generous to our owners deserves that we pay substantial federal income taxes,\" Buffett said, noting that Berkshire sent over $5 billion to the U.S. federal government last year.\n\nReflecting on Berkshire's overall investment approach, Buffett highlighted the importance of viewing stocks as businesses and avoiding market speculation. \"Most things, if you keep working harder, you learn a little more math or physics,\" Buffett said. \"But with investments, you don't have to do that.\"\n\nHe credited Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor for helping shape his investment philosophy. \"If you look at stocks as businesses and treat the market as something that's there to serve you rather than instruct you, you'll do much better over time.\"\n\nDespite reducing Berkshire's Apple stake, Buffett remains confident in the company's long-term strategy and core holdings. \"We will end up, unless something dramatic happens, with Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nIn his customary candid and measured style, Buffett reassured Berkshire shareholders that their investments are in good hands, even amid the uncertain economic climate.", "source": {"uri": "webpronews.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a steep drop in earnings Saturday as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of shareholders looked forward to hearing from Buffett directly, buoyed by a jump in performance of the many companies Berkshire operates directly.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBuffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' strong performance.\n\nBy that measure, Berkshire beat expectations of the three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research, who had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nAs part of Buffett's stock sales, he trimmed about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. Holdings in the iPhone maker are still Berkshire's biggest stake, making up $135.4 billion of the company's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years, even when his successor Greg Abel eventually takes over.\n\nAs for Berkshire's core insurance businesses, the conglomerate reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of Bershire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profit at the utility unit that added $717 million to earnings.\n\nCash on hand rose to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nTens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured classic skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, attending dinner parties, meetings and regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. Abel and Jain shared the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nAs always, Buffett addressed a variety of topics Saturday, though he never talks politics or reveals what he is buying. The stock he has been buying over the past year will remain a secret until he's required to disclose it in filings.\n\nHe described a recent uneasy experience with artificial intelligence, saying he saw a fake image of himself delivering a message in his voice about something he said he would never say. He predicted the technology will be a boon for scammers, and he's not sure if it will do more good than harm. The fake video was so convincing Buffett said he might have sent money to himself overseas.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nOn climate change, Jain said it's creating larger losses for insurance companies and driving up prices. It's hard to know if prices are increasing enough to handle the risk, but at least insurers have the opportunity to recalibrate their premiums each year, Jain said.\n\n\"We get a lot of letters from people concerned about climate change - and I don't think they're wrong,\" Buffett said. \"But they don't understand the insurance business.\"\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. The 93-year-old says he hardly gets any calls from managers any more because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said. ___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

Buffett's company also posted a record operating profit exceeding $11 billion, as its insurance operations benefited from improved underwriting and higher income from investments as interest rates rose.\n\nThe value of Berkshire's stake in Apple fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, even though the iPhone maker's share price fell just 11% in the quarter. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings, in the quarter, ending with about 790 million.\n\nA large sale is an about-face for Buffett, who is normally tech-phobic but came to view Apple as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers. Some investors, however, have expressed concern that Apple consumed too much of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nBut the sales leave Buffett with more than six times the minimum $30 billion cash cushion he has pledged to keep. At Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nHe also said \"I don't mind\" expanding the cash stake, in light of alternatives in the equity markets and conflicts around the world, and said cash could top $200 billion by the end of June. The Apple sales resulted in Berkshire's realizing $11.2 billion of after-tax gains in the quarter from selling investments. Buffett maintained that he doesn't mind paying taxes.\n\nPROFIT SWELLS First-quarter operating profit rose 39% to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.\n\n\"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said in a research note. Net income fell 64% to $12.7 billion, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks.\n\nAn accounting rule requires Berkshire to report those gains with its financial results. Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility. Berkshire also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, and a small amount in the first three weeks of April.\n\nThe results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city. Buffett, 93, has led Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate whose dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Dairy Queen and See's Candies.\n\nThe diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry. GEICO HELPS POWER EARNINGS\n\nInsurance profit soared 80% to $5.2 billion. This included a more than doubling of underwriting profit at Geico, which benefited from rate increases and a large decline in the percentage of premiums it used to pay for accident losses. Profit fell 8% at the BNSF railroad, in part because of lower fuel surcharges and an \"unfavorable business mix.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy saw profit rise 72%, as improved operating performance from utilities helped offset rising legal costs at the HomeServices of America real estate brokerage related to legal settlements over brokerage commissions. The energy business still faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated

(AP) -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a steep drop in earnings Saturday as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of shareholders looked forward to hearing from Buffett directly, buoyed by a jump in performance of the many companies Berkshire operates directly.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBuffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' strong performance.\n\nBy that measure, Berkshire beat expectations of the three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research, who had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nAs part of Buffett's stock sales, he trimmed about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. Holdings in the iPhone maker are still Berkshire's biggest stake, making up $135.4 billion of the company's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years, even when his successor Greg Abel eventually takes over.\n\nAs for Berkshire's core insurance businesses, the conglomerate reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of Bershire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profit at the utility unit that added $717 million to earnings.\n\nCash on hand rose to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nTHOUSANDS ATTEND 'WOODSTOCK FOR CAPITALISTS'\n\nTens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured classic skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, attending dinner parties, meetings and regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nTHE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. Abel and Jain shared the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nANYTHING AND EVERYTHING\n\nAs always, Buffett addressed a variety of topics Saturday, though he never talks politics or reveals what he is buying. The stock he has been buying over the past year will remain a secret until he's required to disclose it in filings.\n\nHe described a recent uneasy experience with artificial intelligence, saying he saw a fake image of himself delivering a message in his voice about something he said he would never say. He predicted the technology will be a boon for scammers, and he's not sure if it will do more good than harm. The fake video was so convincing Buffett said he might have sent money to himself overseas.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nOn climate change, Jain said it's creating larger losses for insurance companies and driving up prices. It's hard to know if prices are increasing enough to handle the risk, but at least insurers have the opportunity to recalibrate their premiums each year, Jain said.\n\n\"We get a lot of letters from people concerned about climate change -- and I don't think they're wrong,\" Buffett said. \"But they don't understand the insurance business.\"\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. The 93-year-old says he hardly gets any calls from managers any more because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said. ___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

This year, Buffett will be without his longtime partner Charlie Munger, who died in November at the age of 99.\n\nBuffett will be joined on stage by Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairmen for operations. The two, particularly CEO-in-waiting Abel, have had an increasingly visible roles in recent annual meetings.\n\nView live updates below.\n\nBuffett: 'In some respect, I talk to myself on investments'\n\nWhen a child asked Buffett what he would do if he could spend one more day than Munger, it sent the investment guru down memory lane.\n\nHe said they enjoyed playing golf and tennis together, but said they had just as much fun, and perhaps more, when they had business failings.\n\n\"In a sense, there's more fun having somebody who is your partner and digging your way out of a hole,\" he said. \"If I had another day with him, we probably would do the same things we did in the early days.\"\n\nIn the end, Buffett said you should figure out who you like to spend time with and spend as much time with them as you can.\n\n\"Why wait until the last day?\" he said.\n\nWhen asked who his most trusted advisors are today, Buffett again invoked Munger's memory.\n\n\"In terms of managing money, there wasn't anybody better to talk to for many, many decisions than Charlie,\" Buffett said. \"It doesn't mean I don't talk to other people.\"\n\nBut Buffett also expressed confidence in his own investment decision-making.\n\nRemembering Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger through his quips and wisdom\n\n\"In some respect, I talk to myself on investments,\" he said.\n\nProtestors also joined the Berkshire gathering but outside the hall Buffett: Artificial intelligence is like nuclear weapons\n\nDuring the meeting's shareholder Q&A, Buffett talked about his fears of its potential for fraud in artificial intelligence.\n\nBuffett noted he recently saw a video of himself that even his wife or daughter could not have been able to tell was not him, saying something he definitely did not say.\n\nHe added the video was so convincing, \"I would probably sent money to myself in some crazy country.\"\n\n\"Scamming has always been part of the American scene, but... if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the industry of all time,\" he said.\n\nHe likened AI to nuclear weapons, saying once the genie is out of the bottle, he's not sure it can be put back in.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm, and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\n39% operating earnings; Buffett 'quite satisfied'\n\nBuffett began the meeting by going over Berkshire's first-quarter operating earnings reported earlier Saturday morning, up a robust 39% from the same quarter last year.\n\nHe also noted Berkshire's record cash holdings in the report: $189 billion, up from $168 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nBuffett said the company's cash pile could ultimately go over $200 million, the money accumulating largely because Buffett has not been able to find a suitable acquisition target to add to the Berkshire portfolio of operating companies.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless it's something with little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nHe said the cash leaves Berkshire in position to strike if there's a \"big opportunity,\" and said he remains always hopeful.\n\n\"We are quite satisfied with the position we are in,\" he said.\n\nOne of the other big revelations in the quarterly report was that Buffett and Berkshire had sold 13% of its shares of Apple stock, roughly $20 billion worth.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that Berkshire \"sold a little Apple this year,\" but he downplayed the significance of it. He said that Apple is and likely will continue to be Berkshire's largest stock holding.\n\nOpening movie traces Munger/Buffett partnership\n\nEven before the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting began Saturday, Munger's absence was felt.\n\nThe traditional annual movie that plays just before the meeting's start was entirely dedicated to Munger, the Warren Buffett confidant and sidekick.\n\nThe movie told the story of Munger's life growing up in Omaha and including some of his most famous quips from annual meetings and interviews.\n\nAt one point, the movie showed famous pairs from popular culture like Siskel and Ebert, Captain Kirk and Spock, Ernie and Bert, Beavis and Butthead, Gilligan and the Skipper, ending with a series of pictures of Munger and Buffett.\n\nSpeaking to how close the two were, Buffett at one point said he and Munger were \"like twins separated at birth and reunited.\"\n\nThe movie ended with Buffett again crediting Munger as the \"true architect\" of Berkshire's success.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Buffett said of Berkshire: \"It lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nWhen the meeting then opened, instead of Munger, it was Abel, Berkshire's CEO in waiting, sitting next to Buffett, with Jain next to him. Abel and Jain are Berkshire's vice chairman overseeing its business operations.\n\nAs doors open, a dash to get inside Photos: 2024 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_j_cordes@omaha.com", "name": "Henry J.

He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Warren to not have Charlie there,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, attending his 32nd Berkshire meeting.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND Berkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. \"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\" Berkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six. The weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession. \"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies,

(AP) - Warren Buffett's company reported a steep drop in earnings Saturday because the paper value of its investments fell, but the tens of thousands of shareholders filling an Omaha arena to hear Buffett answer questions at the annual meeting later can take heart that Berkshire's Hathaway's many businesses performed well.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\nThe main arena was already three-quarters full within half an hour of the doors opening Saturday because people are always eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett. But a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\n\"He was the sriracha sauce in the Berkshire Hathaway meeting,\" said investor Bill Smead, a regular at the event for 14 years. \"He gave it a lot of flavor.\"\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

In Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett lauded Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, emphasizing their readiness to assume greater responsibilities once he steps down. Abel, who was named Buffett's successor as CEO in 2021, will have the final say on capital allocation decisions for Berkshire's portfolio of public stocks. \"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\" Buffett remarked, underscoring their pivotal roles in the company's future.\n\nDespite reducing Berkshire's (BRK.B) stake in Apple (AAPL) by 13% -- a move that cut its holdings to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion -- Buffett was effusive in his praise for the iPhone maker. He referred to Apple as \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest and largest investments, American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO). With Apple CEO Tim Cook in attendance, Buffett hailed the iPhone as \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" reinforcing Apple's status as Berkshire's largest stock investment.\n\nMarket Overview:\n\n-Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting highlights leadership succession plans and record cash pile.\n\n-Despite trimming its Apple stake, the company remains bullish on the iPhone maker.\n\n-Berkshire's stock price trails the S&P 500 year-to-date but outperforms over the past decade.\n\nKey Points:\n\n-Warren Buffett expresses confidence in designated successors Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.\n\nBerkshire's first-quarter operating profit jumps 39% to a record $11.2 billion.\n\n-The company's cash hoard surges to $189 billion due partly to Apple stake reduction (13%).\n\n-Buffett praises Apple as \"an even better business\" than Berkshire's legacy investments (Amex, Coca-Cola).\n\n-Berkshire shareholders re-elect directors and reject shareholder proposals opposed by Buffett.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\n-Abel pledges to fight lawsuits against Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit.\n\n-Berkshire's cash pile could reach $200 billion this quarter, reflecting market valuation concerns.\n\n-Apple is likely to remain Berkshire's largest stock holding despite the recent sale.\n\nThe annual meeting, often dubbed the \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" was the first since the passing of Buffett's longtime business partner, Charlie Munger. Buffett paid tribute to Munger, crediting him as the \"architect of today's Berkshire,\" and shared a touching video montage that chronicled their partnership through the years. Despite the somber absence of Munger, the event remained upbeat, with thousands of shareholders lining up in the rain to hear Buffett share his insights on Berkshire's portfolio and broader musings on life.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway posted a 39% jump in operating profit to a record $11.2 billion in the first quarter, while its cash pile reached an all-time high of $189 billion. Buffett expects this to grow to $200 billion this quarter, citing high stock market valuations and geopolitical risks. Despite these concerns, shareholders re-elected all 14 directors and rejected six shareholder proposals opposed by Buffett. The 93-year-old investor concluded his remarks with optimism, stating, \"I enjoy managing money for the people who trust me. If I'm lucky, I can go on for six or seven years, or it might end tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "quiverquant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "quiverquant.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PacifiCorp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PacifiCorp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woodstock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Warren_Buffett_at_the_2015_SelectUSA_Investment_Summit.jpg/640px-Warren_Buffett_at_the_2015_SelectUSA_Investment_Summit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

At 93 years old, Buffett is one of the world's richest people, with an estimated fortune of around US$140 billion.\n\nBuffett has been investing in shares for decades, and his astronomical returns over the past six or seven decades is a source of inspiration for almost all investors.\n\nThankfully, Buffett has never been shy when it comes to educating other investors and teaching his secrets to investing success. Over the weekend, Buffett hosted the annual shareholders meeting of his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), famously held in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nRoutinely dubbed the 'Woodstock for capitalists', this annual meeting has Warren Buffett appear in front of crowds of shareholders and admirers and answer questions for hours. It's essential viewing for any aspiring value investor.\n\nBuffett is famous for his long-term 'buy-and-hold' investing style. He notably once said that his favourite length of time to own a share is 'forever'.\n\nWith this in mind, it was rather strange to see that Buffett had made a substantial sale of Berkshire's largest individual stock holdings when the company's most recent 10Q report came out just before the meeting. That largest holding is none other than the iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nYes, Berkshire's most recent 10Q filing - which covers the three months to 31 March 2024 - shows that Berkshire offloaded approximately 115 million Apple shares over the quarter in question. At recent pricing, this sale would amount to roughly US$21 billion worth of stock.\n\nTo be fair, Buffett, through Berkshire, still has a US$144.8 billion position in Apple. It remains Berkshire's largest single holding by far, making up just over 40% of the company's stock portfolio.\n\nBut it is odd to see Buffett selling down this position by more than US$20 billion, given what he has said in the past about his love of owning high-quality companies forever.\n\nSo what gives? Well, Buffett was asked about Apple at the Berkshire meeting over the weekend, and whether his positive outlook on the company has changed.\n\nHere's some of what he said:\n\nNo... But we have sold shares, and I would say that at the end of the year, I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have now...\n\nWe will have Apple as our largest investment, but I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what's available, the equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive...\n\nAnd I would say with the present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give, and I think that higher taxes are quite likely, and the government wants to take a greater share of your income, or mine or Berkshire's, they can do it...\n\nAnd if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it at a higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\n\nSo it seems that Buffett reckons some of the capital that Berkshire has deployed in Apple is better off sitting in cash right now. With interest rates at decade-highs, Berkshire can get a risk-free rate of over 5% on its cash right now.\n\nIt seems that Buffett would prefer to get this 'safe' level of return on that US$21 billion in the current climate rather than have it invested in Apple.\n\nHe also alludes to perhaps taking advantage of the current low US corporate tax rate to crystalise some of the extraordinary gains Berkshire has made on its Apple investment over time.\n\nIt could be that Buffett would rather pay a 21% corporate tax rate today than pay a higher rate in the future if he feels that trimming Berkshire's Apple position is inevitable.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sebastian_bowen@fool.com.au", "name": "Sebastian Bowen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_and_hold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buy and hold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woodstock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/woman-looking-at-iPhone-16_9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nHundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions.

Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Warren to not have Charlie there,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, attending his 32nd Berkshire meeting.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND Berkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported a record quarterly profit, bolstered by a significant increase in income from insurance underwriting. Net income fell, reflecting much lower unrealized gains from its common stock holdings. The size of Berkshire's stake in Apple stake fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. \"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\" Berkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six. The weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession. \"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia Osterman and Jason Neely)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Berkshire realized $11.2 billion of after-tax gains in the quarter from selling investments.\n\nPROFIT SWELLS\n\nFirst-quarter operating profit rose 39% to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.\n\nNet income fell 64% to $12.7 billion, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks.\n\nAn accounting rule requires Berkshire to report those gains with its financial results. Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.\n\nBerkshire also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, and a small amount in the first three weeks of April.\n\nThe results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.\n\nBuffett, 93, has led Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate whose dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Dairy Queen and See's Candies.\n\nThe diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.\n\nGEICO HELPS POWER EARNINGS\n\nInsurance profit soared 80% to $5.2 billion. This included a more than doubling of underwriting profit at Geico, which benefited from rate increases and a large decline in the percentage of premiums it used to pay for accident losses.\n\nProfit fell 8% at the BNSF railroad, in part because of lower fuel surcharges and an \"unfavorable business mix.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy saw profit rise 72%, as improved operating performance from utilities helped offset rising legal costs at the HomeServices of America real estate brokerage related to a nationwide settlement over brokerage commissions.\n\nThe energy business still faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors":

It was a packed house on Saturday, with additional attendees spurred on by the passing last year of Buffett's long-time friend and Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger. Warren Buffett, CEO and Chairman, and Greg Abel, Vice Chairman of Non-insurance, answered questions from shareholders for over five hours. Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman of Insurance, joined in answering questions for the first part of the meeting. The traditional movie that opened the gathering focused on the memory of Charlie Munger, who died late last year at age 99. There is much more about the enduring legacy and wisdom of Charlie Munger here.\n\nAs always, Buffett began by briefly reviewing first-quarter earnings. Operating earnings were a whopping 39% higher than last year's same quarter, so it was a solid start to the year. Buffett reiterated that operating earnings are the \"most descriptive\" way to view Berkshire since it removes the short-term volatility of market fluctuations in the net earnings. He further predicted that higher yields and cash levels should lead to higher investment income in 2024. Still, investors should not automatically \"multiply the insurance earnings by four\" since storms and accompanying losses do occur.\n\nOne of the biggest stories from the meeting was that Berkshire Hathaway sold some of its massive stake in Apple (AAPL) in the first quarter. Before this sale, Apple stock comprised over fifty percent of its publicly traded portfolio, but Berkshire remains Apple's largest shareholder aside from index funds. Despite selling about thirteen percent of its stake, Buffett said it's likely that Apple will remain the largest common stock holding at the end of the year. Buffett said that noted Berkshire holdings of American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO) were \"wonderful\" businesses but said Apple is an even better one.\n\nIn the wake of Munger's passing, there were several questions regarding succession when Buffett is no longer at the helm. While it was known that Greg Abel was in line to take over as chairman and CEO, Buffett indicated that it would be his preference for Abel to take over the ultimate responsibility for all capital allocation decisions, including stock picking. Buffett noted that this decision would ultimately be up to the board since he would be gone.\n\nBuffett provided a simple but crucial blueprint for the goal of Berkshire's management. The first goal would be to \"increase operating earnings.\" Secondly, \"decrease shares outstanding,\" which would boost operating earnings per share at a faster rate. Lastly, \"hope for an occasional big opportunity,\" allowing for a sizable investment of cash at an attractive expected return.

Munger, a key Berkshire executive, died in 2023.\n\nThere was a bit of a stir Saturday, May 4, when people looking at Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly report noted that the value of its Apple stock holdings was down 22%.\n\nDid that mean Warren Buffett was bailing on its biggest holding?\n\nNo, Buffett told shareholders attending the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and (BRK.B) in Omaha, Neb. on Saturday.\n\nWhy sell Apple?\n\nBut the number is a bit misleading. Berkshire reportedly did sell about 115 million Apple shares, about 13% of its stake. Based on the stock price, Berkshire's Apple stake ended the first quarter with 790 million shares.\n\nThe transactions were likely spread out over the first quarter. Using Apple's March 31 closing price, Buffett sold about $20 billion worth of Apple shares.\n\nSo, why sell at all? Basically, for tax reasons, Buffett said.\n\nApple's shares had risen 48% in 2023.\n\nApple's shares, however, fell nearly 11% during the first quarter of 2024. They're up 7% since the end of March and 7.7% just since the end of April.\n\nBerkshire is up 11% this year but down 5% so far in the second quarter.\n\nRelated: Analysts weigh in on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has been a shareholder of Apple since 2016 when the late Charlie Munger convinced Buffett it was a great stock to buy. Munger, Berkshire's long-time vice chairman, died in late 2023.\n\nThe investment has been fantastically successful, and Buffett still believes deeply in Apple.\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\nHe predicted Apple stock will still be Berkshire's biggest holding at the end of the year. And, he noted, Apple CEO Tim Cook was attending the meeting.\n\nSometimes, it's OK to pay taxes\n\nBuffett also suggested that share sales may be tied to his view that tax rates may possibly be going higher to fund a ballooning fiscal deficit in the U.S.\n\nPaying the taxes on selling Apple didn't bother Buffett \"in the least.\"\n\nMore Warren Buffett:\n\nAnalyst revamps Occidental Petroleum stock price target after oil rallyWhy the S&P 500 is getting 2 new members this weekMorningstar unveils 10 cheap stocks with wide moats\n\nAnd he added, \"I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it -- and if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\"\n\nBerkshire's biggest holding\n\nApple remains Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holding, representing about 40% of the conglomerate's stock portfolio, which had a total value of about $335.9 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the portfolio was valued at $353.8 billion, with Apple representing about 49% of the portfolio's value.\n\nApple and stocks of four other companies represented about 75% of the portfolio's value at the end of March. The others are American Express (AXP) , Bank of America (BAC) , Coca-Cola, and Chevron (CVX) . That's down from 79% in December.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99 Our journalism needs your support.

The investing legend died on Nov. 28, 2024, just weeks before what would have been his 100th birthday. Munger, the former vice chairman of Berkshire, was known for his sharp wit, and his absence is being felt by the thousands attending the event.\n\nAmong the questions that will be top of mind at the \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" will be what Buffett's mystery holding is. The firm was granted confidential treatment for an investment in past quarters, and it remains to be seen if that will continue or if Buffett will share more information at this weekend's gathering.\n\nThere's a chance that Buffett will reveal the mystery wager Berkshire has been buying for two quarters straight.\n\nIn the third and fourth quarters of 2023, Berkshire was granted confidential treatment to keep the details of one or more of its stock holdings confidential.\n\nMany speculated that the secret purchase could be a bank stock as the conglomerate's cost basis for \"banks, insurance, and finance\" equity holdings jumped by $3.59 billion in the second half of last year, according to separate Berkshire filings.\n\nIt's relatively rare for Berkshire to request such a treatment. The last time it kept a purchase confidential was when it bought Chevron and Verizon in 2020.\n\n-- Yun Li\n\nCNBC will be livestreaming Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, beginning at 9:30 a.m. ET. Viewers can expect a lively discussion that will provide insight into Warren Buffett's view of the market, what types of deals Berkshire could make in the year ahead and other key topics.\n\nHere is a rundown of the day's events:\n\n9:30 a.m. - 10:15 a.m.: Pre-show anchored by Becky Quick and Mike Santoli\n\n10:15 a.m. - 1 p.m.: Berkshire Hathaway morning Q&A session\n\n1 p.m. - 2 p.m.: Halftime show anchored by Becky Quick and Mike Santoli\n\n2 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.: Afternoon Q&A session of annual meeting\n\n4:00 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.: Post-show anchored by Becky Quick and Mike Santoli\n\nThe annual meeting could start on a somber note with the absence of Charlie Munger on everyone's mind.\n\nPandemic lockdown apart, it will be the first without Munger, Buffett's longtime partner who passed away in November at the age of 99.\n\nFor the first time, Berkshire will broadcast its annual meeting movie that had previously always been reserved only for those in attendance in Omaha. Many speculate this year's will be a tear-jerker tribute to Munger.\n\nVice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor, will fill Munger's seat in the afternoon session, helping answer shareholder questions.\n\nMunger left a mark on generations of investors in a host of ways thanks to a long and fruitful life.

The audience laughed when Buffett answered: \"The problem is I don't know anything about AI.\"\n\nBuffett said AI is \"profound,\" and he drew an analogy to the implications from development of nuclear bombs.\n\nAbel said AI can make business more effective, efficient and improve safety.\n\nBuffett: Shareholder giving is 'inspiring'\n\nBuffett explained his belief that Berkshire shareholders are unique for their selfless philanthropy.\n\nA significant number of Berkshire shareholders, who are not members of wealthy families, contribute millions quietly. Buffett noted that Nebraska has its share of such folks.\n\nSuch people have deferred their own consumption, saved and given back, he said.\n\nHe called it \"inspiring.\"\n\nBuffett: 'In some respect, I talk to myself on investments'\n\nWhen a child asked Buffett what he would do if he could spend one more day with Munger, it sent the investment guru down memory lane.\n\nHe said they enjoyed playing golf and tennis together, but said they had just as much fun, and perhaps more, when they had business failings.\n\n\"In a sense, there's more fun having somebody who is your partner and digging your way out of a hole,\" he said. \"If I had another day with him, we probably would do the same things we did in the early days.\"\n\nIn the end, Buffett said you should figure out who you like to spend time with and spend as much time with them as you can.\n\n\"Why wait until the last day?\" he said.\n\nWhen asked who his most trusted advisors are today, Buffett again invoked Munger's memory.\n\n\"In terms of managing money, there wasn't anybody better to talk to for many, many decisions than Charlie,\" Buffett said. \"It doesn't mean I don't talk to other people.\"\n\nBut Buffett also expressed confidence in his own investment decision-making.\n\nRemembering Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger through his quips and wisdom\n\n\"In some respect, I talk to myself on investments,\" he said.\n\nProtestors also joined the Berkshire gathering but outside the hall Buffett: Artificial intelligence is like nuclear weapons\n\nDuring the meeting's shareholder Q&A, Buffett talked about his fears of its potential for fraud in artificial intelligence.\n\nBuffett noted he recently saw a video of himself that even his wife or daughter could not have been able to tell was not him, saying something he definitely did not say.\n\nHe added the video was so convincing, \"I would probably sent money to myself in some crazy country.\"\n\n\"Scamming has always been part of the American scene, but... if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the industry of all time,\" he said.\n\nHe likened AI to nuclear weapons, saying once the genie is out of the bottle, he's not sure it can be put back in.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm, and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\n39% operating earnings; Buffett 'quite satisfied'\n\nBuffett began the meeting by going over Berkshire's first-quarter operating earnings reported earlier Saturday morning, up a robust 39% from the same quarter last year.\n\nHe also noted Berkshire's record cash holdings in the report: $189 billion, up from $168 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nBuffett said the company's cash pile could ultimately go over $200 million, the money accumulating largely because Buffett has not been able to find a suitable acquisition target to add to the Berkshire portfolio of operating companies.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless it's something with little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nHe said the cash leaves Berkshire in position to strike if there's a \"big opportunity,\" and said he remains always hopeful.\n\n\"We are quite satisfied with the position we are in,\" he said.\n\nOne of the other big revelations in the quarterly report was that Buffett and Berkshire had sold 13% of its shares of Apple stock, roughly $20 billion worth.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that Berkshire \"sold a little Apple this year,\" but he downplayed the significance of it. He said that Apple is and likely will continue to be Berkshire's largest stock holding.\n\nOpening movie traces Munger/Buffett partnership\n\nEven before the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting began Saturday, Munger's absence was felt.\n\nThe traditional annual movie that plays just before the meeting's start was entirely dedicated to Munger, the Warren Buffett confidant and sidekick.\n\nThe movie told the story of Munger's life growing up in Omaha and including some of his most famous quips from annual meetings and interviews.\n\nAt one point, the movie showed famous pairs from popular culture like Siskel and Ebert, Captain Kirk and Spock, Ernie and Bert, Beavis and Butthead, Gilligan and the Skipper, ending with a series of pictures of Munger and Buffett.\n\nSpeaking to how close the two were, Buffett at one point said he and Munger were \"like twins separated at birth and reunited.\"\n\nThe movie ended with Buffett again crediting Munger as the \"true architect\" of Berkshire's success.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Buffett said of Berkshire: \"It lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nWhen the meeting then opened, instead of Munger, it was Abel, Berkshire's CEO in waiting, sitting next to Buffett, with Jain next to him. Abel and Jain are Berkshire's vice chairman overseeing its business operations.\n\nAs doors open, a dash to get inside Photos: 2024 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_j_cordes@omaha.com", "name": "Henry J.

This year, Buffett will be without his longtime partner Charlie Munger, who died in November at the age of 99.\n\nBuffett will be joined on stage by Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairmen for operations.

Berkshire realized $11.2 billion of after-tax gains in the quarter from selling investments.\n\nFirst-quarter operating profit rose 39% to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.\n\nNet income fell 64% to $12.7 billion, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks.\n\nAn accounting rule requires Berkshire to report those gains with its financial results. Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.\n\nBerkshire also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, and a small amount in the first three weeks of April.\n\nThe results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.\n\nBuffett, 93, has led Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate whose dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Dairy Queen and See's Candies.\n\nThe diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.\n\nInsurance profit soared 80% to $5.2 billion. This included a more than doubling of underwriting profit at Geico, which benefited from rate increases and a large decline in the percentage of premiums it used to pay for accident losses.\n\nProfit fell 8% at the BNSF railroad, in part because of lower fuel surcharges and an \"unfavorable business mix.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy saw profit rise 72%, as improved operating performance from utilities helped offset rising legal costs at the HomeServices of America real estate brokerage related to a nationwide settlement over brokerage commissions.\n\nThe energy business still faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska;

The meeting, part of a weekend Buffett calls \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" was the first since [longtime partner Charlie] Munger died in November at age 99. Buffett described Munger, his longtime his friend and foil, as the \"architect of today's Berkshire.\"\n\nBuffett gave no sign he plans to step aside, telling shareholders, \"I feel fine,\" while joking he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nIn a surprise, Berkshire reported it had sold about 13% of its Apple shares, reducing the value of its stake to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion. Apple's stock price fell 11% in the quarter.\n\nThe sale was the main reason Berkshire's cash hoard soared. Buffett said cash might grow to $200 billion this quarter, reflecting the risks he sees from high stock market valuations and geopolitical conflicts.\n\nDespite reducing the Apple stake, Buffett praised the company, saying it was \"an even better business\" than two of Berkshire's oldest and largest investments, American Express, and Coca-Cola.\n\nThe iPhone was \"one of the greatest products, and it may be the greatest product, of all time,\" Buffett said with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in the audience.\n\nBerkshire invested in Apple in 2016, and the normally tech-phobic Buffett came to view it as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers.\n\nWhile some investors have expressed concern that Apple comprised too much of Berkshire's equity portfolio, Buffett said Apple would remain his company's biggest stock investment, barring unforeseen events.\n\nSupport MacDailyNews at no extra cost to you by using this link to shop at Amazon.\n\n\u200e\n\nMacDailyNews Take: As for his Apple-heavy portfolio, as Buffet famously said many years ago, \"Diversification is protection against ignorance.

And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nEARNINGS BEFORE MUSINGS The day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA NOTABLE ABSENCE Devotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nNEXT GEN LEADERS Munger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nAbel offered a twist on Munger's classic \"I have nothing to add\" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying \"The only thing I would add.\"\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nA LOOK TO THE FUTURE Buffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\" ___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

(AP) -- Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nEarnings before musings\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64 percent from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39 percent to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA notable absence\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like, \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80 percent of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nNext gen leaders\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said, \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nAbel offered a twist on Munger's classic \"I have nothing to add\" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying \"The only thing I would add.\"\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nA look to the future\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said.\n\nUltimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year, but I hope that I come next year.\"\n\nSee's Candies associates, including Holly Pellicano of San Francisco, center, do yoga together before shareholders arrive for the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting on Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Omaha, Neb.

Operating earnings rose, driven by insurance businesses. Amidst rising interest rates, the company engages in stock buybacks and eyes strategic investments.Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s cash pile hit yet another record as billionaire investor Warren Buffett confronted a dearth of big-ticket deals. Operating earnings also rose, buoyed by his collection of insurance businesses.\n\nThe firm's hoard increased to $189 billion at the end of the first quarter, topping the record it set at year-end. The company also reported first-quarter operating earnings of $11.2 billion, versus $8.07 billion for the same period a year earlier.\n\nBuffett, 93, has long decried a lack of meaningful deals that he said would give the firm a shot at \"eye-popping\" results. Even as the company ramped up acquisitions in recent years, including an $11.6 billion deal to buy Alleghany Corp. and its purchase of shares in Occidental Petroleum Corp., Berkshire has struggled to find sizable deals. That's left Buffett with more cash -- what he called an unrivaled mountain of capital -- than he and his investing deputies could quickly deploy.\n\nAs Berkshire's annual meeting kicked off in Omaha on Saturday, Buffett said that \"it's a fair assumption\" that its cash pile will hit $200 billion at end of this quarter with few opportunities for needle-moving acquisitions on the horizon.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" he told the crowd of thousands. The company hopes for an \"occasional big opportunity,\" he added, later noting that it's looking at an investment in Canada.\n\nStill, having such a vast sum of cash in an increasingly \"complicated and intertwined\" world where more can go wrong can allow the firm to step in when opportunities present themselves, Buffett said. Berkshire wants to be ready to act when that happens, he said.\n\nApple Selling\n\nThe company sold some of its Apple Inc. shares in the quarter, reporting a $135.4 billion stake at the end of March, down from $174.3 billion at the end of the year. Apple has been hit by a drumbeat of negative news, including a $2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project.\n\nDespite the sale, Buffett praised Apple, saying it's an \"even better\" business than two others it owns shares in -- American Express and Coca-Cola. Apple will likely remain its top holding by the year-end, Buffett said. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive officer, was in the audience.\n\nBerkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment. The company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is currently the subject of takeover talks.\n\nIn the absence of deals, Berkshire has turned to buying back its own shares. It spent about $2.6 billion doing that in the first quarter, it said in its earnings statement Saturday.\n\nStill, Berkshire's giant cash pile has been a beneficiary of higher interest rates, which helped drive up interest and other investment income to $1.9 billion, from $1.1 billion in the first quarter of last year.\n\n\"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. \"Rising rates are enabling Berkshire's still considerable cash balance to once again earn a competitive return.\"\n\nBerkshire's earnings rose despite Buffett's warning in May last year that profits at most of its operations would fall in 2023 as an \"incredible period\" for the US economy draws to an end. With businesses including railroad, retail, construction and energy, Berkshire is closely watched as a litmus test for US economic health, particularly amid elevated inflation and interest rates.\n\nEarnings at its collection of insurance businesses jumped to $2.6 billion, versus $911 million in the same period last year, thanks to improved results at its auto insurer Geico, fewer catastrophes and an increase in insurance investment income. The conglomerate's railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3% decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to \"unfavorable changes in business mix\" as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nBerkshire reported $12.7 billion in earnings attributable to shareholders for the first quarter, compared to $35.5 billion for the same period a year ago, largely due to lower investment income.

This year, Buffett will be without his longtime partner Charlie Munger, who died in November at the age of 99.\n\nBuffett will be joined on stage by Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's vice chairmen for operations. The two, particularly CEO-in-waiting Abel, have had an increasingly visible roles in recent annual meetings.\n\n39% operating earnings; Buffett 'quite satisfied'\n\nBuffett began the meeting by going over Berkshire's first-quarter operating earnings reported earlier Saturday morning, up a robust 39% from the same quarter last year.\n\nHe also noted Berkshire's record cash holdings in the report: $189 billion, up from $168 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nBuffett said the company's cash pile could ultimately go over $200 million, the money accumulating largely because Buffett has not been able to find a suitable acquisition target to add to the Berkshire portfolio of operating companies.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless it's something with little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nHe said the cash leaves Berkshire in position to strike if there's a \"big opportunity,\" and said he remains always hopeful.\n\n\"We are quite satisfied with the position we are in,\" he said.\n\nOne of the other big revelations in the quarterly report was that Buffett and Berkshire had sold 13% of its shares of Apple stock, roughly $20 billion worth.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that Berkshire \"sold a little Apple this year,\" but he downplayed the significance of it. He said that Apple is and likely will continue to be Berkshire's largest stock holding.\n\nOpening movie traces Munger/Buffett partnership\n\nEven before the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting began Saturday, Munger's absence was felt.\n\nThe traditional annual movie that plays just before the meeting's start was entirely dedicated to Munger, the Warren Buffett confidant and sidekick.\n\nThe movie told the story of Munger's life growing up in Omaha and including some of his most famous quips from annual meetings and interviews.\n\nAt one point, the movie showed famous pairs from popular culture like Siskel and Ebert, Captain Kirk and Spock, Ernie and Bert, Beavis and Butthead, Gilligan and the Skipper, ending with a series of pictures of Munger and Buffett.\n\nSpeaking to how close the two were, Buffett at one point said he and Munger were \"like twins separated at birth and reunited.\"\n\nThe movie ended with Buffett again crediting Munger as the \"true architect\" of Berkshire's success.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Buffett said of Berkshire: \"It lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nWhen the meeting then opened, instead of Munger, it was Abel, Berkshire's CEO in waiting, sitting next to Buffett, with Jain next to him. Abel and Jain are Berkshire's vice chairman overseeing its business operations.\n\nAs doors open, a dash to get inside\n\nStay tuned for more live updates\n\nPhotos: 2024 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_j_cordes@omaha.com", "name": "Henry J.

The results are nothing short of remarkable. Berkshire Hathaway's compound annual return since Buffett took over is 19.8% compared to 10.2% for the S&P 500.\n\nBuffett managed to achieve those results through all sorts of markets and economic conditions. His sole focus on finding great companies trading at a fair price has served him and his investors well. These stocks generally have greater downside protection along with the potential to outperform the overall market.\n\nSo, when Buffett identifies a company he thinks should outperform the market averages going forward, investors pay attention. Buffett shared his expectations for one such company in his most recent letter to shareholders.\n\nBuffett manages a $376 billion portfolio of equities with the help of Berkshire's other investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.\n\nBuffett has praised the operations and management teams for some of his largest holdings, including Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. Those four positions combined account for more than two-thirds of the entire portfolio. And Buffett is happy to hold those stocks indefinitely.\n\nBuffett and his team have recently bought significant stakes in Occidental Petroleum and Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty SiriusXM. The former has grown into a substantial position in the portfolio, especially when you account for Berkshire's preferred shares of Occidental. Buffett praised Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub in his most recent letter to shareholders, too.\n\nBut none of those are the one stock Buffett thinks should do better than average. Or maybe all of them are.\n\nThat's because Buffett believes Berkshire Hathaway itself is the company to own. Not only does it have a portfolio of great equity investments, but it also owns an insurance business, railroads, utility and energy businesses, and dozens of other operations.\n\n\"With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation,\" Buffett wrote to shareholders. But he didn't stop there. He also believes Berkshire's cash position and minimal capital needs means Berkshire \"should operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital.\"\n\nBuffett isn't promising the moon with an investment in Berkshire Hathaway. In fact, he believes the days of trouncing the S&P 500 are in the distant rearview mirror for the company due to its massive size ($862 billion as of this writing). \"Anything beyond 'slightly better' ... is wishful thinking,\" he wrote.\n\nIt's also worth echoing his comments from the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting. \"I happen to believe that Berkshire is about as sound as any single investment can be in terms of earning reasonable returns over time, but I would not want to bet my life on whether we beat the S&P 500 over the next ten years.\" Just because something should beat the market by any reasonable fundamental analysis, doesn't mean it will.\n\nBuffett isn't just the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, approximately 99% of his wealth is tied to the company. He says his family members are also extremely invested in the success of Berkshire. He talks about his sister Bertie in his most recent letter to shareholders, noting she and her three daughters have a large portion of their savings in Berkshire shares.\n\nIn other words, Buffett cares tremendously about Berkshire Hathaway and its shareholders. And as he notes, \"Caring doesn't guarantee results, but it does guarantee attention.\" And Buffett's attention is historically worth quite a bit.\n\nMoreover, Buffett has been putting a large portion of Berkshire's extra cash to work by buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway. The board of directors overhauled its capital return program in mid-2018, authorizing Buffett to buy back shares of the stock whenever he and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger believed the price of shares fell below its intrinsic value. Buffett is now the sole determinant of the stock's value since Munger's passing.\n\nSince the change, Buffett has bought back $74 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway shares. \"Such repurchases,\" Buffett points out to shareholders, \"work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire owns.\"\n\nDespite Buffett's notion that Berkshire holds a set of businesses that should outperform the average corporation, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 17.7x. By comparison, the S&P 500 trades at a forward PE of 20.8x.\n\nWhat's more, Berkshire holds a massive cash position of about $167.6 billion while Buffett continues to buy back shares every quarter. Both factors should give the stock a valuation premium. Instead, it appears to be a great bargain, especially considering the businesses and equity portfolio investors get for the price.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

During Saturday morning's question-and-answer session for shareholders, Buffett said the insurance business is the \"most important business at Berkshire.\"\n\nIn the same quarter, Berkshire offloaded a net $17 billion worth of stocks and bought back $2.6 billion worth of its own stock, up from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter.\n\nThe highly anticipated and closely watch annual conference, dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" by its fans, kicked off Friday in Buffett's hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Shareholders wait all year for a chance to hear directly from the 93-year-old Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha. He was joined on the panel by vice chairs Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, in the first conference without Buffett's right-hand business partner and friend, Charlie Munger.\n\nHere are some of the biggest takeaways from Saturday's marathon Q&A session.\n\nBerkshire's holdings in Apple were valued at $135.4 billion for first quarter of 2024, a 22% drop from $174.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023. It was the second consecutive quarter that the conglomerate has reduced its holdings of the iPhone maker.\n\nApple's share price fell 11% in the quarter, as the tech giant endured a rough start to 2024.\n\nBut Buffett said it's \"extremely likely\" that Apple remains Berkshire's largest common stock holding -- and that it will stay its largest holding unless something dramatic happens.\n\n\"Unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple, and American Express, and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" Buffett said, referring to Abel, his handpicked successor.\n\nBerkshire reported that its American Express stake was worth $34.5 billion last quarter, and its Coca-Cola holdings were worth $24.5 billion. Chevron and Bank of America were also in the company's top five holdings.\n\nMunger, who served as vice chairman of Berkshire since 1978, died in November, just weeks before his 100th birthday. He was considered Buffett's right-hand man and most trusted advisor.\n\nHis presence was very much felt at this year's conference. Prior to the start of the session, CNBC showed a tribute to Munger. Across several questions, Buffett reminisced on his relationship with Munger.\n\n\"In terms of managing money, there wasn't anybody in the world to talk to for the many, many decades than Charlie,\" he said.\n\n\"Charlie, in all the years we worked together, not only never once lied to me, ever, but he also didn't even shape things so he told half-lies or quarter-lies to sort of stack the deck in the direction he wanted to go,\" Buffett said.\n\nHe also said he trusts his children and his wife \"totally.\"\n\n\"But that doesn't mean I ask them what stocks to buy,\" he joked. Without Munger, he talks to himself about investments.\n\nWhen asked what Buffett would do if he had one more day with Munger, he said they would \"probably do the same thing [they] were doing the earlier days.\"\n\n\"We always lived in a way where we were happy with what we were doing everyday,\" he said. \"We had a lot of fun doing anything, we played golf together, we played tennis together, we did everything together.\"\n\nGEICO auto insurance became a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire in 1996, and has since been a significant revenue driver. In the first quarter, GEICO brought in $10.2 billion in revenues for the conglomerate.\n\nThe future of autonomous vehicles raises questions about the impact on insurance revenues. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said self-driving cars could reduce accidents by 50% compared with human drivers.\n\n\"If accidents get reduced 50% its going to be good for society, and it's going to be bad for insurance companies' volume,\" Buffett said. \"But good for society is what we're looking for.\"\n\nJain, who heads Berkshire's insurance operations, was skeptical.\n\n\"Tesla has been toying with the idea of writing insurance directly or indirectly, and so far it hasn't really been much of a success,\" Jain said. \"Time will tell, but I think automation just shifts a lot of the expense from the operator to the equipment provider.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the leadership transition at Berkshire, Buffett has already handed over much of the daily operations to Abel and Jain, making them the point people for most managers.\n\n\"This place, if anything happened to me, it would be working extremely well the next day. I don't get any phone calls,\" Buffett said.\n\nAbel, who serves as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and vice-chairman of non-insurance operations, is in line to succeed Buffett as CEO.\n\nWhen asked about investment possibilities in India, Buffett said investors will have to wait and see how the future management team plays the game. \"Fortunately, you don't have too long to wait on that,\" he joked, noting several times that he's slowing down.\n\n\"I shouldn't be taking on any four-year employment contracts like several people are doing in this world at an age where you can't be quite sure where you're going to be in four years,\" he said, in an apparent jab at President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, who are 81 and 77, respectively, as they face each other in a 2024 rematch campaign.\n\n\"I don't know anything about AI,\" Buffett quipped. He said likened the advent of artificial intelligence to his views on nuclear weapons, which he said last year are a dangerous genie that cannot be put back in the bottle.\n\nAI \"is part way out of the bottle, and it's enormously important and it's gonna be done by somebody,\" he said. \"We may wish we'd never seen that genie, or it may do wonderful things.\"\n\nHe said he has had one experience that makes him \"a little nervous\" about AI: seeing a video of him speaking that was generated by AI.\n\n\"I do think, as someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about about it, that it has enormous potential for good, and enormous potential for harm,\" he said. \"And I just don't know how that plays out.\"", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors":

Since taking control of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.56%) (BRK.B 0.07%) in 1965, he's grown the value of the business, including its investments, by a compound annual growth rate of 19.8%. That compares with the 10.2% compound total return of the S&P 500 index during that time. Anyone who invested in Berkshire instead of an average S&P 500 fund would have 140 times the amount of wealth today.\n\nIn recent years, Buffett has been hard-pressed to find a great company to buy. As Berkshire Hathaway grows larger, its operations spin off more cash, and Buffett has seen the company's cash pile grow faster than he can find good investments. His largest investment last year totaled $9.2 billion, while the company ended the year with $167.6 billion.\n\nIt's a good bet Buffett will continue to snatch up shares of the company this year, as he sees it as undervalued in today's market.\n\nAs mentioned, Buffett hasn't seen a whole lot to like in the stock market over the past year, so his new investments have been few and far between.\n\nOne stock that he consistently added to in 2023 and continues to buy in 2024, though, is Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.42%). The company holds a strong position in the Permian Basin, giving it access to some of the lowest-cost oil supply in the country. Berkshire Hathaway first invested in Occidental with the purchase of $10 billion in preferred shares in 2019 to support the oil company's purchase of Anadarko. Buffett has since taken a massive 28% stake in the company through its common stock, more than offsetting Occidental's retirement of his preferred shares over the past year. Still, Buffett's Occidental purchases in 2023 only added up to about $3 billion.\n\nThere's another company Buffett bought a significant stake in last year as well. However, we still don't know exactly what it is. While Berkshire Hathaway is typically required to disclose every position in its portfolio at the end of each quarter, it received a special exemption from the SEC for the last two quarters of 2023. As a result, we don't know exactly what Buffett's been purchasing.\n\nBut we do have some clues. First of all, the company appears to be a financial stock, based on Berkshire Hathaway's reported cost basis of \"banks, insurance, and finance\" equities. Second, Berkshire's financial disclosures indicate it invested over $5 billion in the stock in 2023. That means the company must be very large, considering Berkshire is required to disclose the company after amassing a 5% stake in the business. My colleague Sean Williams narrowed the field to just seven potential candidates, his best guess being Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Since Berkshire asked for the position to remain confidential, investors can bet he's planning to buy more in 2024.\n\nStill, both those investments pale in comparison to the amount Buffett spent on his largest purchase in 2023. Buffett spent $9.2 billion buying shares in one of his favorite stocks. His first purchase of the company's stock dates to 1962. Yes, Buffett's biggest stock purchase for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year was Berkshire Hathaway stock itself!\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's board of directors previously restricted Buffett's ability to buy back shares based on the stock's price-to-book-value ratio. If the ratio exceeded 1.2, Buffett couldn't buy back any shares of Berkshire Hathaway no matter how much he felt the market was undervaluing the stock.\n\nIn mid-2018, the board agreed to allow Buffett to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway as long as both he and late Vice Chairman Charlie Munger agreed the stock was priced below its intrinsic value based on a conservative estimate.\n\nSince Munger's passing, Buffett has become the sole determinant of the stock's intrinsic value. But investors shouldn't worry that he wields too much power. Buffett is adamant that management should never overpay to buy back its stock. He laid it out plainly in his most recent letter to shareholders: \"All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business value becomes stupid if done at a premium.\"\n\nWhat's more, Buffett holds about 99% of his wealth in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and he has many family members with significant amounts of their wealth in Berkshire stock. He only ever disposes of shares when he donates them to charity. His interests couldn't be more aligned with the rest of Berkshire's shareholders.\n\nNonetheless, Buffett has bought back shares of Berkshire Hathaway every quarter since the board authorized the change. That includes $9.2 billion worth last year.\n\nConsidering Berkshire Hathaway has been producing strong operating results from its wholly owned businesses, generating billions in free cash flow every quarter, it's very likely Buffett will continue to buy shares in 2024. Berkshire Hathaway stock currently trades for just 17.5 times forward earnings estimates. That's well below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 20.8. And when you consider the amount of cash on its balance sheet, that ratio looks even more appealing.\n\nSo Buffett would be more than justified in his continued repurchase of Berkshire Hathaway stock. We'll find out on Saturday, when Berkshire Hathaway releases its quarterly report, if Buffett bought more shares during the first three months of the year. And if you'd like a growing share of a company Buffett thinks is undervalued, you might consider adding some of the stock to your own portfolio.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_levy@fool.com", "name": "Adam Levy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Occidental Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preferred stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intrinsic value (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_UFJ_Financial_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/775389/buffett2-tmf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\n\"It's just fun to be a part of it,\" said Jeff Farmer, a 59-year-old public safety worker from Omaha, at an exhibit hall where Berkshire wares were for sale on Friday. \"We just want to hear that the company is on the same trajectory and hear about what they are forecasting for the future.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\n\"I want to hear from Greg Abel,\" said Min Zhuang, 51, who drove seven hours from Chicago to attend the meeting and has owned Berkshire shares for over a decade.\n\n\"I want to see what kind of person he is, what his vision is for the company and if it's different from Buffett's. I am not afraid of change.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy the $167.6 billion of cash on hand at year-end.\n\nThe shareholder meeting is also the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Warren to not have Charlie there,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, attending his 32nd Berkshire meeting.\n\nBerkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nIn the last year, Berkshire's stock is up 23%, trailing the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, Berkshire rose 218% compared with the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday on everything from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. \"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting.\n\n\"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\" Berkshire will on Saturday also release first-quarter results while shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six.

Shareholders and investors from across the world have gathered in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting is set to kick off in a few hours in Omaha, Nebraska. Shareholders and investors from across the world have gathered to hear Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett's wisdom, guidance, and advice, at the annual fest which has come to be known as the \"Woodstock for capitalists\".\n\nThe upcoming shareholder meeting (4 May 2024) will be the first without the presence of the late Charlie Munger, the former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and long-time associate of Warren Buffett.\n\nAt the meeting, Buffett, along with Vice Chairmen Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, will answer around 40-60 questions from shareholders over five hours.\n\nAlso Read | One wonderful business can offset many mediocre decisions, writes Warren Buffett\n\n\"The three of us will not get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know [the shareholders] will pick some tough ones and that's the way we like it,\" said Buffett in a note ahead of the meeting.\n\nWhat questions could be posed to the Chairman?\n\nShareholders will not be allowed to ask certain questions. Berkshire has requested shareholders to avoid raising questions on stocks being bought or sold. \"Even if the information is public, we do not discuss how we arrive at our decisions,\" said the company.\n\n1. Geopolitical events\n\nGiven the ongoing geopolitical tensions and global turmoil, Berkshire also informed shareholders that none of the panelists will discuss politics, but \"any other subjects are fair game.\" Nevertheless, these events will have an impact on the markets, so questions on Buffett's take regarding America's policy position are unlikely to be skipped.\n\n2. Apple and AI\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's largest holding is Apple, which accounts for around 45 percent of its portfolio, and is worth around $165 billion. With the fervor around artificial intelligence (AI) in the technology space, Buffett could be asked about his outlook on AI or machine learning and how it could drive growth for mega-cap technology firms.\n\nAlso Read | Warren Buffett's 7 gems on long-term investing: 'Favourite holding period is forever'\n\n3. Oil vs clean energy\n\nDespite the world moving towards clean energy, Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in major oil players Chevron and Occidental Petroleum in 2023. These two stocks account for the fifth and sixth largest holdings in Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett bought 15.8 million shares in Chevron during the quarter ended December and further purchased stock in Occidental Petroleum, to take its shareholding to 28 percent.\n\nSince stock-specific questions are prohibited, Buffett could be asked about the factors driving Berkshire's bullishness in oil-based energy, especially considering the evolving energy landscape and increasing concerns about climate change.\n\n4. Eyes on Japan\n\nAs Japan has set out on its recovery path, with its key index Nikkei 225 reclaiming 30-year highs, Warren Buffett has been bullish on the Japanese story. He owns stocks of five Japanese trading houses, Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. What caught his eye in Japan and what does he see as long-term growth drivers of the Japanese economy?\n\n5. Sparking out?\n\nAfter holding 9.9 percent in Chinese automaker BYD since 2008, Berkshire Hathaway cut its stake to less than 8 percent in 2023. With the EV story having soured because of weak demand and excess supply, Buffet could be asked about Berkshire's long-term strategy on sustainable energy, the auto-sector and rapidly declining US-China trade relations.\n\n6. Realty Bites\n\nBerkshire Hathaway took an uncharacteristically short-term bet on homebuilder D.R. Horton. Berkshire added the firm to its portfolio in the second quarter of 2023, only for it to be liquidated in the December quarter.\n\nGiven the tenuous situation for homebuyers in America with many buyers being priced out of becoming homeowners, Buffett could be asked for his opinion on the condition of mortgages, the outlook on the real estate space and why Berkshire made an exception from its strategy of long-term holdings.\n\n7. Buffett's Pearls of Wisdom\n\nHowever, apart from queries about specific sectors or business, the Oracle of Omaha is also often posed with questions regarding his general strategies and perspective, which are often met with his quintessential humor, life lessons, and wit.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Buffett said time and again he is no AI expert, at one point characterizing himself as someone who \"doesn't understand a damn thing about it.\"\n\nStill, Buffett analogized the advent of the AI boom to the discovery of the nuclear bomb on more than one occasion, saying these two technologies are proverbial genies that cannot be put back in the bottle.\n\nAs for the company's growing pile of cash and Treasury holdings, Buffett said it is likely the value of these holdings will exceed $200 billion during the current quarter, noting he's \"quite satisfied\" with the position.\n\nAsked about Berkshire's appetite for increasing investments overseas, and in China specifically, Buffett said, \"Our primary investments will always be in the United States.\"\n\nOn succession, Buffett said Abel should be in charge of directing Berkshire's investments after his passing. Abel is set to take over as Berkshire CEO after Buffett; investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler joined the company over a decade ago and have contributed to many changes within Berkshire's equity portfolio over those years.\n\nToward the end of the proceedings, Buffett spoke about Federal Reserve policy for the first time, suggesting to shareholders that the US government's accumulated deficit garners more of his attention than Fed policy.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Q&A session, Buffett left the audience with a last bit of wit -- \"I not only hope that you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39 per cent to USD 11.222 billion from last year's USD 8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of USD 6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nAlso Read | Layoffs 2024: Reader's Digest Shutting Down Its Operations in UK After 86 Years, Permanently Laying Off 500 Employees, Says Report.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly USD 6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13 per cent of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the USD 364 billion portfolio at USD 135.4 billion, and Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years -- even up to when his successor takes over.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a USD 2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from USD 911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8 per cent to USD 1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72 per cent jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added USD 717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5 per cent to USD 89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted USD 87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record USD 188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent USD 2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nTHOUSANDS ATTEND WARREN BUFFETT'S WOODSTOCK FOR CAPITALISTS'\n\nTens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute to Munger recounting his life and highlighting some of his best known quotes from the meetings over the years that drew applause, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured old interviews with Buffett and Munger talking about their epic friendship.\n\nThe video also featured several of the classic skits the investors made for meetings over the years with holiday stars like a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another video where Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over Munger.\n\nAs the video ended, everyone in the arena gave Munger a prolonged standing ovation to thank him for being what Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80 per cent of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nMEETING THE NEXT GENERATION OF BERKSHIRE LEADERS\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO. Abel and Jain are sharing the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year in the spot Munger used to occupy.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" out of habit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humour at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing\n\nOMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) -Warren Buffett will take center stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday as shareholders, some having traveled long distances, arrived to see the famed investor as well as his expected successor.\n\nThe meeting is the 60th for Buffett, 93, since he took over Berkshire in 1965. He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Berkshire reported first-quarter earnings that showed that its cash pile swelled to $189 billion as of March 31 while the size of its stake in Apple fell. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appeared to have sold 13% of its Apple shares in the quarter.\n\nBuffett has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Apple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience at the meeting on Saturday.\n\nIn downtown Omaha, hundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Warren to not have Charlie there,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, attending his 32nd Berkshire meeting.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND Berkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. \"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\" Berkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six. The weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession. \"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Scott Morgan; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia Osterman, Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Here are four key takeaways from the extensive question-and-answer portion of the annual shareholder event.\n\nFor about 60 years, shareholders have made the annual pilgrimage to Omaha, Nebraska to hear directly from the \"odd couple\" who built the company into the multi-billion-dollar conglomerate it is today.\n\nThis year's shareholders meeting was markedly different without Charlie Munger, Buffett's long-time business partner who died in November at age 99. Munger, who used to sit next to Warren on the stage, was always ready with a one-liner to solidify Buffett's point, answer shareholder questions or dispense witty bits of wisdom.\n\nThe annual movie that kicked off the meeting focused on those quips this year, showing Munger throughout the years making jokes or snarking about business as Buffett laughed by his side.\n\nSeated next to Buffett this year, vice chairs Ajit Jain, the head of Berkshire's insurance businesses, and Greg Abel, who runs all non-insurance businesses, were loathe to upstage Buffett. The pair mostly focused on facts and figures behind their respective operations.\n\nBuffett mentioned Munger extensively throughout the day and the crowd chuckled during a bittersweet moment when he handed a question off to Charlie Munger out of habit, meaning to give Abel a chance to speak.\n\nIn light of Munger's passing, many investors asked questions about the company's succession plans.\n\nBuffett alluded several times throughout the meeting to Abel taking over the company after the CEO's death. Abel became vice chairmen of the company in 2018 alongside Jain, and the pair have taken on a larger, more public role over the past few years.\n\n\"We've really got the problem solved for the next 20 years unless something untoward happens,\" he said.\n\nSuccession is important to shareholders because Buffett and Munger were known for a particular brand of business savvy and partnership. Many are seemingly searching for signs the company can maintain its success after Buffett dies. Buffett, for his part, answered most questions about succession by saying executives and the board will decide on the details when the time comes.\n\nThat being said, Buffett touched on who he thinks will replace Jain (\"We won't find another Ajit, but we have an operation that he has created\"), and who will pick stocks once he's gone (\"[Greg] understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks.\")\n\nIn the hours before the meeting, Berkshire Hathaway released its first-quarter earnings report, showing a large cash hoard.\n\nAccording to the first-quarter filing released this morning, the company holds $36 billion in cash and $153 billion in Treasurys, for a total cash hoard of $189 billion. That's much higher than at the same time last year when the company had $130 billion in that stockpile.\n\nShareholders wanted to know how Buffett plans to deploy the capital and his response was frank.\n\n\"I don't think anybody's sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively and therefore we don't,\" he said. \"...We only swing at pitches we like.\"\n\nBuffett noted during his presentation of the company's earnings that its cash position, excluding the amount held by the railroad, utility and energy businesses, stood at $182 billion at the end of the last quarter. He said it's \"a fair assumption\" that the the number will rise to about $200 billion at the end of the second quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" he said.\n\nThe earnings report also revealed Berkshire significantly cut its stock holdings in Apple (AAPL).\n\nBased on the value of holdings cited in its quarterly report, Berkshire cut the amount of shares it is holding by about 13%. That's a bigger reduction than in the previous quarter and equates to about 116 million fewer shares.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway investors grabbed onto the decline, but Buffett dismissed the notion that it was because his views on the iPhone maker have changed.\n\n\"We will end up -- unless something dramatically happens that really changes capital allocation strategy -- we will have Apple as our largest investment, but I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position,\" Buffett said.\n\nEven with the cut, Apple remains the conglomerate's largest stock holding, and Berkshire is still the tech giant's single largest shareholder.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munger", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investopedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investopedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/0Qt5PDMQy9ivCgOtnAcipZGgFJs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2150879457-236e72cf69214c0cb768d77a60fd2e2a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

And that's not going to change.\"\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session, Buffett mistakenly referred to Abel as the late business titan Munger, which drew laughs from the audience. \"I'm so used to that,\" Buffett acknowledged, admitting that he'd probably \"slip again\".

Operating earnings also rose, buoyed by his collection of insurance businesses.\n\nThe firm's hoard increased to US$189 billion at the end of the first quarter, topping the record it set at year-end. The company also reported first-quarter operating earnings of US$11.2 billion, versus US$8.07 billion for the same period a year earlier.\n\nBuffett, 93, has long decried a lack of meaningful deals that would give the firm a shot at \"eye-popping\" results. Even as the company ramped up acquisitions over the past few years, including a US$11.6 billion deal to buy Alleghany Corp and its purchase of shares in Occidental Petroleum Corp, Berkshire has struggled to find sizable deals. That has left Buffett with more cash -- what he called an unrivaled mountain of capital -- than he and his investing deputies could quickly deploy.\n\nAs Berkshire's annual meeting launched in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday, Buffett said that \"it's a fair assumption\" that its cash pile would hit US$200 billion at the end of this quarter with few opportunities for needle-moving acquisitions on the horizon.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" he told the crowd of thousands.\n\nThe company hopes for an \"occasional big opportunity,\" he added, later saying that it is looking at an investment in Canada.\n\nStill, having such a vast sum of cash in an increasingly \"complicated and intertwined\" world where more can go wrong could allow the firm to step in when opportunities present themselves, Buffett said.\n\nBerkshire wants to be ready to act when that happens, he said.\n\nThe company sold some of its Apple Inc shares in the quarter, reporting a US$135.4 billion stake at the end of March, down from US$174.3 billion at the end of last year. Apple has been hit by a drumbeat of negative news, including a US$2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project.\n\nDespite the sale, Buffett praised Apple, saying it is an \"even better\" business than two others it owns shares in -- American Express Co and Coca-Cola Co.\n\nApple would likely remain its top holding by the end of the year, Buffett said.\n\nBerkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment.\n\nThe company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is the subject of takeover talks.\n\nIn the absence of deals, Berkshire has turned to buying back its own shares. It spent about US$2.6 billion doing that in the first quarter, the company said in its earnings statement on Saturday.\n\nWith businesses including railroad, retail, construction and energy, Berkshire is closely watched as a litmus test for US economic health, particularly amid elevated inflation and interest rates.\n\nEarnings at the company's collection of insurance businesses jumped to US$2.6 billion, compared with US$911 million in the same period last year, thanks to improved results at its vehicle insurer Geico Corp, fewer catastrophes and an increase in insurance investment income. The conglomerate's BNSF Railway Co reported an 8.3 percent decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to \"unfavorable changes in business mix,\" as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nBerkshire reported US$12.7 billion in earnings attributable to shareholders for the first quarter, compared with US$35.5 billion for the same period a year earlier, largely due to lower investment income.\n\nBuffett advised shareholders against relying on the firm's net income figures because they include the swings of its stock portfolio value and do not reflect the performance of its vast group of businesses.\n\nBerkshire's annual meeting drew thousands of Buffett devotees. It is the first without Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman and Buffett's long-time investing partner, who died at the age of 99 in November last year.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occidental Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GEICO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Coca-Cola Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNSF_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BNSF Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2024/05/06/P12-240506-312.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Abel has been overseeing a major portion of Berkshire's sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail.\n\nBuffett offered the clearest insight into his succession plan to date after years of speculation about the exact roles of Berkshire's top executives after the eventual transition. The investing icon, who's turning 94 in August, said his decision is influenced by how much Berkshire's assets have grown.\n\n\"I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think that responsibility should be that of the CEO and whatever that CEO decides may be helpful,\" Buffett said. \"The sums have grown so large at Berkshire, and we do not want to try and have 200 people around that are managing a billion each. It just doesn't work.\"\n\nBerkshire's cash pile ballooned to nearly $189 billion at the end of March, while its gigantic equity portfolio has stocks worth a whopping $362 billion based on current market prices.\n\n\"I think what you're handling the sums that we will have, you've got to think very strategically about how to do very big things,\" Buffett added. \"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg.\"\n\nWhile Buffett has made clear that Abel would be taking over the CEO job, there were still questions about who would control the Berkshire public stock portfolio, where Buffett has garnered a huge following by racking up huge returns through investments in the likes of Coca-Cola and Apple.\n\nBerkshire investing managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, both former hedge fund managers, have helped Buffett manage a small portion of the stock portfolio (about 10%) for about the last decade. There was speculation that they may take over that portion of the Berkshire CEO role when he is no longer able.\n\nBut it seems, based on Buffett's latest comments, that Abel will have final decisions on all capital allocation -- including stock picks.\n\n\"I think the chief executive should be somebody that can weigh buying businesses, buying stocks, doing all kinds of things that might come up at a time when nobody else is willing to move,\" Buffett said.\n\nAbel is known for his strong expertise in the energy industry. Berkshire acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999 and Abel became CEO of the company in 2008, six years before it was renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 2014.\n\nCorrection: Berkshire's equity portfolio is worth $362 billion. A previous version misstated the figure.\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Weschler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Weschler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MidAmerican_Energy_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MidAmerican Energy Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1714906574_Warren-Buffett-says-Greg-Abel-will-make-Berkshire-Hathaway-investing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Buffett said time and again he is no AI expert, at one point characterizing himself as someone who \"doesn't understand a damn thing about it.\"\n\nStill, Buffett analogized the advent of the AI boom to the discovery of the nuclear bomb on more than one occasion, saying these two technologies are proverbial genies that cannot be put back in the bottle.\n\nAs for the company's growing pile of cash and Treasury holdings, Buffett said it is likely the value of these holdings exceeds $200 billion during the current quarter, noting he's \"quite satisfied\" with the position.\n\nAsked about Berkshire's appetite for increasing investments overseas, and in China specifically, Buffett said, \"Our primary investments will always be in the United States.\"\n\nOn succession, Buffett said Abel should be in charge of directing Berkshire's investments after his passing. Abel is set to take over as Berkshire CEO after Buffett; investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler joined the company over a decade ago and have contributed to many changes within Berkshire's equity portfolio over those years.\n\nTowards the end of the proceedings, Buffett spoke about Federal Reserve policy for the first time, suggesting to shareholders the US government's accumulated deficit garners more of his attention than Fed policy.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Q&A session, Buffett left the audience with a last bit of wit -- \"I not only hope that you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\"\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

And he's seen how - Breitbart", "body": "Warren Buffett has come face to face with the downside of AI\n\nWarren Buffett says AI may be better for scammers than society. And he's seen howBy JOSH FUNKAP Business WriterThe Associated PressOMAHA, Neb.\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nEARNINGS BEFORE MUSINGS\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA NOTABLE ABSENCE\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nNEXT GEN LEADERS\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nAbel offered a twist on Munger's classic \"I have nothing to add\" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying \"The only thing I would add.\"\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nA LOOK TO THE FUTURE\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\"\n\n___\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated the company reported a profit equaling \"$8.825 per Class A share\". The correct figure is \"$8,825 per Class A share\". ___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

Berkshire reported a USD 12.7 billion profit, or USD 8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of the USD 35.5 billion, or USD 24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39 per cent to USD 11.222 billion from last year's USD 8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nThe three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted operating earnings of USD 6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett did sell off nearly USD 6 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13 per cent of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. The investment in the iPhone maker is still the biggest one in the USD 364 billion portfolio at USD 135.4 billion, and Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years -- even up to when his successor takes over.\n\nBut the estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests that Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the iPhone and other Apple products.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a USD 2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from USD 911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits did disappoint and drop 8 per cent to USD 1.143 billion, but most of its many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72 per cent jump in operating profits at the utility unit that added USD 717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew 5 per cent to USD 89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted USD 87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record USD 188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent USD 2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nTHOUSANDS ATTEND WARREN BUFFETT'S WOODSTOCK FOR CAPITALISTS' Tens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting Woodstock for Capitalists.' But a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute to Munger recounting his life and highlighting some of his best known quotes from the meetings over the years that drew applause, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured old interviews with Buffett and Munger talking about their epic friendship.\n\nThe video also featured several of the classic skits the investors made for meetings over the years with holiday stars like a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another video where Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over Munger.\n\nAs the video ended, everyone in the arena gave Munger a prolonged standing ovation to thank him for being what Buffett called ''the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\" He and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well. \"Warren always did at least 80 per cent of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nMEETING THE NEXT GENERATION OF BERKSHIRE LEADERS That absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO. Abel and Jain are sharing the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year in the spot Munger used to occupy.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" out of habit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. ''The bench is deep. He won't have the same humour at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Let me know: harriet.agnew@ft.com\n\nThis week I bring you a special edition of the newsletter: Berkshire after Buffett. In a series of pieces, led by my colleague and longtime Berkshire Hathaway watcher Eric Platt, the FT examines the conglomerate's rich success under Warren Buffett and the challenges that will eventually face the company's next generation of leaders.\n\nEric was in Nebraska for Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, dubbed the Woodstock of capitalism. The Omaha gathering had a particular poignancy, being the first time Buffett took to the stage since the death of his longtime investment partner Charlie Munger, who passed away in November at the age of 99. His death has intensified questions over the future of the business when Buffett, 93, is no longer at the helm.\n\nAt the start, the legendary investor mistakenly referred to his successor Greg Abel as \"Charlie\" when passing a question to him. The packed arena -- so full that hundreds of people sat behind the stage, unable to see Buffett in the flesh -- broke into a thunderous applause. \"I'm so used to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.,\" he said, before laughing. \"I checked myself a couple times already. I'll slip again.\"\n\nAt the AGM on Saturday, Buffett gave his most direct answer yet on how responsibilities will be doled out among the small executive team that will one day lead the company, handing Abel responsibility for how hundreds of billions of dollars are allocated. \"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg,\" Buffett said from the stage at the CHI Health Center in downtown Omaha. \"I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think that the responsibility should be that of the CEO.\"\n\nWhile Buffett made clear that Abel will have authority over not just takeovers but the sprawling conglomerate's mammoth stock portfolio as well, two other lieutenants -- Ted Weschler and Todd Combs -- are expected to play a prominent role within Berkshire's $354bn equity portfolio.\n\nBerkshire is the last great American conglomerate, with hundreds of subsidiaries fused with the backbone of the US economy. Its freight trains run over more than 32,000 miles of track. Its utilities provide power to 13mn customers and in Geico it owns one of the largest insurers in the country.\n\nCombs and Weschler were plucked from relative obscurity to help run this portfolio. Weschler, 61, was hired after twice paying millions of dollars at charity auctions for lunch with Buffett in 2010 and 2011, and Combs, 53, was recruited in 2010 after writing to Munger, asking to meet him.\n\nThe FT set out to address the biggest questions confronting Berkshire shareholders as they imagine a future without Buffett: how do Weschler and Combs approach investing, are they any good, and can they build on his astonishing record?\n\nThe analysis found that Buffett's deputies are trailing both their mentor and the market.\n\nIn early 2023, Ajit Jain was weighing Berkshire's exposure to the risk of a devastating hurricane hitting Florida.\n\nIf its insurance business provided more cover and the upcoming season proved tame, Berkshire would reap a multibillion-dollar windfall. The downside? A potential $15bn in losses if it turned into an ugly year for natural catastrophes. Jain sought permission from his boss, Warren Buffett, to increase the bet.\n\n\"Warren said yes without even listening to what the numbers were,\" Jain recounted to shareholders at Berkshire's annual meeting last year. With the season ending up a mild one, the decision helped propel the insurance business to one of the best underwriting profits in its history.\n\nThe 72-year-old Jain heads the insurance operations that underpin Berkshire, providing the cheap capital that has allowed Buffett to build a conglomerate spanning businesses from Duracell batteries to railroad operator BNSF and one of the biggest investors in the US stock market.\n\nIn this article, Eric and Ian Smith examine Berkshire's insurance business, drawing on accounts of current and former employees, competitors and advisers.\n\nWhen Berkshire announced the acquisition of MidAmerican Energy in 1999, Buffett hailed the Iowa gas and electric utility as squarely in the conglomerate's \"sweet spot\".\n\nUnheralded at the time, the $2bn transaction catapulted Buffett into the energy business, kicking off a quarter of a century of dealmaking that has transformed Berkshire into a major player, operating across 28 states, transporting 15 per cent of America's natural gas and serving 13mn customers.\n\nThe $138bn of assets owned by its subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, are varied, but the appeal of the businesses -- and their place within Berkshire -- have gone unquestioned. Its utilities, accounting for the bulk of BHE's assets, boast the economic moats against competition prized by Buffett and have long been an attractive home for the cash that the conglomerate generates.\n\nBut if predictability was hardcoded into the sector's DNA 25 years ago, global warming is bringing epochal change. The threats confronting Berkshire are multipronged: from billions of dollars in potential damages from wildfires, to criticism over how quickly it plans to retire its coal-fired power stations and the increasing politicisation of climate change in the US.\n\nIn this article, Myles McCormick and Eric explore how the energy division arguably faces the most fundamental upheaval of any part of the Berkshire empire.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Greg Abel, then a high-flying energy industry executive, lived just a few blocks from Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska, the home of Berkshire.\n\nThe pair never met at the time, but three decades later Abel is in line to eventually succeed him at the top of Berkshire, handing the plain-speaking Canadian a challenge even more daunting than the one Tim Cook faced when he took the reins at Apple from Steve Jobs.\n\nBuffett's longevity means putative successors have either died or fallen by the wayside. But Buffett's advancing years and the death of Berkshire's acerbic vice-chair Munger means that the question of what the future holds when the legendary investor is no longer in charge is an ever more pressing one.\n\nIn the final part of the series, Eric explores whether Abel will be able to deliver on Buffett's promise that Berkshire, America's last great conglomerate in an age when they have fallen out of favour, was really built to outlast a founder whose investment record, folksy charm and professorial wisdom have made him the country's most admired business leader.\n\nAbel will be tested on multiple fronts. The 61-year-old will have to show he can allocate the nearly $10bn that flows from Berkshire's operating businesses into Omaha each quarter just as the task of unearthing acquisitions, both big and at a good value to make a difference to the $862bn company, becomes harder.\n\nAt the same time, he will have to navigate a board which includes two of Buffett's children, Howard and Susie, as well as executives such as Jain, who has for years reported directly to the billionaire.\n\nThe figure underscores the difficulty the billionaire investor and his team have had in trying to find worthwhile investments, as well as the relative allure of the high yield on US government debt, Eric reports from Omaha.\n\nThe company on Saturday disclosed it had sold just under $20bn worth of stocks in the first three months of the year, buying $2.7bn over the same period. As a result the value of its stock portfolio slipped to $336bn, from $354bn at year-end.\n\nThe filing with US securities regulators indicated that Berkshire had sold a significant portion of its stake in Apple, which had become a core holding for the Omaha-based business since one of Buffett's deputies first invested in 2016.\n\nThe company said its position in the iPhone maker was worth $135.4bn in the first quarter, down from $174.3bn at the end of 2023, indicating it had sold roughly 115mn shares in the company at the start of the year, or 13 per cent of its holdings. Berkshire started to pare its holdings in Apple in late December, selling roughly 10mn shares.\n\nUS active asset managers are getting left behind as investors tiptoe back into the markets via index tracking funds. Active mutual funds experienced outflows of more than $50bn in the first three months of the year, according to Morningstar Direct, hurting large asset managers such as Capital Group, T Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton. Instead, investors are focusing on strategies that track an index over those that select stocks, particularly exchange traded funds.\n\nJeremy Hunt has warned the Financial Conduct Authority against its plan to \"name and shame\" companies under investigation in an unusual broadside against the UK's top financial regulator. \"I hope the FCA re-look at their decision,\" the UK chancellor told the Financial Times, referring to the watchdog's plan to publicly disclose the identities of companies under investigation more frequently and at a much earlier stage.\n\nBlackRock has struck a deal with the Saudi Arabian government to open a multi-class investment firm in Riyadh, anchored by a $5bn mandate from the kingdom's Public Investment Fund. BlackRock Riyadh Investment Management will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the $10.5tn US asset manager. The goal is to attract additional overseas capital to Saudi Arabia and deepen its capital markets through a range of investment funds managed by BlackRock.\n\nBillionaire Michael Platt's BlueCrest Capital is planning to expand its number of trading teams by 10 per cent by the end of the year after a run of performance in which the family office has trounced many of its macro hedge fund rivals. The secretive investment firm is in talks with 30 portfolio managers across the industry, as a war for talent rages with multi-manager hedge funds such as Citadel and Millennium.\n\nMarc Lipschultz, the co-founder of Blue Owl, one of Wall Street's largest alternative asset managers, said it was planning to keep pursuing acquisitions to expand beyond its core business of arranging financing for other private equity groups. The New York-based investment group is considering acquiring an infrastructure investor or a lender with a focus on originating securitised debts backed by assets such as aircraft or rental equipment.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Combs", "type": "person", "score":

Buffett's company also posted a record operating profit exceeding $11 billion, as its insurance operations benefited from improved underwriting and higher income from investments as interest rates rose. The value of Berkshire's stake in Apple fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, even though the iPhone maker's share price fell just 11% in the quarter. Based on changes in Apple's stock price, Berkshire appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings, in the quarter, ending with about 790 million. A large sale is an about-face for Buffett, who is normally tech-phobic but came to view Apple as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers. Some investors, however, have expressed concern that Apple consumed too much of Berkshire's investment portfolio. But the sales leave Buffett with more than six times the minimum $30 billion cash cushion he has pledged to keep. At Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett assured shareholders that \"unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\" He also said \"I don't mind\" expanding the cash stake, in light of alternatives in the equity markets and conflicts around the world, and said cash could top $200 billion by the end of June. The Apple sales resulted in Berkshire's realizing $11.2 billion of after-tax gains in the quarter from selling investments. Buffett maintained that he doesn't mind paying taxes. First-quarter operating profit rose 39% to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier. \"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said in a research note. Net income fell 64% to $12.7 billion, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks. An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report those gains with its financial results. Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility. Berkshire also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, and a small amount in the first three weeks of April. The results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city. Buffett, 93, has led Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate whose dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Dairy Queen and See's Candies. The diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry. Insurance profit soared 80% to $5.2 billion. This included a more than doubling of underwriting profit at Geico, which benefited from rate increases and a large decline in the percentage of premiums it used to pay for accident losses. Profit fell 8% at the BNSF railroad, in part because of lower fuel surcharges and an \"unfavorable business mix.\" Berkshire Hathaway Energy saw profit rise 72%, as improved operating performance from utilities helped offset rising legal costs at the HomeServices of America real estate brokerage related to legal settlements over brokerage commissions. The energy business still faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "thedailyherald.sx", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

And he's seen how - WVUA 23", "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nAbel offered a twist on Munger's classic \"I have nothing to add\" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying \"The only thing I would add.\"\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\"\n\n___\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated the company reported a profit equaling \"$8.825 per Class A share\". The correct figure is \"$8,825 per Class A share\". ___", "source": {"uri": "wvua23.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WVUA23"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Berkshire realized $11.2 billion of after-tax gains in the quarter from selling investments.\n\nPROFIT SWELLS\n\nFirst-quarter operating profit rose 39 per cent to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.\n\nNet income fell 64 per cent to $12.7 billion, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks.\n\nAn accounting rule requires Berkshire to report those gains with its financial results. Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.\n\nBerkshire also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock in the first quarter, and a small amount in the first three weeks of April.\n\nThe results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.\n\nBuffett, 93, has led Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate whose dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Dairy Queen and See's Candies.\n\nThe diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.\n\nGEICO HELPS POWER EARNINGS\n\nInsurance profit soared 80 per cent to $5.2 billion. This included a more than doubling of underwriting profit at Geico, which benefited from rate increases and a large decline in the percentage of premiums it used to pay for accident losses.\n\nProfit fell 8 per cent at the BNSF railroad, in part because of lower fuel surcharges and an \"unfavorable business mix.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy saw profit rise 72 per cent, as improved operating performance from utilities helped offset rising legal costs at the HomeServices of America real estate brokerage related to a nationwide settlement over brokerage commissions.\n\nThe energy business still faces billions of dollars in claims against its PacifiCorp unit over Oregon wildfires in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [],

Buffett always turned to Munger for his often-amusing two cents' worth.\n\nBut there was no Munger on Saturday. And that moment served as another reminder of how much Berkshire's irascible vice chairman will be missed.\n\nMunger, who died in November at age 99, was fondly remembered as Berkshire's shareholders again filled the CHI Health Center to hear the Oracle of Omaha expound on business, capitalism and the principles behind Berkshire's long run of business success.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That included when one young shareholder asked Buffett what he would do if he could spend one more day with Munger -- a question that sent Buffett down memory lane.\n\nHe said they enjoyed playing golf and tennis together in their younger days but said they had just as much fun, and perhaps more, when they experienced business failings.\n\n\"In a sense, there's more fun having somebody who is your partner and digging your way out of a hole,\" he said. \"If I had another day with him, we probably would do the same things we did in the early days.\"\n\nHe said there was a time when he talked with Munger almost every day. He found remarkable that there was never a time they were mad at each other. He said it was amazing that Munger seemed to peak in life at age 99, never more popular.\n\nIn the end, in the wake of the loss of his dear friend, Buffett advised those listening to figure out who they like to spend time with and spend as much time with them as possible.\n\n\"Why wait until the last day?\" he said.\n\nInstead of Munger sitting at Buffett's side Saturday, it was Abel, Berkshire's CEO-in-waiting. Ajit Jain also sat on the stage in the morning. For years, Jain and Abel have served as Berkshire's vice chairmen in charge of business operations.\n\nDuring the five-hour Q&A session, shareholders heard more from Abel and Jain than ever before.\n\nAt one point, Abel paid homage to his predecessor by repeating one of Munger's most anticipated replies.\n\n\"I'm going to have to use it,\" Abel said, after Buffett referred a question to him. \"'I have nothing to add.'\"\n\nBuffett feels fine at 93 but knows 'a little about actuarial tables'\n\nWhen asked to name his most trusted advisers today, Buffett again invoked Munger's memory.\n\n\"In terms of managing money, there wasn't anybody better to talk to for many, many decisions than Charlie,\" Buffett said.\n\nBut Buffett also expressed confidence in his own investment decision-making.\n\n\"In some respect, I talk to myself on investments,\" he said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDuring the movie, Buffett remarked on how close he and Munger were, saying they were \"like twins separated at birth and reunited.\" At the end, Buffett said of Berkshire: \"It lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nOf course, just how long Buffett will continue to sit on the stage -- he turns 94 in August -- is always on shareholders' minds. He indicated Saturday he feels fine but added, \"I do know a little about actuarial tables.\"\n\nOne shareholder asked what will happen when Jain is gone. Jain has led the insurance operations that are in many ways the backbone of Berkshire for years.\n\n\"We won't find another Ajit,\" Buffett said. \"I hope you have to worry a little bit about me before you worry about Ajit.\"\n\nBuffett noted Berkshire's cash holdings -- now a record $189 billion -- that have continued to grow mainly because Buffett has not been able to find a suitable acquisition target large enough to \"move the needle.\"\n\n\"We only swing at pitches we like,\" he said. He also said the cash leaves Berkshire in position to strike if there's a \"big opportunity.\"\n\nThe quarterly report Berkshire issued earlier in the day revealed the company had sold about 13% of its shares of Apple stock.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that Berkshire \"sold a little Apple this year,\" but he downplayed the significance of it, suggesting there were tax reasons behind the sale. He said that Apple is and likely will continue to be Berkshire's largest stock holding.\n\nBerkshire's utilities draw protest from climate activists\n\nBuffett and Abel defended Berkshire's electric utilities for continuing to invest in new generating plants powered by natural gas, a fossil fuel, in the face of global climate concerns. A group of protesters gathered across 10th Street from the CHI Health Center to criticize Berkshire's utility operations.\n\nAbel said he took pride that on last month's Earth Day, all of the energy needs of Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy were met with wind.\n\nBut because solar and wind can be intermittent, natural gas units are required to \"fill the gap,\" he said. Until battery technology improves enough to let utilities to store renewable energy until it's needed, he said, gas will be needed for reliability.\n\nAdded Buffett: \"We have some very smart people working on it, but it's not something you can do overnight. I understand why people want it overnight.\"\n\nBuffett also talked about his fears about the potential for fraud using artificial intelligence.\n\nBuffett said he recently saw an artificially-created video that depicted him saying something he definitely didn't say, yet even his wife or daughter could not have been able to tell that it wasn't him. The video was so convincing, he said, that \"I would probably send money to myself in some crazy country.\"\n\n\"Scamming has always been part of the American scene, but ... if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the industry of all time,\" he said.\n\nHe likened AI to nuclear weapons, saying once the genie is out of the bottle, he's not sure it can be put back in.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm,\" he said.\n\nShareholder Hriday Nayak, a college junior from Philadelphia, \"absolutely loved\" his first Berkshire meeting. He said he left feeling confident about the ability of Abel and Jain to lead Berkshire after Buffett.\n\n\"I think you can tell that they believe as strongly as Warren and Charlie do about Berkshire Hathaway, and they seem like good stewards going forward,\" he said.\n\nHe appreciated the investment wisdom, such as being patient, finding good managers to partner with, and not having to \"swing at every investment pitch.\"\n\nJeffrey Hill, an Omaha shareholder, especially enjoyed when the Q&A session turned to questions about life.\n\n\"How you live your life can help you with happiness and fulfillment and making money,\" he said. \"Because if you waste time on the wrong things, you're wasting this short amount of time we have.\"\n\nBuffett received a long standing ovation at the end of the meeting when he thanked shareholders for coming.\n\n\"I not only hope that you come next year,\" he said, \"but I hope that I come next year.\"\n\nPhotos: 2024 Berkshire Hathaway Annual

And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nWarren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nEarnings before musings\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA notable absence\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nNext gen leaders\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nAbel offered a twist on Munger's classic \"I have nothing to add\" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying \"The only thing I would add.\"\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nA look to the future\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\"", "source": {"uri":

Operating earnings also rose, buoyed by his collection of insurance businesses.\n\nThe firm's hoard increased to $189 billion at the end of the first quarter, topping the record it set at year-end. The company also reported first-quarter operating earnings of $11.2 billion, versus $8.07 billion for the same period a year earlier.\n\nBuffett, 93, has long decried a lack of meaningful deals that he said would give the firm a shot at \"\" results. Even as the company ramped up acquisitions in recent years, including an $11.6 billion deal to buy Alleghany Corp. and its purchase of shares in Occidental Petroleum Corp., Berkshire has struggled to find sizable deals. That's left Buffett with more cash -- what he called an unrivaled mountain of capital -- than he and his investing deputies could quickly deploy.\n\nAs Berkshire's annual meeting kicked off in Omaha on Saturday, Buffett said that \"it's a fair assumption\" that its cash pile will hit $200 billion at end of this quarter with few opportunities for needle-moving acquisitions on the horizon.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" he told the crowd of thousands. The company hopes for an \"occasional big opportunity,\" he added, later noting that it's looking at an investment in Canada.\n\nStill, having such a vast sum of cash in an increasingly \"complicated and intertwined\" world where more can go wrong can allow the firm to step in when opportunities present themselves, Buffett said. Berkshire wants to be ready to act when that happens, he said.\n\nThe company sold some of its Apple Inc. shares in the quarter, reporting a $135.4 billion stake at the end of March, down from $174.3 billion at the end of the year. Apple has been hit by a drumbeat of negative news, including a $2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project.\n\nDespite the sale, Buffett praised Apple, saying it's an \"even better\" business than two others it owns shares in -- American Express and Coca-Cola. Apple will likely remain its top holding by the year-end, Buffett said. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive officer, was in the audience.\n\nBerkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment. The company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is currently the subject of\n\nIn the absence of deals, Berkshire has turned to buying back its own shares. It spent about $2.6 billion doing that in the first quarter, it said in its earnings statement Saturday.\n\nStill, Berkshire's giant cash pile has been a beneficiary of higher interest rates, which helped drive up interest and other investment income to $1.9 billion, from $1.1 billion in the first quarter of last year.\n\n\"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. \"Rising rates are enabling Berkshire's still considerable cash balance to once again earn a competitive return.\"\n\nBerkshire's earnings rose despite Buffett's warning in May last year that profits at most of its operations would fall in 2023 as an \"incredible period\" for the US economy draws to an end. With including railroad, retail, construction and energy, Berkshire is closely watched as a litmus test for US economic health, particularly amid elevated inflation and interest rates.\n\nEarnings at its collection of insurance businesses jumped to $2.6 billion, versus $911 million in the same period last year, thanks to improved results at its auto insurer Geico, fewer catastrophes and an increase in insurance investment income. The conglomerate's railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3% decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to \"unfavorable changes in business mix\" as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nBerkshire reported $12.7 billion in earnings attributable to shareholders for the first quarter, compared to $35.5 billion for the same period a year ago, largely due to lower investment income. Buffett typically advises shareholders against relying on the firm's net income figures because they include the swings of its stock portfolio value and don't reflect performance of its vast group of businesses.\n\nBerkshire's annual meeting drew thousands of Buffett devotees.

But this year's meeting felt different.\n\nLongtime vice chairman Charlie Munger passed away in late November. His wry sense of humor, witty aphorisms, and entertaining rapport with Buffett were missed dearly. But there were other noticeable differences between this meeting and those of past years -- namely, a sense of caution.\n\nLet's dive into the key takeaways from the meeting and how it could influence what Berkshire does next.\n\nThe elephant in the room was Berkshire's decision to trim its stake in Apple (AAPL 5.98%) during the first quarter. Berkshire sold over 116 million shares of Apple in Q1, reducing its position by around 12.9%. It marks the company's largest sale of Apple stock since it began purchasing shares in 2016 -- far larger than the 10 million or so shares Berkshire sold in Q4.\n\nBuffett addressed the sale with the first answer in the Q&A session: \"Unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation and strategy, we will have Apple as our largest investment. But I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternatives of what's available in equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\"\n\nIn addition to valuation concerns, market conditions, and wanting to build up the cash position, Buffett also mentioned the federal rate on capital gains, which Buffett said is 21% compared to 35% not long ago and even as high as 52% in the past. Fears that the tax rate could go up based on fiscal policies and a need to cut the federal deficit is another reason why Buffett and his team decided to book gains on Apple stock now instead of risking a potentially higher tax rate in the future.\n\nBuffett has long spoken about the faith Berkshire shareholders entrust in him and his team to safeguard and grow their wealth. Berkshire is known for being fairly risk-averse, gravitating toward businesses with stable cash flows like insurance, railroads, utilities, and top brands like Coca-Cola (KO 0.29%), American Express (AXP -0.74%), and Apple. Another asset Berkshire loves is cash.\n\nBerkshire's cash and U.S. treasury position reached $182.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $163.3 billion at the end of 2023. Buffett said he expects the cash position to exceed $200 billion by the end of the second quarter.\n\nYou may think Berkshire is stockpiling cash because of higher interest rates and a better return on risk-free assets. But shortly before the lunch break, Buffett said that Berkshire would still be heavily in cash even if interest rates were 1% because Berkshire only swings at pitches it likes, and it won't swing at a pitch simply because it hasn't in a while. \"It's just that things aren't attractive, and there are certain ways that could change, and we will see if they do,\" said Buffett.\n\nThe commentary is a potential sign that Berkshire is getting even more defensive than usual.\n\nBerkshire's underlying business is doing exceptionally well. Berkshire's Q1 operating income skyrocketed 39.1% compared to the same period of 2023 -- driven by larger gains from the insurance businesses and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (which had an abnormally weak Q1 last year). However, Buffett cautioned that it would be unwise to simply multiply insurance income by four for the full year, considering it was a particularly strong quarter and Q3 tends to be the quarter with the highest risk of claims.\n\nA great deal of the Q&A session was spent discussing the future of insurance and utilities based on new regulations; price increases due to climate change and higher risks of natural disasters; and the potential impact of autonomous driving reducing accidents and driving down the cost of insurance.\n\nAjit Jain, Berkshire's chairman of insurance operations, answered a question on cybersecurity insurance, saying the market is large and profitable and will probably get bigger but just isn't worth the risk until there are more data points. There was another question on rising insurance rates in Florida, which Berkshire attributed to climate change, increased risks of massive losses, and a difficult regulatory environment, making it harder to do business in Florida.\n\nAn advantage is that Berkshire prices a lot of its contracts in one-year intervals, so it can adjust prices if risks begin to ramp and outweigh rewards. Or as Jain put it, \"Climate change, much like inflation, done right, can be a friend of the risk bearer.\"\n\nAs for how autonomous driving affects insurance, Buffett said the problem is far from solved, that automakers have been considering insurance for a while, and that insurance can be \"a very tempting business when someone hands you money, and you hand them a little piece of paper.\" In other words, it isn't as easy as it seems. Accident rates have come down, and it would benefit society if autonomous driving allowed them to drop even further, but insurance will still be necessary.\n\nBuffett's response to a question on the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) was similar to his response from the 2023 annual meeting. He compared it to the atomic bomb and called it a genie in a bottle in that it has immense power, but we may regret we ever let it out.\n\nHe discussed a personal experience he had where he saw an AI-generated video of himself that was so lifelike that his kids nor his wife would be able to discern if it really was him or his voice except for the fact that he would never say the things in the video. \"if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the growth industry of all time,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Buffett stayed true to his longtime practice of keeping within his circle of competence, saying he doesn't know enough about AI to predict its future. \"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm, and I just don't know how that plays out.\"\n\nDespite the cautious sentiment, Buffett's optimism about the American economy and the stock market's ability to compound wealth over time was abundantly clear.\n\nOftentimes, folks pay too much attention to Berkshire's cash position as a barometer of its views on the stock market. While Berkshire keeping a large cash position is certainly defensive, it's worth understanding the context of its different business units and the history of a particular position like Apple.\n\nBerkshire probably never set out to have Apple make up 40% of its public equity holdings. Taking some risk off the table, especially given the lower tax rate, makes sense for Berkshire, especially if it believes it will need more reserve cash to handle changing dynamics in its insurance business.\n\nIn terms of life advice, the 93-year-old Buffett said that it's a good idea to think of what you want your obituary to read and start selecting the education paths, social paths, spouse, and friends to get you where you want to go. \"The opportunities in this country are basically limitless,\" said Buffett.\n\nWe can all learn a lot from Buffett's steadfast understanding of Berkshire shareholders' needs and the hard work that goes into selecting few investments and passing on countless opportunities.\n\nIn investing, it's important to align your risk tolerance, investment objectives, and holdings to achieve your financial goals and stay even-keeled no matter what the market is doing. In today's fast-paced world riddled with rapid change, staying true to your principles is more vital than ever.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"},

And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit (NZ$21.1b), or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64 per cent from $35.5b, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39 per cent to $11.222b, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days travelling from India to Omaha.\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting \"Woodstock for Capitalists\".\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a Desperate Housewives spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jamie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honouring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80 per cent of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nAbel offered a twist on Munger's classic \"I have nothing to add\" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying \"The only thing I would add.\"\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humour at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nA look to the future\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled.\n\nHe had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the non-insurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\"", "source": {"uri":

Since taking control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he's grown the value of the business, including its investments, by a compound annual growth rate of 19.8%. That compares with the 10.2% compound total return of the S&P 500 index during that time. Anyone who invested in Berkshire instead of an average S&P 500 fund would have 140 times the amount of wealth today.\n\nIn recent years, Buffett has been hard-pressed to find a great company to buy. As Berkshire Hathaway grows larger, its operations spin off more cash, and Buffett has seen the company's cash pile grow faster than he can find good investments. His largest investment last year totaled $9.2 billion, while the company ended the year with $167.6 billion.\n\nIt's a good bet Buffett will continue to snatch up shares of the company this year, as he sees it as undervalued in today's market.\n\nAs mentioned, Buffett hasn't seen a whole lot to like in the stock market over the past year, so his new investments have been few and far between.\n\nOne stock that he consistently added to in 2023 and continues to buy in 2024, though, is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). The company holds a strong position in the Permian Basin, giving it access to some of the lowest-cost oil supply in the country. Berkshire Hathaway first invested in Occidental with the purchase of $10 billion in preferred shares in 2019 to support the oil company's purchase of Anadarko. Buffett has since taken a massive 28% stake in the company through its common stock, more than offsetting Occidental's retirement of his preferred shares over the past year. Still, Buffett's Occidental purchases in 2023 only added up to about $3 billion.\n\nThere's another company Buffett bought a significant stake in last year as well. However, we still don't know exactly what it is. While Berkshire Hathaway is typically required to disclose every position in its portfolio at the end of each quarter, it received a special exemption from the SEC for the last two quarters of 2023. As a result, we don't know exactly what Buffett's been purchasing.\n\nBut we do have some clues. First of all, the company appears to be a financial stock, based on Berkshire Hathaway's reported cost basis of \"banks, insurance, and finance\" equities. Second, Berkshire's financial disclosures indicate it invested over $5 billion in the stock in 2023. That means the company must be very large, considering Berkshire is required to disclose the company after amassing a 5% stake in the business. My colleague Sean Williams narrowed the field to just seven potential candidates, his best guess being Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. Since Berkshire asked for the position to remain confidential, investors can bet he's planning to buy more in 2024.\n\nStill, both those investments pale in comparison to the amount Buffett spent on his largest purchase in 2023. Buffett spent $9.2 billion buying shares in one of his favorite stocks. His first purchase of the company's stock dates to 1962. Yes, Buffett's biggest stock purchase for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year was Berkshire Hathaway stock itself!\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's board of directors previously restricted Buffett's ability to buy back shares based on the stock's price-to-book-value ratio. If the ratio exceeded 1.2, Buffett couldn't buy back any shares of Berkshire Hathaway no matter how much he felt the market was undervaluing the stock.\n\nIn mid-2018, the board agreed to allow Buffett to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway as long as both he and late Vice Chairman Charlie Munger agreed the stock was priced below its intrinsic value based on a conservative estimate.\n\nSince Munger's passing, Buffett has become the sole determinant of the stock's intrinsic value. But investors shouldn't worry that he wields too much power. Buffett is adamant that management should never overpay to buy back its stock. He laid it out plainly in his most recent letter to shareholders: \"All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business value becomes stupid if done at a premium.\"\n\nWhat's more, Buffett holds about 99% of his wealth in Berkshire Hathaway stock, and he has many family members with significant amounts of their wealth in Berkshire stock. He only ever disposes of shares when he donates them to charity. His interests couldn't be more aligned with the rest of Berkshire's shareholders.\n\nNonetheless, Buffett has bought back shares of Berkshire Hathaway every quarter since the board authorized the change. That includes $9.2 billion worth last year.\n\nConsidering Berkshire Hathaway has been producing strong operating results from its wholly owned businesses, generating billions in free cash flow every quarter, it's very likely Buffett will continue to buy shares in 2024. Berkshire Hathaway stock currently trades for just 17.5 times forward earnings estimates. That's well below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 20.8. And when you consider the amount of cash on its balance sheet, that ratio looks even more appealing.\n\nSo Buffett would be more than justified in his continued repurchase of Berkshire Hathaway stock.

And he's seen how", "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nEARNINGS BEFORE MUSINGS\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA NOTABLE ABSENCE\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nNEXT GEN LEADERS\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nA LOOK TO THE FUTURE\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\" ___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

As per Berkshire, its net income fell 64 per cent, reflecting much lower unrealised gains from its common stock holdings as the share price of Apple declined. The global investment blue-chip also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock.\n\nThe Q1FY24 operating profit rose 39 per cent to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.

While he has scaled back public appearances in recent years, his presence at the meeting was significant, signaling the importance of the occasion.\n\nAlongside Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who has been designated as Buffett's successor, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, Buffett fielded questions from shareholders for about five hours.\n\nThe meeting took place at a crucial juncture for Berkshire as it grappled with challenges such as sustaining growth without overpaying for acquisitions and deciding whether to initiate a dividend payout. With $167.6 billion in cash on hand, the conglomerate faces the task of allocating capital effectively in a rapidly evolving market landscape.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue chip (stock market)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class A share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/bigmanwithawoman-171482611489816_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter profits plummeted along with the paper value of its investments, but the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright performed well.\n\nThe company reported reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That\u00b4s roughly one-third of last year's $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share.\n\nThe figures were heavily influenced by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire\u00b4s investments. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate\u00b4s operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year\u00b4s $8.065 billion as its insurance companies showed strong results.\n\nOn a per share basis, this year's first quarter operating figure amounts to $7,796.47 per Class A share, beating three analysts' estimates by FactSet Research, who predicted $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett was a net seller of $17 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire\u00b4s massive Apple stake. At $135.4 billion, the iPhone maker still accounts for the biggest share of Berkshire's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects it to remain so even up to when his successor Greg Abel takes over.\n\nThe estimated value of Berkshire\u00b4s Apple stake suggests Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. In the past, Buffett has said he invested in Apple\u00b4s stock because of how devoted consumers are to the company's products, similar to consumer brands he loves like Berkshire's own See's Candy.\n\nMichelle King of San Francisco does yoga in the See's Candies booth before the arrival of shareholders for the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting on Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Omaha, Neb. (AP Photo/Rebecca S. Gratz)\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago, as Geico in particular continued to improve its results. However, BNSF railroad\u00b4s profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion.\n\nMost of Berkshire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit, adding $717 million to Berkshire\u00b4s total.\n\nRevenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire\u00b4s cash pile climbed to a record $188.993 billion even after it spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year. Holdings including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n\"We\u00b4d love to spend it but we won\u00b4t spend it unless we\u00b4re doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nFrom left, D'Ann Rhoten takes a photo of Brittany Thornton and Melissa Shapiro in the exhibit hall of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting on Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Omaha, Neb.

And he's seen how", "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\"", "source": {"uri":

Operating earnings also rose, buoyed by his collection of insurance businesses.\n\nThe firm's hoard increased to $189 billion (\u20ac176 billion) at the end of the first quarter, topping the record it set at year-end. The company also reported first-quarter operating earnings of $11.2 billion, versus $8.07 billion for the same period a year earlier.\n\n\"I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively and therefore we don't use it now at 5.4 per cent but we wouldn't use it if it was at 1 per cent,\" Mr Buffett told the thousands of people attending Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in Omaha at the weekend. \"Don't tell the Federal Reserve that, we prefer it. We only swing at pitches we like.\"\n\nMr Buffett (93) has long decried a lack of meaningful deals that he said would give the firm a shot at \"eye-popping\" results. Even as the company ramped up acquisitions in recent years, including an $11.6 billion deal to buy Alleghany and its purchase of shares in Occidental Petroleum, Berkshire has struggled to find sizeable deals.\n\nThat has left Mr Buffett with more cash - what he called an unrivalled mountain of capital - than he and his investing deputies could quickly deploy.\n\nAs Berkshire's annual meeting - the first without Mr Buffett's long-time investing partner Charlie Munger, who died at 99 in late November - kicked off on Saturday, Mr Buffett said that \"it's a fair assumption\" that its cash pile will hit $200 billion at end of this quarter with few opportunities for needle-moving acquisitions on the horizon.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" he told the crowd of thousands. The company hopes for an \"occasional big opportunity,\" he added, later noting that it's looking at an investment in Canada.\n\nThe company sold some of its Apple shares in the quarter, reporting a $135.4 billion stake at the end of March, down from $174.3 billion at the end of the year. Apple has been hit by a drumbeat of negative news, including a $2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project.\n\nDespite the sale, Mr Buffett praised Apple, saying it's an \"even better\" business than two others it owns shares in - American Express and Coca-Cola. Apple will likely remain its top holding by the year-end, Mr Buffett said. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive officer, was in the audience.\n\nBerkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Mr Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment. The company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is currently the subject of takeover talks.\n\nIn the absence of deals, Berkshire has turned to buying back its own shares. It spent about $2.6 billion doing that in the first quarter, it said in its earnings statement Saturday.\n\nStill, Berkshire's giant cash pile has been a beneficiary of higher interest rates, which helped drive up interest and other investment income to $1.9 billion, from $1.1 billion in the first quarter of last year.\n\n\"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. \"Rising rates are enabling Berkshire's still considerable cash balance to once again earn a competitive return.\"\n\nBerkshire's earnings rose despite Mr Buffett's warning in May last year that profits at most of its operations would fall in 2023 as an \"incredible period\" for the US economy draws to an end. With businesses including railroad, retail, construction and energy, Berkshire is closely watched as a litmus test for US economic health, particularly amid elevated inflation and interest rates.\n\nEarnings at its collection of insurance businesses jumped to $2.6 billion, versus $911 million in the same period last year, thanks to improved results at its auto insurer Geico, fewer catastrophes and an increase in insurance investment income. The conglomerate's railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3% decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to \"unfavourable changes in business mix\" as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nBerkshire reported $12.7 billion in earnings attributable to shareholders for the first quarter, compared to $35.5 billion for the same period a year ago, largely due to lower investment income. Mr Buffett typically advises shareholders against relying on the firm's net income figures because they include the swings of its stock portfolio value and don't reflect performance of its vast group of businesses.\n\nMr Buffett acknowledged his mortality several times, telling shareholders: \"I not only hope you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\" - Bloomberg / Financial Times Limited

And he's seen how", "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nEARNINGS BEFORE MUSINGS\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA NOTABLE ABSENCE\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nNEXT GEN LEADERS\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nA LOOK TO THE FUTURE\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\" ___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

The death of Munger last year brought the question of succession to the forefront of many investors' minds at this year's shareholders meeting.\n\nAt times, Buffett, who's about to turn 94 in August, seemed to mull over his own mortality, even as he said he was feeling fine to continue running the business. He spoke from the dais at Omaha's CHI Health Center, where the meeting was held, with his lieutenants Greg Abel, Berkshire Hathaway Energy chairman and Buffett's heir apparent, as well as Ajit Jain, vice chairman of insurance operations.\n\n\"We'll see how the next management plays the game out at Berkshire, [but] fortunately you don't have too long to wait on that,\" Buffett said. \"I feel fine, but I know a little about actuarial tables.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be taking on any four-year employment contracts, like several people are doing in this world, at an age when you can't be quite that sure where you're going to be in four years,\" he added.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha provided more clarity than he'd had in the past on the leadership structure at Berkshire going forward, disclosing, for example, that Abel will have final say when it comes to the conglomerate's investing decisions.\n\n\"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg and he understands businesses extremely well,\" Buffett said Saturday. \"If you understand businesses, you'll understand common stocks.\"\n\nAbel, in turn, reassured investors that the culture at Berkshire will remain the same, as well as attract new people going forward. \"I think we have a very special company at Berkshire,\" he said, adding, \"that's not going to change.\"\n\nMunger's absence was felt deeply by many investors at this year's shareholder meeting. The business titan was known for his sharp wit and wisdom, and over the decades had drawn uproarious laughter from the crowd with his many humorous asides.\n\nSome of those zingers and insights were highlighted in a video tribute at the start of this year's meeting. At the 2015 meeting, for example, he observed, \"Warren, if people weren't so often wrong we wouldn't be so rich.\" As the lights of the arena came on at the conclusion of the short movie, some tens of thousands of investors got to their feet for a standing ovation.\n\nBuffett spoke often of Munger throughout the morning and afternoon sessions, referring to him as the \"architect\" of Berkshire's success. The two men shaped Berkshire into a $900 billion conglomerate from what had once been a textile mill. He also noted the characteristics he admired most in the late business titan, such as his honesty. \"When you get that in your life, you cherish those people and you sort of forget about the rest,\" he said.\n\nAt one point during the question-and-answer session, Buffett referred to Abel, who was sitting to his left, as the late Munger in a slip-up, prompting laughter from the crowd. \"I'm so used to that,\" admitted Buffett, who said he'd likely \"slip again\" during the meeting. Abel, who is Buffett's named successor, responded: \"It's a great honor.\"\n\nBuffett also took some time to honor Carol Loomis, the financial journalist who had edited his shareholder letter from 1977, all the way to the most recent Berkshire report. \"Carol is the best business writer,\" Buffett said, adding, \"Nobody came close to her, and she started from scratch.\"\n\nDespite the more solemn meeting, Buffett appeared intent to keep going for as long as he could at the helm. Addressing his shareholders at the conclusion of the 2024 shareholder meeting, the investor said: \"I not only hope you come next year. I hope I come next year.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHI_Health_Center_Omaha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CHI Health Center Omaha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_apparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heir apparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munger", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Actuarial science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Loomis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carol Loomis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Architect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/05/107410286-1714759879649-untitled-246-2-335_4466a8.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Berkshire did sell about 115 million Apple shares, about 13% of its stake. Based on the stock price, Berkshire's Apple stake ended the first quarter with 790 million shares.\n\nSo, why sell at all? Basically for tax reasons, Buffett said.\n\nApple's shares had risen 48% in 2023.\n\nApple's shares, however, fell nearly 11% during the quarter as well. They're up 7% since the end of March and 7.7% just since the end of April.\n\nBerkshire is up 11% this year but off 5% this quarter.\n\nRelated: Analysts weigh in on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has been a shareholder of Apple since 2016 when the late Charles Munger convinced Buffett it was a great stock to buy. Munger, Berkshire's long-time vice chairman, died in late 2023.\n\nThe investment has been fantastically successful for the company and Buffett still believes deeply in Apple.\n\nHe predicted the stock will still be Berkshire's biggest holding at the end of the year. And, he noted, Apple CEO Tim Cook was attending the meeting.\n\nBuffett also suggested the share sale may be tied to his view that tax rates may possibly be going higher to fund a ballooning U.S. fiscal deficit.\n\nPaying the taxes in selling Apple didn't bother Buffett \"in the least.\"\n\nAnd he added, \"I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it -- and if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\"\n\nApple remains still Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holding, representing about 40% of the value of the conglomerate's stock portfolio, which had a total value of about $335.9 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the portfolio was valued at $353.8 billion, with Apple representing about 49% of the portfolio's value.\n\nApple and stocks of four other companies represented about 75% of the value of the portfolio at the end of March The others are American Express (AXP) , Bank of America (BAC) , Coca Cola (KO) and Chevron (CVX) .

Then came the questions: How will it operate without Warren Buffett?\n\nWith the billionaire investor turning 94 this year and Munger's death in November, succession at Berkshire has become an increasingly pressing matter for shareholders, even after Buffett named his successor in Greg Abel in 2021. But for anyone speculating that Munger's passing might have hastened Buffett's retirement, he had this to say as he concluded the Saturday event: \"Not only do I hope you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\"\n\nBuffett and Munger transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a behemoth spanning industries including insurance, energy and railroads churning out billions in earnings -- including $11.2 billion in the first quarter -- and amassing a vast cash pile that hit a record $189 billion at the end of March. In an economy overshadowed by elevated inflation and uncertainty over rate cuts, shareholders who've gotten used to Berkshire's investing success were eager to know how this could continue without Buffett, who has been at the helm for decades.\n\nWhat would the culture at Berkshire be like under Abel, one asked, as the vice chairman for the company's non-insurance operations joined Buffett on stage to field questions. Would Abel take over the portfolio of stocks Buffett has been managing, came another question.\n\n\"That decision will be made when I'm not around,\" Buffett answered -- joking that he may try and haunt those who do it differently to him. \"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg. He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks.\"\n\nAbel's more than two-decade track record at the conglomerate includes high-profile dealmaking and overseeing its sprawling non-insurance businesses, from the BNSF railroad to Dairy Queen. But Buffett's aphorisms and stature as the Oracle of Omaha have earned him a reputation as the avuncular face of capitalism, and secured him a following that Abel may find hard to replicate.\n\nChris Bloomstran, who is president at Semper Augustus Investments Group, didn't seem concerned. Abel is a phenomenal leader who will be \"a great capital allocator,\" he said ahead of the meeting at the Gabelli Funds Annual Omaha Value Investor conference on Friday.\n\n\"There's no other Warren Buffett,\" he said. \"Fortunately they have a wonderful board.\"\n\nIt was inevitable that Munger's absence would loom large over the meeting, where he held court on stage alongside Buffett for decades, entertaining crowds with his witticisms and -- at times scathing -- quips. On the sidelines of Saturday's event, investors were clear there will never be another Buffett or Munger. However competent their successors, the pair brought an authenticity and charisma that would be hard to replace.\n\nMunger Tributes\n\nOn Saturday, Buffett extolled Munger's love of learning, his ability to navigate a path out of failures, his investing acumen and wisdom. He's never seen someone peaking at 99, Buffett said.\n\n\"He went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99, but the world was interested in him,\" Buffett said. At one point, Buffett mistakenly referred to Berkshire vice chairman Greg Abel as \"Charlie\" as he directed a question to him.\n\nAs succession repeatedly came up, Buffett kept invoking leadership changes at Apple, one of his favorite companies -- even though he sold some of its shares in the first quarter. He noted the strong leadership of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who took over for Steve Jobs.\n\nMunger died in November just months shy of his 100th birthday, prompting an outpouring of tributes praising his depth of knowledge, witticisms and investing acumen. A lawyer by training, Munger helped Buffett, who was seven years his junior, craft a philosophy of investing in companies for the long term.\n\n\"I think he gave us all permission to tell the honest truth when we can,\" John Rogers, who is co-chief executive officer at Ariel Investments, said at the Gabelli event. \"And that's the thing I think I take away from Charlie the most.\"\n\nUnder their management, Berkshire averaged an annual gain of 20% from 1965 through 2022 -- roughly twice the pace of the S&P 500 Index. Decades of compounded returns made the pair billionaires and folk heroes to adoring investors.\n\n\"I think Charlie would be the first to say that if Berkshire was harmed by his departure, they weren't doing their jobs,\" Adam Mead, who wrote \"The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway,\" said.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munger", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_Queen", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augustus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNSF_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BNSF Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Investments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariel Investments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folk hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2023/12/MixCollage-07-Dec-2023-04-56-PM-6081.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that Buffett himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology and may do more harm with it than good.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nEarnings\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallow plush toys of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from around the world and is unlike any other company meeting.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA notable absence\n\nDevotees come for tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting Woodstock for Capitalists.\n\nThis was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best-known quotes, including classics like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners.\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nNext Gen leaders\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Greg Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nA look to the future\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\"", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"},

But this year's meeting felt different.\n\nLongtime vice chairman Charlie Munger passed away in late November. His wry sense of humor, witty aphorisms, and entertaining rapport with Buffett were missed dearly. But there were other noticeable differences between this meeting and those of past years -- namely, a sense of caution.\n\nLet's dive into the key takeaways from the meeting and how it could influence what Berkshire does next.\n\nThe elephant in the room was Berkshire's decision to trim its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the first quarter. Berkshire sold over 116 million shares of Apple in Q1, reducing its position by around 12.9%. It marks the company's largest sale of Apple stock since it began purchasing shares in 2016 -- far larger than the 10 million or so shares Berkshire sold in Q4.\n\nBuffett addressed the sale with the first answer in the Q&A session: \"Unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation and strategy, we will have Apple as our largest investment. But I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternatives of what's available in equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\"\n\nIn addition to valuation concerns, market conditions, and wanting to build up the cash position, Buffett also mentioned the federal rate on capital gains, which Buffett said is 21% compared to 35% not long ago and even as high as 52% in the past. Fears that the tax rate could go up based on fiscal policies and a need to cut the federal deficit is another reason why Buffett and his team decided to book gains on Apple stock now instead of risking a potentially higher tax rate in the future.\n\nHoarding a treasure trove of cash\n\nBuffett has long spoken about the faith Berkshire shareholders entrust in him and his team to safeguard and grow their wealth. Berkshire is known for being fairly risk-averse, gravitating toward businesses with stable cash flows like insurance, railroads, utilities, and top brands like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), American Express (NYSE: AXP), and Apple. Another asset Berkshire loves is cash.\n\nBerkshire's cash and U.S. treasury position reached $182.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $163.3 billion at the end of 2023. Buffett said he expects the cash position to exceed $200 billion by the end of the second quarter.\n\nYou may think Berkshire is stockpiling cash because of higher interest rates and a better return on risk-free assets. But shortly before the lunch break, Buffett said that Berkshire would still be heavily in cash even if interest rates were 1% because Berkshire only swings at pitches it likes, and it won't swing at a pitch simply because it hasn't in a while. \"It's just that things aren't attractive, and there are certain ways that could change, and we will see if they do,\" said Buffett.\n\nThe commentary is a potential sign that Berkshire is getting even more defensive than usual.\n\nA complex but profitable insurance landscape\n\nBerkshire's underlying business is doing exceptionally well. Berkshire's Q1 operating income skyrocketed 39.1% compared to the same period of 2023 -- driven by larger gains from the insurance businesses and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (which had an abnormally weak Q1 last year). However, Buffett cautioned that it would be unwise to simply multiply insurance income by four for the full year, considering it was a particularly strong quarter and Q3 tends to be the quarter with the highest risk of claims.\n\nA great deal of the Q&A session was spent discussing the future of insurance and utilities based on new regulations; price increases due to climate change and higher risks of natural disasters; and the potential impact of autonomous driving reducing accidents and driving down the cost of insurance.\n\nAjit Jain, Berkshire's chairman of insurance operations, answered a question on cybersecurity insurance, saying the market is large and profitable and will probably get bigger but just isn't worth the risk until there are more data points. There was another question on rising insurance rates in Florida, which Berkshire attributed to climate change, increased risks of massive losses, and a difficult regulatory environment, making it harder to do business in Florida.\n\nAn advantage is that Berkshire prices a lot of its contracts in one-year intervals, so it can adjust prices if risks begin to ramp and outweigh rewards. Or as Jain put it, \"Climate change, much like inflation, done right, can be a friend of the risk bearer.\"\n\nAs for how autonomous driving affects insurance, Buffett said the problem is far from solved, that automakers have been considering insurance for a while, and that insurance can be \"a very tempting business when someone hands you money, and you hand them a little piece of paper.\" In other words, it isn't as easy as it seems. Accident rates have come down, and it would benefit society if autonomous driving allowed them to drop even further, but insurance will still be necessary.\n\nOpening the Pandora's Box of AI\n\nBuffett's response to a question on the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) was similar to his response from the 2023 annual meeting. He compared it to the atomic bomb and called it a genie in a bottle in that it has immense power, but we may regret we ever let it out.\n\nHe discussed a personal experience he had where he saw an AI-generated video of himself that was so lifelike that his kids nor his wife would be able to discern if it really was him or his voice except for the fact that he would never say the things in the video. \"if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the growth industry of all time,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Buffett stayed true to his longtime practice of keeping within his circle of competence, saying he doesn't know enough about AI to predict its future. \"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm, and I just don't know how that plays out.\"\n\nLimitless opportunities\n\nDespite the cautious sentiment, Buffett's optimism about the American economy and the stock market's ability to compound wealth over time was abundantly clear.\n\nOftentimes, folks pay too much attention to Berkshire's cash position as a barometer of its views on the stock market. While Berkshire keeping a large cash position is certainly defensive, it's worth understanding the context of its different business units and the history of a particular position like Apple.\n\nBerkshire probably never set out to have Apple make up 40% of its public equity holdings. Taking some risk off the table, especially given the lower tax rate, makes sense for Berkshire, especially if it believes it will need more reserve cash to handle changing dynamics in its insurance business.\n\nIn terms of life advice, the 93-year-old Buffett said that it's a good idea to think of what you want your obituary to read and start selecting the education paths, social paths, spouse, and friends to get you where you want to go. \"The opportunities in this country are basically limitless,\" said Buffett.\n\nWe can all learn a lot from Buffett's steadfast understanding of Berkshire shareholders' needs and the hard work that goes into selecting few investments and passing on countless opportunities.\n\nIn investing, it's important to align your risk tolerance, investment objectives, and holdings to achieve your financial goals and stay even-keeled no matter what the market is doing. In today's fast-paced world riddled with rapid change, staying true to your principles is more vital than ever.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

Then came the questions: How will it operate without Warren Buffett?\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWith the billionaire investor turning 94 this year and Munger's death in November, succession at Berkshire has become an increasingly pressing matter for shareholders, even after Buffett named his successor in Greg Abel in 2021. But for anyone speculating that Munger's passing might have hastened Buffett's retirement, he had this to say as he concluded the Saturday event: \"Not only do I hope you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\"\n\nBuffett and Munger transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a behemoth spanning industries including insurance, energy and railroads churning out billions in earnings -- including $11.2 billion in the first quarter -- and amassing a vast cash pile that hit a record $189 billion at the end of March. In an economy overshadowed by elevated inflation and uncertainty over rate cuts, shareholders who've gotten used to Berkshire's investing success were eager to know how this could continue without Buffett, who has been at the helm for decades.\n\nWhat would the culture at Berkshire be like under Abel, one asked, as the vice chairman for the company's non-insurance operations joined Buffett on stage to field questions. Would Abel take over the portfolio of stocks Buffett has been managing, came another question.\n\n\"That decision will be made when I'm not around,\" Buffett answered -- joking that he may try and haunt those who do it differently to him. \"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg. He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks.\"\n\nAbel's more than two-decade track record at the conglomerate includes high-profile dealmaking and overseeing its sprawling non-insurance businesses, from the BNSF railroad to Dairy Queen. But Buffett's aphorisms and stature as the Oracle of Omaha have earned him a reputation as the avuncular face of capitalism, and secured him a following that Abel may find hard to replicate.\n\nChris Bloomstran, who is president at Semper Augustus Investments Group, didn't seem concerned. Abel is a phenomenal leader who will be \"a great capital allocator,\" he said ahead of the meeting at the Gabelli Funds Annual Omaha Value Investor conference on Friday.\n\n\"There's no other Warren Buffett,\" he said. \"Fortunately they have a wonderful board.\"\n\nIt was inevitable that Munger's absence would loom large over the meeting, where he held court on stage alongside Buffett for decades, entertaining crowds with his witticisms and -- at times scathing -- quips. On the sidelines of Saturday's event, investors were clear there will never be another Buffett or Munger. However competent their successors, the pair brought an authenticity and charisma that would be hard to replace.\n\nMunger Tributes\n\nOn Saturday, Buffett extolled Munger's love of learning, his ability to navigate a path out of failures, his investing acumen and wisdom. He's never seen someone peaking at 99, Buffett said.\n\n\"He went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99, but the world was interested in him,\" Buffett said. At one point, Buffett mistakenly referred to Berkshire vice chairman Greg Abel as \"Charlie\" as he directed a question to him.\n\nAs succession repeatedly came up, Buffett kept invoking leadership changes at Apple, one of his favorite companies -- even though he sold some of its shares in the first quarter. He noted the strong leadership of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who took over for Steve Jobs.\n\nRead More: Charles Munger, Who Built Berkshire With Buffett, Dies at 99\n\nMunger died in November just months shy of his 100th birthday, prompting an outpouring of tributes praising his depth of knowledge, witticisms and investing acumen. A lawyer by training, Munger helped Buffett, who was seven years his junior, craft a philosophy of investing in companies for the long term.\n\n\"I think he gave us all permission to tell the honest truth when we can,\" John Rogers, who is co-chief executive officer at Ariel Investments, said at the Gabelli event. \"And that's the thing I think I take away from Charlie the most.\"\n\nRead More: A Master of One-Liners: Munger on Politics, Life and Crypto\n\nUnder their management, Berkshire averaged an annual gain of 20% from 1965 through 2022 -- roughly twice the pace of the S&P 500 Index. Decades of compounded returns made the pair billionaires and folk heroes to adoring investors.\n\n\"I think Charlie would be the first to say that if Berkshire was harmed by his departure, they weren't doing their jobs,\" Adam Mead, who wrote \"The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway,\" said.\n\n--With assistance from Katherine Doherty and Paige Smith.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\nHundreds of shareholders waited in line overnight to get in early. When the doors opened, some shareholders ran in to get good seats and the auditorium quickly filled up.\n\n\"I was here since 2:30 a.m.,\" said Serena Lam, 32, an investment portfolio manager who flew in with 40 others from Hong Kong and was standing first in line at one of the entrances. \"I want to see Warren Buffett. I want to get his perspective about Japanese stocks. I flew over 25 hours for this.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\nBill Gunther, 72, a retired state forester from Newfane, Vermont, brought a lawn chair to sit in while on line.\n\n\"I feel very bullish about Berkshire. They're so diversified and have a good company culture. That's the one thing that I loved.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy cash on hand that stood at $189 billion as of the end of March.\n\nThe shareholder meeting is the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Warren to not have Charlie there,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, attending his 32nd Berkshire meeting.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND\n\nBerkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nBerkshire's stock is up 23% over the last year, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, it has risen 218% versus the S&P's 172% gain.\n\n, bolstered by a significant increase in income from insurance underwriting. Net income fell, reflecting much lower unrealized gains from its common stock holdings. The size of Berkshire's stake in Apple stake fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company.\n\n\"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\"\n\nBerkshire will also release first-quarter results and shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six.\n\nThe weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nRuth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession.\n\n\"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\" (Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Cynthia Osterman and Jason Neely)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Then came the questions: How will it operate without Warren Buffett?\n\nWith the billionaire investor turning 94 this year and Munger's death in November, succession at Berkshire has become an increasingly pressing matter for shareholders, even after Buffett named his successor in Greg Abel in 2021. But for anyone speculating that Munger's passing might have hastened Buffett's retirement, he had this to say as he concluded the Saturday event: \"Not only do I hope you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\"\n\nBuffett and Munger transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a behemoth spanning industries including insurance, energy and railroads churning out billions in earnings -- including $11.2 billion in the first quarter -- and amassing a vast cash pile that hit a record $189 billion at the end of March. In an economy overshadowed by elevated inflation and uncertainty over rate cuts, shareholders who've gotten used to Berkshire's investing success were eager to know how this could continue without Buffett, who has been at the helm for decades.\n\nWhat would the culture at Berkshire be like under Abel, one asked, as the vice chairman for the company's non-insurance operations joined Buffett on stage to field questions. Would Abel take over the portfolio of stocks Buffett has been managing, came another question.\n\n\"That decision will be made when I'm not around,\" Buffett answered -- joking that he may try and haunt those who do it differently to him. \"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg. He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks.\"\n\nAbel's more than two-decade track record at the conglomerate includes high-profile dealmaking and overseeing its sprawling non-insurance businesses, from the BNSF railroad to Dairy Queen. But Buffett's aphorisms and stature as the Oracle of Omaha have earned him a reputation as the avuncular face of capitalism, and secured him a following that Abel may find hard to replicate.\n\nChris Bloomstran, who is president at Semper Augustus Investments Group, didn't seem concerned. Abel is a phenomenal leader who will be \"a great capital allocator,\" he said ahead of the meeting at the Gabelli Funds Annual Omaha Value Investor conference on Friday.\n\n\"There's no other Warren Buffett,\" he said. \"Fortunately they have a wonderful board.\"\n\nIt was inevitable that Munger's absence would loom large over the meeting, where he held court on stage alongside Buffett for decades, entertaining crowds with his witticisms and -- at times scathing -- quips. On the sidelines of Saturday's event, investors were clear there will never be another Buffett or Munger. However competent their successors, the pair brought an authenticity and charisma that would be hard to replace.\n\nMunger Tributes\n\nOn Saturday, Buffett extolled Munger's love of learning, his ability to navigate a path out of failures, his investing acumen and wisdom. He's never seen someone peaking at 99, Buffett said.\n\n\"He went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99, but the world was interested in him,\" Buffett said. At one point, Buffett mistakenly referred to Berkshire vice chairman Greg Abel as \"Charlie\" as he directed a question to him.\n\nAs succession repeatedly came up, Buffett kept invoking leadership changes at Apple, one of his favorite companies -- even though he sold some of its shares in the first quarter. He noted the strong leadership of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who took over for Steve Jobs.\n\nRead More: Charles Munger, Who Built Berkshire With Buffett, Dies at 99\n\nMunger died in November just months shy of his 100th birthday, prompting an outpouring of tributes praising his depth of knowledge, witticisms and investing acumen. A lawyer by training, Munger helped Buffett, who was seven years his junior, craft a philosophy of investing in companies for the long term.\n\n\"I think he gave us all permission to tell the honest truth when we can,\" John Rogers, who is co-chief executive officer at Ariel Investments, said at the Gabelli event. \"And that's the thing I think I take away from Charlie the most.\"\n\nRead More: A Master of One-Liners: Munger on Politics, Life and Crypto\n\nUnder their management, Berkshire averaged an annual gain of 20% from 1965 through 2022 -- roughly twice the pace of the S&P 500 Index. Decades of compounded returns made the pair billionaires and folk heroes to adoring investors.\n\n\"I think Charlie would be the first to say that if Berkshire was harmed by his departure, they weren't doing their jobs,\" Adam Mead, who wrote \"The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway,\" said.\n\n--With assistance from Katherine Doherty and Paige Smith.", "source": {"uri":

In addition to the headline revenue and earnings numbers, investors always watch Berkshire's cash stockpile, buyback activity, and the operating income from its subsidiary businesses.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a rundown of the key numbers, a major investment move that was revealed, and the important information we don't know yet.\n\nThe headline numbers (which don't mean much)\n\nWarren Buffett himself has cautioned investors not to pay too much attention to the company's net income (earnings per share, or EPS), as it includes unrealized investment gains and losses from Berkshire's massive stock portfolio. That's especially true for the first quarter, as an excellent first quarter of 2023 resulted in an EPS decline of 64% -- even though Berkshire's business performed quite well, as we'll see in the next section.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew by 5%, and it's worth noting that both the top and bottom-line numbers came in significantly higher than analysts had been expecting.\n\nOperating earnings paint a better picture\n\nBerkshire's operating earnings tell us how the company's subsidiary businesses are performing, and these look great. Overall, Berkshire's operating earnings grew by 39% year over year.\n\nMuch of this strong performance was due to the insurance business. Underwriting income nearly tripled year over year, and investment income grew by 32%, mainly due to the rising interest rate environment over the past year. Berkshire Hathaway Energy operating earnings rose by 72% year over year. The only significant decline was an 8% year-over-year drop in BNSF Railroad's operating earnings, but the rest of Berkshire's business more than made up for it.\n\nIs Buffett souring on Apple?\n\nOne of the most important things investors should know about Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly reports is what isn't revealed.\n\nSpecifically, while Berkshire reports the cost basis of its massive stock portfolio from quarter to quarter, we generally don't know what stocks Berkshire bought or sold (with few exceptions) until its 13-F is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This quarter's filing is due on May 15, so we'll get an updated snapshot of Berkshire's portfolio as it stood on March 31.\n\nHowever, Berkshire reports the market value of its largest stock positions as of the end of the quarter. Judging by these, it appears that Berkshire unloaded about 13% of its massive Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investment during the first quarter. This would certainly explain the rapid growth in the cash stockpile, as well as the realized investment gains of $11.2 billion Berkshire mentioned in its earnings release.\n\nBuybacks accelerated in the first quarter\n\nBerkshire's buyback activity is always of interest to shareholders, as it provides insight into whether Buffett thinks the company's stock is attractive. While a price below intrinsic value is a requirement for buybacks to take place at all, the pace of buybacks has varied widely over the past few years.\n\nThe first-quarter earnings report shows that Berkshire spent $2.6 billion on buybacks, including both Class A and Class B shares.\n\nFor context, Berkshire repurchased $2.2 billion of its shares in the fourth quarter of 2023 and spent $9.2 billion throughout the entirety of last year. So, the first quarter represents a bit of an acceleration.\n\nBerkshire's cash hoard hits a new record\n\nAt the end of 2023, Berkshire's cash stockpile soared to an all-time high of $167.6 billion. Simply put, Buffett has found it difficult to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in recent years, and with short-term Treasuries yielding about 5% on Berkshire's idle cash, Buffett is in no rush to pull the trigger.\n\nTo say that Berkshire's cash hoard grew in the first quarter would be an understatement. Including cash, equivalents, and short-term Treasury Bills, Berkshire now has a staggering $189 billion on its balance sheet.\n\nFinally, the earnings report was released on the morning of Berkshire's widely followed annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The meeting includes hours of Q&A with Warren Buffett and the heads of Berkshire's insurance and non-insurance operations, so there's likely to be some new information (and investment wisdom) shared throughout the day. We may even find out why Buffett sold a significant amount of Apple.

(AP) -- Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8,825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\nAbel offered a twist on Munger's classic \"I have nothing to add\" line by often starting his answers Saturday by saying \"The only thing I would add.\"\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [],

Abel has been overseeing a major portion of Berkshire's sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail.\n\nBuffett offered the clearest insight into his succession plan to date after years of speculation about the exact roles of Berkshire's top executives after the eventual transition. The investing icon, who's turning 94 years old in August, said his decision is influenced by how large Berkshire's assets have grown.\n\n\"I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think that responsibility should be that of the CEO and whatever that CEO decides may be helpful,\" Buffett said. \"The sums have grown so large at Berkshire and we do not want to try and have two people around that are managing a billion each. It just doesn't work.\"\n\nBerkshire's cash pile ballooned to nearly $189 billion at the end of March, while its gigantic equity portfolio has stocks worth a whopping $860 billion based on today's market prices.\n\n\"I think what you're handling the sums that we will have, you've got to think very strategically about how to do very big things,\" Buffett added.\n\nWhile Buffett has made clear that Abel would be taking over the CEO job, there were still questions about who would control the Berkshire public stock portfolio, where Buffett has garnered a huge following by racking up huge returns through investments in the likes of Coca-Cola and Apple.\n\nBerkshire investing managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, both former hedge fund managers, have helped Buffett manage a small portion of the stock portfolio (about 10%) for about the last decade. There was speculation that they may take over that portion of the Berkshire CEO role when he is no longer able.\n\nBut it seems by Buffett's latest comments that Abel will have final decision on all capital allocation, including stock picks.\n\n\"I think the chief executive should be somebody that can weigh buying businesses, buying stocks, doing all kinds of things that might come up at a time when nobody else is willing to move,\" Buffett said.\n\nAbel is known for his strong expertise in the energy industry. Berkshire acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999 and Abel became CEO of the company in 2008, six years before it was renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 2014.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Weschler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Weschler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MidAmerican_Energy_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MidAmerican Energy Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/05/107410248-1714758200751-untitled-56-2-182.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It was the second consecutive quarter that the conglomerate has reduced its holdings of the iPhone maker.\n\nApple's share price fell 11% in the quarter, as the tech giant endured a rough start to 2024.\n\nGiven those figures, Berkshire sold roughly 13% of its holdings in the company last quarter, leaving it with about 790 million Apple shares.\n\nBut Buffett said during the morning question-and-answer session at Berkshire's annual shareholder conference on Saturday that it's \"extremely likely\" that Apple remains Berkshire's largest common stock holding -- and that it will stay that way unless something dramatic happens.\n\n\"Unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple, and American Express, and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" the 93-year-old Buffett said, referring to Greg Abel, his handpicked successor.\n\nBerkshire reported that its American Express stake was worth $34.5 billion last quarter, and its Coca-Cola holdings were worth $24.5 billion.

During Saturday's presentation, the chairman accidentally referred to Abel, his new right-hand man, as Munger.\n\nAbel took it in stride, calling it a \"great honor\" to be mistaken for Munger.\n\nBuffett also discussed his decision to slash the company's stake in Apple, aired his concerns about AI and deepfakes, and articulated his hope to keep going long enough for next year's shareholders meeting.\n\n\"I not only hope you come next year, but I hope I come next year,\" Buffett said in his sign-off.\n\nRepresentatives for Buffett did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_getahun@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Hannah Getahun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Employment contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Actuarial science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6636bd5d0dfb1341e902aadb.jpg?ver=1714878021", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The sale of Apple shares represented a significant change in Buffett's previous strategy, Reuters reminds us.\n\nThe CNBC report noted that Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple by 13%.\n\nThe first quarter results were also discussed at the meeting. The company achieved significant operating profit, supported by an improvement in the insurance industry and higher returns on investments. Despite Apple's decline in shares, Buffett assured attendees that the iPhone maker remains his largest investment.\n\nAlso present at the meeting were Buffett's successors: Vice President Greg Abel and Vice President Ajit Jain. Abel was named Buffett's successor in 2021.\n\nAmong the participants were those who had flown thousands of miles to attend this event. Investors and fans were eagerly awaiting Buffett's opinion on, among other things, Japanese stocks and the question of succession.\n\nBuffett emphasized that although Apple's stake was reduced, he did not regret the decision and continued to view the company's shares as important to his portfolio.

(AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter profits plummeted along with the paper value of its investments, but the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright performed well.\n\nThe company reported reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of last year's $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share.\n\nThe figures were heavily influenced by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies showed strong results.\n\nOn a per share basis, this year's first quarter operating figure amounts to $7,796.47 per Class A share, beating three analysts' estimates by FactSet Research, who predicted $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett was a net seller of $17 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. At $135.4 billion, the iPhone maker still accounts for the biggest share of Berkshire's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects it to remain so even up to when his successor Greg Abel takes over.\n\nThe estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. In the past, Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the company's products, similar to consumer brands he loves like Berkshire's own See's Candy.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago, as Geico in particular continued to improve its results. However, BNSF railroad's profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion.\n\nMost of Berkshire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit, adding $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nRevenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's cash pile climbed to a record $188.993 billion even after it spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year. Holdings including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_funk@aol.com", "name": "Josh Funk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Class A share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-share_(mainland_China)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-share (mainland China)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GEICO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See's_Candies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "See's Candies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNSF_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BNSF Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VKyJ_aGNLvqfm6_y07Stwg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_associated_press_484/6e04019af7e86a8621e935987e9282f5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

But they're not worried about their investments. \"The crowds will be smaller when Buffett isn't here, but the company will still do well,\" said Jason Garner, a 20-year-old student from Queens University in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nBerkshire is an $865 billion conglomerate whose dozens of companies include Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, many utilities, industrial businesses, and the maker of Ginsu knives. Buffett has run it from his hometown of Omaha since 1965. Despite Berkshire's size, its shares outgained the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last decade, though by less than they once did.\n\nMany who attended the weekend Buffett dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" expressed confidence, sometimes tinged with unease, about Berkshire's future without the legendary billionaire. The death in November of Buffett's longtime business partner Charlie Munger at age 99 renewed focus on Buffett's own age.\n\nBuffett navigated almost five hours of shareholder questions in a downtown arena with his successor-in-waiting Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61. In an adjacent exhibit hall featuring Berkshire companies, shareholders scooped up spatulas, jewelry, Squishmallows toys and several tons of See's Candies. Many posed for photos with the Geico gecko.\n\nA large number of shareholders came from across the globe. \"Warren said Berkshire is built to last,\" said Mike Lin, a financial analyst from Guangzhou, China, who with his sister bought Benjamin Moore teddy bears.\n\nLygia Bulle, a financial planner from Curitiba, Brazil, took her 17- and 19-year-old sons to the meeting. \"Warren Buffett is the greatest investor in the world,\" she said. \"Going to see him in person has a different impact from seeing him at home.\"\n\nBRAVING THE RAIN As usual, thousands of shareholders lined up in the overnight hours Saturday to hear Buffett, despite rain and wind that shortened the lines. Some said people were waiting 12 hours before the arena's 7 a.m. opening.\n\nBuffett's fame, wisdom and magnetism are a big part of the draw. Abel won't command the same affection from shareholders though leaders of Berkshire's businesses say they regard him highly. No one knows if the weekend will stay the same without Buffett. Omaha hopes so: no annual event other than baseball's College World Series matters more to its economy.\n\n\"Yes, I will be back if Warren Buffett isn't here because I will wonder about Berkshire Hathaway's future,\" said Gyuhwan Kim, 26, a software engineer from South Korea who got in line at 3:30 a.m. \"But no, I will not come this early. Once is enough.\" Jordan Kaneshiro, a Honolulu native now working as a nurse in Omaha, said: \"It's just one of the things you have got to do. You buy shares of a company and you want to see what the company is up to.\"\n\nThat approach would survive Buffett's exit. Buffett acknowledged that time will come, perhaps soon, breaking out in laughter after telling shareholders: \"I not only hope that you come next year, I hope I come next year.\"\n\nRichard Callahan, a BMO banker from Omaha, said Buffett has become less visible locally. \"You just don't see him,\" he said. \"I live and work in the same neighborhood. You don't see him out in his car as much, and once in a while you'll see him with a driver.\"\n\nBut the 57-year-old still marvels at Buffett. \"93?\" he said. \"I can only hope that I'm functioning as he is.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

In addition to the headline revenue and earnings numbers, investors always watch Berkshire's cash stockpile, buyback activity, and the operating income from its subsidiary businesses.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a rundown of the key numbers, a major investment move that was revealed, and the important information we don't know yet.\n\nWarren Buffett himself has cautioned investors not to pay too much attention to the company's net income (earnings per share, or EPS), as it includes unrealized investment gains and losses from Berkshire's massive stock portfolio. That's especially true for the first quarter, as an excellent first quarter of 2023 resulted in an EPS decline of 64% -- even though Berkshire's business performed quite well, as we'll see in the next section.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew by 5%, and it's worth noting that both the top and bottom-line numbers came in significantly higher than analysts had been expecting.\n\nBerkshire's operating earnings tell us how the company's subsidiary businesses are performing, and these look great. Overall, Berkshire's operating earnings grew by 39% year over year.\n\nMuch of this strong performance was due to the insurance business. Underwriting income nearly tripled year over year, and investment income grew by 32%, mainly due to the rising interest rate environment over the past year. Berkshire Hathaway Energy operating earnings rose by 72% year over year. The only significant decline was an 8% year-over-year drop in BNSF Railroad's operating earnings, but the rest of Berkshire's business more than made up for it.\n\nOne of the most important things investors should know about Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly reports is what isn't revealed.\n\nSpecifically, while Berkshire reports the cost basis of its massive stock portfolio from quarter to quarter, we generally don't know what stocks Berkshire bought or sold (with few exceptions) until its 13-F is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This quarter's filing is due on May 15, so we'll get an updated snapshot of Berkshire's portfolio as it stood on March 31.\n\nHowever, Berkshire reports the market value of its largest stock positions as of the end of the quarter. Judging by these, it appears that Berkshire unloaded about 13% of its massive Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investment during the first quarter. This would certainly explain the rapid growth in the cash stockpile, as well as the realized investment gains of $11.2 billion Berkshire mentioned in its earnings release.\n\nBerkshire's buyback activity is always of interest to shareholders, as it provides insight into whether Buffett thinks the company's stock is attractive. While a price below intrinsic value is a requirement for buybacks to take place at all, the pace of buybacks has varied widely over the past few years.\n\nThe first-quarter earnings report shows that Berkshire spent $2.6 billion on buybacks, including both Class A and Class B shares.\n\nFor context, Berkshire repurchased $2.2 billion of its shares in the fourth quarter of 2023 and spent $9.2 billion throughout the entirety of last year. So, the first quarter represents a bit of an acceleration.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Berkshire's cash stockpile soared to an all-time high of $167.6 billion. Simply put, Buffett has found it difficult to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in recent years, and with short-term Treasuries yielding about 5% on Berkshire's idle cash, Buffett is in no rush to pull the trigger.\n\nTo say that Berkshire's cash hoard grew in the first quarter would be an understatement. Including cash, equivalents, and short-term Treasury Bills, Berkshire now has a staggering $189 billion on its balance sheet.\n\nFinally, the earnings report was released on the morning of Berkshire's widely followed annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The meeting includes hours of Q&A with Warren Buffett and the heads of Berkshire's insurance and non-insurance operations, so there's likely to be some new information (and investment wisdom) shared throughout the day. We may even find out why Buffett sold a significant amount of Apple.

Buffett said time and again he is no AI expert, at one point characterizing himself as someone who \"doesn't understand a damn thing about it.\"\n\nStill, Buffett analogized the advent of the AI boom to the discovery of the nuclear bomb on more than one occasion, saying these two technologies are proverbial genies that cannot be put back in the bottle.\n\nAs for the company's growing pile of cash and Treasury holdings, Buffett said it is likely the value of these holdings exceeds $200 billion during the current quarter, noting he's \"quite satisfied\" with the position.\n\nAsked about Berkshire's appetite for increasing investments overseas, and in China specifically, Buffett said, \"Our primary investments will always be in the United States.\"\n\nTowards the end of the proceedings, Buffett spoke about Federal Reserve policy for the first time, suggesting to shareholders the US government's accumulated deficit garners more of his attention than Fed policy.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

(AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter profits plummeted along with the paper value of its investments, but the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright performed well.\n\nThe company reported reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of last year's $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share.\n\nThe figures were heavily influenced by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies showed strong results.\n\nOn a per share basis, this year's first quarter operating figure amounts to $7,796.47 per Class A share, beating three analysts' estimates by FactSet Research, who predicted $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett was a net seller of $17 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire's massive Apple stake. At $135.4 billion, the iPhone maker still accounts for the biggest share of Berkshire's $364 billion portfolio.

In the past, Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the company's products, similar to consumer brands he loves like Berkshire's own See's Candy.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago, as Geico in particular continued to improve its results. However, BNSF railroad's profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion.\n\nMost of Berkshire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit, adding $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nRevenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's cash pile climbed to a record $188.993 billion even after it spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year. Holdings including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But they're not worried about their investments.\n\n\"The crowds will be smaller when Buffett isn't here, but the company will still do well,\" said Jason Garner, a 20-year-old student from Queens University in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nBerkshire is an US$865 billion conglomerate whose dozens of companies include Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, many utilities, industrial businesses, and the maker of Ginsu knives.\n\nBuffett has run it from his hometown of Omaha since 1965. Despite Berkshire's size, its shares outgained the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last decade, though by less than they once did.\n\nMany who attended the weekend Buffett dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" expressed confidence, sometimes tinged with unease, about Berkshire's future without the legendary billionaire.\n\nThe death in November of Buffett's longtime business partner Charlie Munger at age 99 renewed focus on Buffett's own age.\n\nBuffett navigated almost five hours of shareholder questions in a downtown arena with his successor-in-waiting Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61.\n\nIn an adjacent exhibit hall featuring Berkshire companies, shareholders scooped up spatulas, jewellery, Squishmallows toys and several tons of See's Candies. Many posed for photos with the Geico gecko.\n\nA large number of shareholders came from across the globe.\n\n\"Warren said Berkshire is built to last,\" said Mike Lin, a financial analyst from Guangzhou, China, who with his sister bought Benjamin Moore teddy bears.\n\nLygia Bulle, a financial planner from Curitiba, Brazil, took her 17- and 19-year-old sons to the meeting.\n\n\"Warren Buffett is the greatest investor in the world,\" she said. \"Going to see him in person has a different impact from seeing him at home.\"\n\nBraving the rain\n\nAs usual, thousands of shareholders lined up in the overnight hours Saturday to hear Buffett, despite rain and wind that shortened the lines. Some said people were waiting 12 hours before the arena's 7am opening.\n\nBuffett's fame, wisdom and magnetism are a big part of the draw. Abel won't command the same affection from shareholders though leaders of Berkshire's businesses say they regard him highly.\n\nNo one knows if the weekend will stay the same without Buffett. Omaha hopes so: no annual event other than baseball's College World Series matters more to its economy.\n\n\"Yes, I will be back if Warren Buffett isn't here because I will wonder about Berkshire Hathaway's future,\" said Gyuhwan Kim, 26, a software engineer from South Korea who got in line at 3.30am \"But no, I will not come this early. Once is enough.\"\n\nJordan Kaneshiro, a Honolulu native now working as a nurse in Omaha, said: \"It's just one of the things you have got to do. You buy shares of a company and you want to see what the company is up to.\"\n\nThat approach would survive Buffett's exit.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that time will come, perhaps soon, breaking out in laughter after telling shareholders: \"I not only hope that you come next year, I hope I come next year.\"\n\nRichard Callahan, a BMO banker from Omaha, said Buffett has become less visible locally.\n\n\"You just don't see him,\" he said. \"I live and work in the same neighbourhood. You don't see him out in his car as much, and once in a while you'll see him with a driver.\"\n\nBut the 57-year-old still marvels at Buffett. \"93?\" he said. \"I can only hope that I'm functioning as he is.\" -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type":

A large sale is an about-face for Buffett, who is normally tech-phobic but came to view Apple as a consumer goods company with strong pricing power and devoted customers. Some investors, however, have expressed concern that Apple consumed too much of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, has said that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder. The sales leave Warren Buffett with more than six times the minimum $30 billion cash cushion he has pledged to keep. Berkshire realized $11.2 billion of after-tax gains in the quarter from selling investments.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc announced its first quarter results on Saturday, May 4, reporting a record quarterly profit, boosted by a significant increase in income from insurance underwriting. The first-quarter operating profit rose 39 per cent to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe multinational conglomerate's income fell to $12.7 billion in the quarter-under-review, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5 billion, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks.

REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel and Koh Gui Qing\n\nOMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett will take center stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, as shareholders descend on to watch the famed investor as well as his expected successor.\n\nThe meeting is the 60th for Buffett, 93, since he took over Berkshire in 1965. He has largely stopped appearing publicly to discuss the company. He told investors in November that he felt good but knew he was \"playing in extra innings.\"\n\n\"It's just fun to be a part of it,\" said Jeff Farmer, a 59-year-old public safety worker from Omaha, at an exhibit hall where Berkshire wares were for sale on Friday. \"We just want to hear that the company is on the same trajectory and hear about what they are forecasting for the future.\"\n\nAt a downtown arena, Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61, will answer about five hours of questions. Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 72, will also join. Abel was designated Buffett's successor as chief executive in 2021.\n\n\"I want to hear from Greg Abel,\" said Min Zhuang, 51, who drove seven hours from Chicago to attend the meeting and has owned Berkshire shares for over a decade.\n\n\"I want to see what kind of person he is, what his vision is for the company and if it's different from Buffett's. I am not afraid of change.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on how the conglomerate will evolve as it faces challenges including how best to grow without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy the $167.6 billion of cash on hand at year-end.\n\nThe shareholder meeting is also the first since Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime friend, business partner and foil, died in November at age 99.\n\nMunger was known for laconic and acerbic comebacks to Buffett's often lengthy appraisals about Berkshire, the economy, Wall Street and life.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Warren to not have Charlie there,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management, attending his 32nd Berkshire meeting.\n\nSUCCESSION TOP OF MIND Berkshire is a $862 billion conglomerate with dozens of businesses including BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. It also owns well over $300 billion of stocks, close to half of which is Apple.\n\nIn the last year, Berkshire's stock is up 23%, trailing the Standard & Poor's 500's 25% gain. Over the last decade, Berkshire rose 218% compared with the S&P's 172% gain.\n\nBuffett is expected to face a wide array of questions on Saturday on everything from major investments such as Apple and Occidental Petroleum to how elevated interest rates have affected the company. \"I want to see Warren's energy,\" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, attending his 27th meeting. \"It's good that Greg and Ajit will be out front.\" Berkshire will on Saturday also release first-quarter results while shareholders will vote on six proposals about climate, diversity and China. Buffett opposes all six. The weekend features opportunities for shareholders to buy goodies such as Berkshire T-shirts and Squishmallows toys at exhibits featuring Berkshire-owned companies. Ruth Gearhart, 72, from Omaha, filled her bags with See's Candies plus tongs and spatulas from Pampered Chef. A 15-year shareholder, Gearhart said she was mainly concerned with what Buffett might say regarding his succession. \"I trust him,\" she said. \"He's a brilliant man and he has a lot of brilliant people. He will get us through this. I'd hate to see him go, but I think they prepared for it well.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gui Qing Koh and Jonathan Stempel; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies and Cynthia Osterman)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Berkshire realised $11.2 billion in after-tax gains during the quarter from investment sales.\n\nIn the first quarter, operating profit surged by 39 per cent to $11.22 billion, equating to approximately $7,807 per Class A share, up from $8.07 billion in the prior year. Net income, however, witnessed a 64 per cent decline to $12.7 billion, or $8,838 per share, compared to $35.5 billion in the previous year, primarily due to large unrealised gains reported in 2023.\n\nBuffett urges investors to disregard the resulting volatility driven by an accounting rule mandating Berkshire to report such gains with its financial results.\n\nAdditionally, Berkshire repurchased $2.6 billion worth of its own stock in the first quarter and a smaller amount in the initial three weeks of April.\n\nThe company's results were disclosed ahead of its annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, an event that attracts tens of thousands of attendees. Buffett, at 93 years old, has steered Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate encompassing diverse businesses such as Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Dairy Queen, and See's Candies.\n\nDespite recession concerns and apprehensions about the banking industry, Berkshire's diversified portfolio is often viewed by investors, including Buffett enthusiasts, as a stable long-term investment option.\n\nAmong its various businesses, Geico saw its insurance profit surge by 80 per cent, driven by substantial growth in underwriting profit attributed to rate hikes and a significant decrease in the percentage of premiums allocated for accident losses. Conversely, profit at the BNSF railroad dipped by 8 per cent, partly due to reduced fuel surcharges and an unfavourable business mix.\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway Energy experienced a 72 per cent profit increase, as improved operational performance from utilities mitigated rising legal expenses at the HomeServices of America real estate brokerage, associated with a nationwide settlement over brokerage commissions. Nevertheless, the energy division still confronts significant claims against its PacifiCorp unit stemming from Oregon wildfires in 2020.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)", "source": {"uri":

Berkshire did sell about 115 million Apple shares, about 13% of its stake. Based on the stock price, Berkshire's Apple stake ended the first quarter with 790 million shares.\n\nSo, why sell at all? Basically for tax reasons, Buffett said.\n\nApple's shares had risen 48% in 2023.\n\nApple's shares, however, fell nearly 11% during the quarter as well. They're up 7% since the end of March and 7.7% just since the end of April.\n\nBerkshire is up 11% this year but off 5% this quarter.\n\nRelated: Analysts weigh in on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has been a shareholder of Apple since 2016 when the late Charles Munger convinced Buffett it was a great stock to buy. Munger, Berkshire's long-time vice chairman, died in late 2023.\n\nThe investment has been fantastically successful for the company and Buffett still believes deeply in Apple.\n\nHe predicted the stock will still be Berkshire's biggest holding at the end of the year. And, he noted, Apple CEO Tim Cook was attending the meeting.\n\nSometimes, it's OK to pay taxes\n\nBuffett also suggested the share sale may be tied to his view that tax rates may possibly be going higher to fund a ballooning U.S. fiscal deficit.\n\nPaying the taxes in selling Apple didn't bother Buffett \"in the least.\"\n\nAnd he added, \"I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it -- and if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\"\n\nBerkshire's biggest holding\n\nApple remains still Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holding, representing about 40% of the value of the conglomerate's stock portfolio, which had a total value of about $335.9 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the portfolio was valued at $353.8 billion, with Apple representing about 49% of the portfolio's value.\n\nApple and stocks of four other companies represented about 75% of the value of the portfolio at the end of March The others are American Express (AXP) , Bank of America (BAC) , Coca Cola (KO) and Chevron (CVX) . That's down from 79% in December.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charley_blaine@bnd.com", "name": "Charley Blaine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/md9sz2/picture260743127/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/jim-cramer-on-warren-buffett-coach-kate-spade-sinclair-charter-comcast-disney-and-nvidia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

But they're not worried about their investments.\n\n\"The crowds will be smaller when Buffett isn't here, but the company will still do well,\" said Jason Garner, a 20-year-old student from Queens University in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nBerkshire is an $865 billion conglomerate whose dozens of companies include Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, many utilities, industrial businesses, and the maker of Ginsu knives.\n\nBuffett has run it from his hometown of Omaha since 1965. Despite Berkshire's size, its shares outgained the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last decade, though by less than they once did.\n\nMany who attended the weekend Buffett dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" expressed confidence, sometimes tinged with unease, about Berkshire's future without the legendary billionaire.\n\nThe death in November of Buffett's longtime business partner Charlie Munger at age 99 renewed focus on Buffett's own age.\n\nBuffett navigated almost five hours of shareholder questions in a downtown arena with his successor-in-waiting Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61.\n\nIn an adjacent exhibit hall featuring Berkshire companies, shareholders scooped up spatulas, jewelry, Squishmallows toys and several tons of See's Candies. Many posed for photos with the Geico gecko.\n\nA large number of shareholders came from across the globe.\n\n\"Warren said Berkshire is built to last,\" said Mike Lin, a financial analyst from Guangzhou, China, who with his sister bought Benjamin Moore teddy bears.\n\nLygia Bulle, a financial planner from Curitiba, Brazil, took her 17- and 19-year-old sons to the meeting.\n\n\"Warren Buffett is the greatest investor in the world,\" she said. \"Going to see him in person has a different impact from seeing him at home.\"\n\nBRAVING THE RAIN\n\nAs usual, thousands of shareholders lined up in the overnight hours Saturday to hear Buffett, despite rain and wind that shortened the lines. Some said people were waiting 12 hours before the arena's 7 a.m. opening.\n\nBuffett's fame, wisdom and magnetism are a big part of the draw. Abel won't command the same affection from shareholders though leaders of Berkshire's businesses say they regard him highly.\n\nNo one knows if the weekend will stay the same without Buffett. Omaha hopes so: no annual event other than baseball's College World Series matters more to its economy.\n\n\"Yes, I will be back if Warren Buffett isn't here because I will wonder about Berkshire Hathaway's future,\" said Gyuhwan Kim, 26, a software engineer from South Korea who got in line at 3:30 a.m. \"But no, I will not come this early. Once is enough.\"\n\nJordan Kaneshiro, a Honolulu native now working as a nurse in Omaha, said: \"It's just one of the things you have got to do. You buy shares of a company and you want to see what the company is up to.\"\n\nThat approach would survive Buffett's exit.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that time will come, perhaps soon, breaking out in laughter after telling shareholders: \"I not only hope that you come next year, I hope I come next year.\"\n\nRichard Callahan, a BMO banker from Omaha, said Buffett has become less visible locally.\n\n\"You just don't see him,\" he said. \"I live and work in the same neighborhood. You don't see him out in his car as much, and once in a while you'll see him with a driver.\"\n\nBut the 57-year-old still marvels at Buffett. \"93?\" he said. \"I can only hope that I'm functioning as he is.\"\n\n(Reporting by Koh Gui Qing and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha; Editing by Diane Craft)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors":

Buffett, prepares to speak at its annual investor meeting.\n\nThose results belie an increase in operating earnings, which track the actual profits that Berkshire's array of companies produce, and in Berkshire's formidable cash hoard -- which totaled nearly $189 billion as of March 31 -- that points to the company's robust health.\n\nThe company's latest results set a backdrop for the meeting in downtown Omaha, which will be the first for Berkshire since the death in November of Charles Munger, Mr. Buffett's longtime business partner and alter ego, at age 99.\n\nFor the first three months of the year, Berkshire reported $12.7 billion in earnings attributable to its shareholders, down 64 percent from the same time a year ago. Driving the drop was a steep fall in the paper value of Berkshire's vast investment portfolio though Mr. Buffett has long warned shareholders to ignore fluctuations in the company's stock holdings.\n\nBerkshire also disclosed that it had trimmed its huge stake in Apple, which Mr. Buffett has called one of his company's most important holdings, by about 13 percent in the quarter. It now owns about $135.4 billion, down from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023. (Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, is attending the annual meeting.)\n\nLooking at operating earnings, Mr. Buffett's favored metric because it measures the tangible health of Berkshire's business, the company reported a 40 percent gain, to $11.2 billion. That was propelled by a more than doubling of Berkshire's core insurance underwriting business, as its Geico insurer charged higher premiums per policy and reported fewer claims, while its reinsurance division didn't take any hits from catastrophes in this year's first quarter.\n\nThose gains offset weaker results in other parts of Mr. Buffett's empire, including an 8 percent fall in net earnings at the BNSF railroad because of lower shipments of fuel versus consumer goods and lower fuel surcharge revenue.\n\nIts Pilot Travel Centers chain of truck stops, which it acquired full control of in January, reported a 19 percent drop in net earnings, as the business saw lower margins on fuel sales and higher operating expenses.\n\nAnd Berkshire disclosed that its PacifiCorp utility, which operates in the West, faces federal and state investigations and lawsuits over any role it played in wildfires in 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe earnings report was released ahead of the Berkshire meeting, which will see tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders gather at the CHI Health Center arena in the company's hometown to watch Mr. Buffett answer questions.\n\nAmong the topics that he will probably discuss -- some with the help of his top lieutenants, including his likely successor, Gregory Abel -- are his outlook on the economy and the November elections and where he sees investment opportunities.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type":

Despite selling around 115 million shares, however, Buffett reaffirmed his commitment to AAPL going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Tim Cook, who made the trip to Omaha for Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday, praised Buffett for his belief in Apple.\n\nAs reported by CNBC, Berkshire's Q1 2024 earnings report revealed that its stake in Apple is now worth $135.4 billion - indicating that it holds around 790 million shares. Based on Apple's stock price, this would mean Berkshire sold about 115 million shares, CNBC says.\n\nStill, Apple is Berkshire's largest holding by a wide margin. Likewise, Berkshire is Apple's largest shareholder outside of ETF providers.\n\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett praised Apple and said it's an \"an even better business\" than two of the conglomerate's other major holdings, American Express and Coca-Cola. Buffett also assured investors: \"Unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nBuffett didn't offer specific details on why Berkshire sold 13% of its Apple holdings in the quarter. He did, however, imply that it was to increase its cash stake for tax purposes:\n\n\"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it and if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\"\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook was in the audience of Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on Saturday. With regard to Berkshire's decision to offload some of its Apple holdings, Cook told CNBC that \"it's a privilege to have them as a shareholder.\"\n\nWhen Berkshire sold 10 million shares of AAPL in 2020, Buffett later admitted that the decision \"was probably a mistake.\" In Q4 2023, Berkshire offloaded around 1% of its AAPL holdings (10 million shares), so this marks the second consecutive quarter that the conglomerate reduced its stake in Apple.", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chance_miller@9to5mac.com", "name": "Chance Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/Warren-Buffett-AAPL.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a steep drop in earnings Saturday as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of shareholders looked forward to hearing from Buffett directly, buoyed by a jump in performance of the many companies Berkshire operates directly.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBuffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' strong performance.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Holdings in the iPhone maker are still Berkshire's biggest stake, making up $135.4 billion of the company's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years, even when his successor Greg Abel eventually takes over.\n\nAs for Berkshire's core insurance businesses, the conglomerate reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of Bershire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profit at the utility unit that added $717 million to earnings.\n\nCash on hand rose to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nTHOUSANDS ATTEND 'WOODSTOCK FOR CAPITALISTS'\n\nTens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured classic skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, attending dinner parties, meetings and regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nTHE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. Abel and Jain shared the main stage with Buffett for the first time this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nANYTHING AND EVERYTHING\n\nAs always, Buffett addressed a variety of topics Saturday, though he never talks politics or reveals what he is buying. The stock he has been buying over the past year will remain a secret until he's required to disclose it in filings.\n\nHe described a recent uneasy experience with artificial intelligence, saying he saw a fake image of himself delivering a message in his voice about something he said he would never say. He predicted the technology will be a boon for scammers, and he's not sure if it will do more good than harm. The fake video was so convincing Buffett said he might have sent money to himself overseas.\n\n\"It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nOn climate change, Jain said it's creating larger losses for insurance companies and driving up prices. It's hard to know if prices are increasing enough to handle the risk, but at least insurers have the opportunity to recalibrate their premiums each year, Jain said.\n\n\"We get a lot of letters from people concerned about climate change -- and I don't think they're wrong,\" Buffett said. \"But they don't understand the insurance business.\"\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. The 93-year-old says he hardly gets any calls from managers any more because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said. ___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

Buffett informed shareholders that his chosen successors, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, were well-prepared to lead the conglomerate when he steps down.\n\nIn a tribute to his late business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett reflected on the company's growth under their stewardship. With Berkshire's cash reserves hitting a record $189 billion, Buffett expressed his expectation for continued growth. The AGM was Buffett's 60th, showcasing his remarkable tenure since 1965, during which he transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile company into a massive conglomerate worth $862 billion, with holdings in various sectors. Buffett highlighted Abel and Jain's competence, stating, \"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?\"\n\nApple stake cut no hurdle\n\nDespite Berkshire trimming its stake in Apple by about 13 per cent ahead of the meeting, Buffett praised the tech giant, considering it \"an even better business\" than some of Berkshire's long-standing investments. He lauded the iPhone as one of the greatest products of all time, emphasising Apple's strong market position and customer loyalty. The decision to reduce its Apple stake contributed to Berkshire's cash pile soaring, reaching a potential $200 billion this quarter. Buffett cited concerns over high stock market valuations and geopolitical tensions as reasons for the increase in cash reserves.\n\nAbel also addressed challenges, pledging to combat lawsuits against Berkshire's PacifiCorp utility unit over Oregon wildfires. Despite these legal battles, shareholders reelected all 14 Berkshire directors and rejected six shareholder proposals.\n\nThe meeting attracted thousands of shareholders, underscoring Buffett's enduring appeal as an investment guru. Shareholders lined up in advance, eager to gain insights from Buffett's perspectives on various topics, including investment strategies and life philosophies. The AGM proved to be a platform to reassure shareholders about Berkshire's future leadership, discuss financial performance, and provide insights into Buffett's investment philosophy.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stewardship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PacifiCorp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PacifiCorp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/omar-rodriguez-gjol79qjfd8-unsplash-171255839374316_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

In addition to the headline revenue and earnings numbers, investors always watch Berkshire's cash stockpile, buyback activity, and the operating income from its subsidiary businesses.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a rundown of the key numbers, a major investment move that was revealed, and the important information we don't know yet.\n\nWarren Buffett himself has cautioned investors not to pay too much attention to the company's net income (earnings per share, or EPS), as it includes unrealized investment gains and losses from Berkshire's massive stock portfolio. That's especially true for the first quarter, as an excellent first quarter of 2023 resulted in an EPS decline of 64% -- even though Berkshire's business performed quite well, as we'll see in the next section.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew by 5%, and it's worth noting that both the top and bottom-line numbers came in significantly higher than analysts had been expecting.\n\nBerkshire's operating earnings tell us how the company's subsidiary businesses are performing, and these look great. Overall, Berkshire's operating earnings grew by 39% year over year.\n\nMuch of this strong performance was due to the insurance business. Underwriting income nearly tripled year over year, and investment income grew by 32%, mainly due to the rising interest rate environment over the past year. Berkshire Hathaway Energy operating earnings rose by 72% year over year. The only significant decline was an 8% year-over-year drop in BNSF Railroad's operating earnings, but the rest of Berkshire's business more than made up for it.\n\nOne of the most important things investors should know about Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly reports is what isn't revealed.\n\nSpecifically, while Berkshire reports the cost basis of its massive stock portfolio from quarter to quarter, we generally don't know what stocks Berkshire bought or sold (with few exceptions) until its 13-F is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This quarter's filing is due on May 15, so we'll get an updated snapshot of Berkshire's portfolio as it stood on March 31.\n\nHowever, Berkshire reports the market value of its largest stock positions as of the end of the quarter. Judging by these, it appears that Berkshire unloaded about 13% of its massive Apple (AAPL 5.98%) investment during the first quarter. This would certainly explain the rapid growth in the cash stockpile, as well as the realized investment gains of $11.2 billion Berkshire mentioned in its earnings release.\n\nBerkshire's buyback activity is always of interest to shareholders, as it provides insight into whether Buffett thinks the company's stock is attractive. While a price below intrinsic value is a requirement for buybacks to take place at all, the pace of buybacks has varied widely over the past few years.\n\nThe first-quarter earnings report shows that Berkshire spent $2.6 billion on buybacks, including both Class A and Class B shares.\n\nFor context, Berkshire repurchased $2.2 billion of its shares in the fourth quarter of 2023 and spent $9.2 billion throughout the entirety of last year. So, the first quarter represents a bit of an acceleration.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Berkshire's cash stockpile soared to an all-time high of $167.6 billion. Simply put, Buffett has found it difficult to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in recent years, and with short-term Treasuries yielding about 5% on Berkshire's idle cash, Buffett is in no rush to pull the trigger.\n\nTo say that Berkshire's cash hoard grew in the first quarter would be an understatement. Including cash, equivalents, and short-term Treasury Bills, Berkshire now has a staggering $189 billion on its balance sheet.\n\nFinally, the earnings report was released on the morning of Berkshire's widely followed annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The meeting includes hours of Q&A with Warren Buffett and the heads of Berkshire's insurance and non-insurance operations, so there's likely to be some new information (and investment wisdom) shared throughout the day. We may even find out why Buffett sold a significant amount of Apple.

Buffett said he expects it to remain so even up to when his successor Greg Abel takes over.\n\nThe estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares.

The Oracle of Omaha on Saturday told an arena full of shareholders that his designated successor Greg Abel will have the final say on all of Berkshire's investment decisions when Buffett is no longer at the helm. \"I would leave the capital allocation to Greg ... he understands businesses extremely well,\" Buffett said. \"If you understand businesses, you'll understand common stocks.\" That single comment sparked a lot of conversation among Buffett's loyal followers. Some interpreted it to mean that Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will not only make acquisitions in the future, but will also pick stocks for Berkshire's $360 billion equity portfolio. Others think Abel will be more likely to delegate the responsibility of stock selection. \"I think he wanted to leave room for Abel to make his own decisions in terms of who will make stock portfolio decisions, how much of the investment portfolio to allocate to stocks and so on,\" Haruki Toyama, portfolio manager at Madison Investments, a Berkshire shareholder, told CNBC. \"Buffett has always said that the CEO needs to be the 'chief risk officer' at any firm, and for that to be the case, there has to be clear accountability at the top,\" Toyama added. Buffett's investment lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have independently managed about $15 billion each for Berkshire over the past decade. Many had speculated that those two former hedge fund managers would eventually take over the entire portfolio. Buffett hasn't disclosed their track record in recent years, however. The pair have also been helping Berkshire close deals. Additionally, Combs is the CEO of Geico, the crown jewel of Berkshire's insurance business. \"The Abel news was a twist on the view that the duties would be split between capital allocation and stock selection,\" said Bill Stone, Berkshire shareholder and CIO at Glenview Trust who was attending his 20th Berkshire annual meeting. 'Used to think differently' Abel, 61, became known as Buffett's heir apparent in 2021 after Charlie Munger inadvertently made the revelation at that year's shareholder meeting. Abel has been overseeing large swaths of Berkshire's sprawling empire, including energy, railroad and retail, but is known for his expertise in energy, having worked at the predecessor of Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 1992. Buffett, who's turning 94 in August, admitted himself that he's changed his mind about the succession plan, noting that his decision is influenced by how much Berkshire's assets have grown. \"I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think that responsibility should be that of the CEO and whatever that CEO decides may be helpful,\" Buffett said. \"The sums have grown so large at Berkshire, and we do not want to try and have 200 people around that are managing a billion each. It just doesn't work.\" In addition to Berkshire's enormous equity portfolio, its pile of cash grew to nearly $189 billion at the end of March. Bueffett's \"answer .... was significant in that it consolidates a lot of power around Abel,\" Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA, said in a note. \"Throughout the meeting several questions related to succession-related issues arose. I clearly got the sense that the firm was sensitive to this issue.\" 'Will not miss a beat' The immediate reaction in the stock market was positive. Class A shares climbed 0.6% on Monday following the weekend headlines, including succession, a surge in operating earnings and the record cash hoard. UBS Berkshire analyst Brian Meredith, one of the only few on Wall Street covering the conglomerate, gave a vote of confidence after the annual meeting. BRK.A 1Y mountain Berkshire Hathaway \"While we believe BRK's shares may go down some when Buffett is no longer CEO, it is clear to us that fundamentally BRK will not miss a beat with Greg Abel currently taking on most of the CEO responsibilities,\" he said in a note on Monday. Meredith also hiked his price target on Omaha-based Berkshire, seeing Class A shares rising to $734,820 from $722,234 previously. The new forecast would translate into more than 20% upside and push Berkshire's total market value above $1 trillion. \"We continue to believe BRK's shares are an attractive play in an uncertain macro environment. We estimate shares trade at a ~8% discount to intrinsic value,\" Meredith said. -- CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"},

And if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said.\n\nBuffett said the ultimate decision would lie with the board but he did warn that he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nAlready the two top executives take virtually all of the calls from the managers of Berkshire Hathaway businesses.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said, although many shareholders and other investors would certainly miss the folksy words of wisdom and humility of the man who is without doubt the greatest investor of recent times.", "source": {"uri": "smallcaps.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Small Caps"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_beveridge@smallcaps.com.au", "name": "John Beveridge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://smallcapsau.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warren-Buffett-warns-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Berkshire-Hathaway-cash-pile-200-billion.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Buffett said for the first time Saturday that Greg Abel should also take responsibility for the company's investments after he takes over, raising new questions about the succession plan. Abel put his encyclopedic knowledge of the utility business that he led directly for years on display and delved into railroad operations and potential acquisitions that Berkshire pursued while sharing the stage with Buffett all day. For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp. Observers said even if Abel is going at evaluating businesses, stock picking isn't easy.\n\nLawsuit against Meta asks if Facebook users have right to control their feeds using external tools\n\nDo social media users have the right to control what they see -- or don't see -- on their feeds? A lawsuit filed against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is arguing that a federal law often used to shield internet companies from liability also allows people to use external tools to take control of their feed -- even if that means shutting it off entirely. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Meta Platforms on behalf of an Amherst professor who wants to release a tool to let users unfollow all the content fed to them by Facebook's algorithm.\n\nWarren Buffett says AI may be better for scammers than society. And he's seen how\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett has come face to face with the downside of AI. And it looks just like him. The billionaire investing guru told tens of thousands of shareholders at his annual conference in Omaha that he recently saw an AI video of himself, complete with a perfect voiceover, giving fake advice. It was so convincing, he says, he can see how people would fall for the scam. Buffett spent all day Saturday answering shareholder questions at his first annual meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died. The absence offered shareholders the chance to hear more from the next generation of leaders who will take over after Buffett is gone.\n\nBerkshire's profit plunges 64% on portfolio holdings as Buffett sells Apple\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway says its first quarter profit plummeted on the paper value of its investments. At the same time, the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright did well. A few hours before shareholders got the chance to hear from CEO Warren Buffett at the annual meeting in Omaha, Berkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down roughly one-third from a year ago. The biggest news is that Berkshire sold off about 13% of its massive Apple stake, though the iphone maker remains Berkshire's biggest single investment and Buffett says he plans to keep it.\n\nBoeing locks out its private firefighters around Seattle over pay dispute\n\nBoeing has locked out its private force of firefighters who protect its aircraft-manufacturing plants in the Seattle area and brought in replacements after the latest round of negotiations with the firefighters' union failed to deliver an agreement on wages. The company said Saturday that it locked out about 125 firefighters and a facility about 170 miles away in central Washington. The firefighters serve as first responders to fires and medical emergencies and can call in help from local departments. Boeing says its firefighters were paid $91,000 on average last year. The International Association of Fire Fighters says they are paid far less than crews at local fire departments in the Seattle area.\n\nWarren Buffett's company rejects proposals, but it faces lawsuit over how it handled one last year\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Shareholder proposals are usually uneventful at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, but Warren Buffett and the company are now facing a lawsuit over the way one presenter was treated last year. Peter Flaherty with the National Legal and Policy Center came back with another proposal this year asking Berkshire to produce a report on the risk of doing business in China after he was cut off in the middle of his presentation last year and arrested for trespassing. The charges were later dropped, but Flaherty decided to sue. He said he had never had trouble at dozens of meetings he has presented at since 2005, including Berkshire's 2022 meeting. Flaherty's proposal was one of six rejected Saturday after Berkshire and Buffett opposed them all.\n\nUS employers scaled back hiring in April. How that could let the Fed cut interest rates\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's employers pulled back on their hiring in April but still added a decent 175,000 jobs in a sign that persistently high interest rates may be starting to slow the robust U.S. job market. Last month's hiring gain was down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March. Yet the moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown last month in wage growth, will likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates at a two-decade high to fight persistently elevated inflation. Hourly wages rose a less-than-expected 0.2% from March and 3.9% from a year earlier, the smallest annual gain since June 2021.\n\nStock market today: Wall Street rallies after hiring shows welcome signs of cooling\n\nStocks closed sharply higher on Wall Street, erasing their losses for the week, after the government reported a cooldown in hiring last month. For markets that was a welcome sign that the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight inflation by slowing the economy with high interest rates might be making some progress. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% Friday, its biggest gain since February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2%. U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month, down sharply from a big increase in March. Apple jumped after announcing a mammoth $110 billion stock buyback.\n\nGoogle, Justice Department make final arguments about whether search engine is a monopoly\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and Google are making their closing arguments in a high-stakes antitrust trial to a federal judge in Washington who must now decide whether the tech giant's search engine constitutes an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department argued Friday that Google's preeminence as an internet search engine is an illegal monopoly propped up by more than $20 billion spent each year by the tech giant to lock out competition. Google argues that its ubiquity flows from its superior product and its ability to deliver consumers the results that it's looking for. A final ruling in the case is expected later this year.\n\nUS loosens some electric vehicle battery rules, potentially making more EVs eligible for tax credits\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin says new rules governing electric vehicle tax credits are a giveaway to China. Manchin, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said that exemptions in the new rules effectively endorse the idea that EVs will be \"made in China.\" The comments came as the Treasury Department loosened some rules governing EV tax credits a bit, potentially making more EVs eligible for credits of up to $7,500. The rule are aimed at juicing demand for EVs in an effort to reach a Biden administration goal that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com",

As a result the value of its stock portfolio slipped to $336 billion, from $354 billion at year-end.\n\nThe filing with US securities regulators indicated that Berkshire had sold a significant portion of its stake in Apple, which had become a core holding for the Omaha-based business since one of Buffett's deputies first invested in 2016.\n\nThe company said its position in the iPhone maker was worth $135.4 billion in the first quarter, down from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, suggesting it had sold more than 100 million shares in the company at the start of the year. Berkshire started to pare its holdings in Apple in late December, selling roughly 10 million shares.\n\nBuffett has long heaped praise on Apple's management team and in 2022 he described the company as one of Berkshire's \"four giants\", alongside its insurance operations, the BNSF railroad and its energy and utility business Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\n\nTim Cook, Apple's chief executive, told CNBC that Buffett had told him about the stock sales on Friday. Cook added that it was still \"a privilege to have Berkshire as a shareholder\".\n\nThe figures come as Berkshire shareholders gather in Omaha, Nebraska, for the company's annual meeting, dubbed the Woodstock of capitalism. It is the first time Buffett will take to the stage since his longtime business partner Charlie Munger died in November.\n\nBerkshire reported solid earnings in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by improvements in its insurance businesses as well as a boost from higher interest rates. Operating profits across the company jumped 39 percent from the year before to $11.2 billion.\n\nThe company disclosed that its auto insurer Geico had passed along higher rates to customers and had suffered fewer claims, lifting its results. The unit has scaled back its footprint since the pandemic after it suffered a period of losses.\n\nAuto insurers across the US had struggled with the high replacement costs of new cars, exacerbated by supply chain issues and surging inflation.\n\nGeico, which is led by one of Buffett's top investment deputies, cut millions of policies in a drive to return to profitability. The move has been successful. Pre-tax profits at Geico more than doubled from a year ago to $1.93 billion. The unit also signalled its retrenchment could be near its end, saying that \"the rate of decline\" had slowed and it was winning new business.\n\nThe company has also benefited from the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in a bid to quell inflationary pressures. Berkshire said it earned $1.9 billion in the quarter in interest income from its cash pile, which is largely invested in short-term Treasuries.\n\nOver the past year, it has earned almost $7 billion on that portfolio.\n\nOverall, Berkshire said it generated a net profit of $12.7 billion in the first quarter, down 64 percent from $35.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nBuffett has long discouraged his shareholders from relying on the company's net income figures -- calling them \"meaningless\" -- as they are affected by swings in value of its stock portfolio from quarter to quarter. It can result in huge losses or profits that do not reflect the underlying business performance.\n\nBerkshire's results are typically pored over by investors, given the company employs nearly 400,000 people and touches almost every part of the US economy. The results were generally upbeat and pointed to an improving US outlook.\n\nSales at Precision Castparts, an aeroplane parts manufacturer that supplies Boeing, jumped 10 percent to $2.5 billion. Sales at Berkshire's home building group, which includes the modular home builder Clayton Homes and roofing maker Johns Manville, also rose.\n\nThe BNSF railroad's revenues fell 4.1 percent, almost entirely driven by lower shipments of coal. The unit, which has more than 32,000 miles of track criss-crossing the US, said it had shipped more consumer and agriculture products than previously.\n\nShares of Berkshire have climbed 11 percent this year, outpacing the 8 percent total return of the S&P 500. Berkshire has not paid a dividend since the 1960s.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But they're not worried about their investments.\n\n\"The crowds will be smaller when Buffett isn't here, but the company will still do well,\" said Jason Garner, a 20-year-old student from Queens University in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nBerkshire is an $865 billion conglomerate whose dozens of companies include Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, many utilities, industrial businesses, and the maker of Ginsu knives.\n\nBuffett has run it from his hometown of Omaha since 1965. Despite Berkshire's size, its shares outgained the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last decade, though by less than they once did.\n\nMany who attended the weekend Buffett dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" expressed confidence, sometimes tinged with unease, about Berkshire's future without the legendary billionaire.\n\nThe death in November of Buffett's longtime business partner Charlie Munger at age 99 renewed focus on Buffett's own age.\n\nBuffett navigated almost five hours of shareholder questions in a downtown arena with his successor-in-waiting Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61.\n\nIn an adjacent exhibit hall featuring Berkshire companies, shareholders scooped up spatulas, jewelry, Squishmallows toys and several tons of See's Candies. Many posed for photos with the Geico gecko.\n\nA large number of shareholders came from across the globe.\n\n\"Warren said Berkshire is built to last,\" said Mike Lin, a financial analyst from Guangzhou, China, who with his sister bought Benjamin Moore teddy bears.\n\nLygia Bulle, a financial planner from Curitiba, Brazil, took her 17- and 19-year-old sons to the meeting.\n\n\"Warren Buffett is the greatest investor in the world,\" she said. \"Going to see him in person has a different impact from seeing him at home.\"\n\nBRAVING THE RAIN\n\nAs usual, thousands of shareholders lined up in the overnight hours Saturday to hear Buffett, despite rain and wind that shortened the lines. Some said people were waiting 12 hours before the arena's 7 a.m. opening.\n\nBuffett's fame, wisdom and magnetism are a big part of the draw. Abel won't command the same affection from shareholders though leaders of Berkshire's businesses say they regard him highly.\n\nNo one knows if the weekend will stay the same without Buffett. Omaha hopes so: no annual event other than baseball's College World Series matters more to its economy.\n\n\"Yes, I will be back if Warren Buffett isn't here because I will wonder about Berkshire Hathaway's future,\" said Gyuhwan Kim, 26, a software engineer from South Korea who got in line at 3:30 a.m. \"But no, I will not come this early. Once is enough.\"\n\nJordan Kaneshiro, a Honolulu native now working as a nurse in Omaha, said: \"It's just one of the things you have got to do. You buy shares of a company and you want to see what the company is up to.\"\n\nThat approach would survive Buffett's exit.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that time will come, perhaps soon, breaking out in laughter after telling shareholders: \"I not only hope that you come next year, I hope I come next year.\"\n\nRichard Callahan, a BMO banker from Omaha, said Buffett has become less visible locally.\n\n\"You just don't see him,\" he said. \"I live and work in the same neighborhood. You don't see him out in his car as much, and once in a while you'll see him with a driver.\"\n\nBut the 57-year-old still marvels at Buffett. \"93?\" he said. \"I can only hope that I'm functioning as he is.\"\n\n(Reporting by Koh Gui Qing and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha; Editing by Diane Craft)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

Abel is set to be the next CEO after Warren Buffett is gone.\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Tens of thousands of investors once again descended on an Omaha, Nebraska, arena Saturday to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett. But a key ingredient will be missing from his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders' meeting: It's the first since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\n\"He was the sriracha sauce in the Berkshire Hathaway meeting,\" said investor Bill Smead, a regular at the event for 14 years. \"He gave it a lot of flavor.\"\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nSaturday is set to kick off with the company releasing its first quarter earnings a couple of hours before the meeting. In addition to its biggest interests, Berkshire Hathaway owns a vast collection of manufacturing and retail businesses, including Dairy Queen and See's Candy. Its massive stock portfolio is anchored by huge stakes in companies including Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

David A. Grogen | CNBCOMAHA, Nebraska -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut its gigantic Apple stake in the first quarter as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" continued to downsize his one-time favorite bet.In its first-quarter earnings report, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its Apple bet was worth $135.4 billion, implying around 790 million shares. That would mark a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshire's biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter.This is the second quarter in a row that the Omaha-based conglomerate has trimmed the stake in the iPhone maker. It sold about 10 million Apple shares (just 1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. This filing, when accounting for the change in Apple's stock price, would imply Berkshire sold about 116 million shares.Buffett became a big fan of Apple after one of his investing managers Ted Weschler or Todd Combs convinced him to buy the stock years ago. Buffett even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire's cluster of insurers. [embedded content]AppleMany has speculated that the 93-year-old investing icon reduced his favorite stake due to valuation concerns. Apple's stock gained a whopping 48% in 2023 as megacap tech shares led the market rally. At its peak, Apple ballooned in Berkshire's equity portfolio, taking up 50% of it. The shares are trading at more than 27 times forward earnings.Shares of the iPhone maker got a big boost in the past week after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. The shares are down more than 4% so far this year amid concerns about how it will revive growth.It's not without precedent that the Berkshire CEO would adjust the Apple bet. He sold a bit of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2020, but Buffett admitted then that it was \"probably a mistake.\" Also it's not usual for Buffett to trim a position that has grown so large.Even with the sale, Berkshire is still Apple's largest shareholder outside of exchange-traded fund providers. ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The move quickly became one of the biggest topics as the meeting unfolded, even though Berkshire had sold some shares in Apple during the quarter before.\n\nDespite the sale, Apple is \"even better\" than American Express and Coca-Cola, which are \"wonderful\" businesses Berkshire also owns, Buffett told the crowd of thousands in Omaha. Unless something changes dramatically, Apple will remain its largest investment, he said, hinting that tax implications had motivated the sale. The iPhone may be one of the greatest products of all time, Buffett added.\n\nApple has faced a slew of headwinds -- a $2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project among them. Shares in the company are down about 5 per cent this year.\n\nThe sale bolstered Berkshire's cash pile, which climbed to a record $189 billion at the end of March. Given current market conditions -- where rate cuts are uncertain, inflation remains elevated and geopolitical risks abound -- Buffett said he didn't mind amassing the cash and said it could reach $200 billion by the end of the quarter.\n\nThe cash hoard also benefited from higher interest rates, earning $1.9 billion of interest income compared to $1.1 billion during the same quarter a year prior.\n\nBerkshire's cash pile has grown amid a dearth of sizable deals. Buffett said on Saturday he's been unable to find recent acquisitions that would \"move the needle\" for the firm.

But that's not all that's inflating.\n\nThe Omaha, Nebraska, investment conglomerate reported that its cash pile reached a record $189 billion in the first quarter, continuing a trend from this time last year: Warren Buffett & Co. just aren't into that many companies these days.\n\nThe 93-year-old Buffett, who allowed Coca-Cola to slap a caricature of his likeness on cans for free when the soda maker launched Cherry Coke (his favorite) in China in 2017, remains as lighthearted and goofy as ever.\n\nAnd business isn't bad either -- Berkshire has outpaced the 8% return of the S&P 500 in 2024, while first-quarter operating profit rose 39% to a record $11.2 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, Berkshire sold just under $20 billion worth of stock and bought only $2.7 billion over the first quarter, which drove the total value of its stock portfolio lower to $336 billion from $354 billion at the end of 2023. In the new world of AI-this-and-that, miracle weight-loss drugs, and peskily high interest rates, Buffett sees a lot of meh, and seems more than happy to let Berkshire's cash pile up. \"I don't think anyone sitting at this table has any idea how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,\" Buffett said:\n\nPoor Paramount: Berkshire also dumped its entire Paramount Global stake, which amounted to roughly 10% of the company, with Buffett saying it came at a loss without specifying the amount. \"It was 100% my decision and we've sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money,\" Buffett told investors. \"I did it all by myself, folks.\" Luckily for Berkshire shareholders, that choice came from the same guy whose stock has beaten the S&P 500 by 40 percentage points over the last 10 years.

For years, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has had a rock star-like presence in the investing world, and his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, which was held this weekend, draws thousands of loyal investors.\n\nWarren Buffett remains one of the world's most prominent investors, renowned for his unique long buy-and-hold strategies and extensive public and private portfolio. Seasoned investors and Buffett enthusiasts are well-acquainted with his famous quote, \"His favorite holding for an S&P 500 stock is forever.\"\n\nWell, it appears that will not be the case with his largest holding, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). Doug McIntyre and I predicted recently on a 24/7 Wall St. podcast that he would likely start selling stock as China business has stalled, iPhone sales have dropped, and Apple is perceived as having little, if any, Artificial Intelligence exposure. We also noted that the shares could crater if he tried to move too much at once.\n\nWhy are we covering this?\n\nWe have spent almost 15 years at 24/7 Wall St. covering Warren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRKA) portfolio. We felt it would be a very good idea to inform our readers, if they owned either Berkshire Hathaway or Apple, about the massive change in holdings in the legacy tech giant.\n\nIt's almost hard to comprehend that the legacy technology giant, with 905,560,000 shares, at one point made up 45% of the Berkshire Hataway portfolio and held nearly 6% of Apple's stock even after selling 10 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nHow much Apple Does Berkshire Hathaway still own?\n\nBased on published reports and some changes in the price of Apple stock, Mr. Buffett sold about 115 million shares of the stock, which translated to approximately 13% of its holdings in the company. That would still leave the remaining position to be a staggering 790 million shares.\n\nWhy would Buffett sell the stock now?\n\nMany investors and Wall Street analysts have stated publicly that the position was way too big for Berkshire Hathaway, and the concentration put the rest of the fund and its investors at risk. Warren Buffett, for years, avoided technology stocks claiming he didn't understand many of them, so the massive position, like the sale, was a surprise to many.\n\nDidn't Apple report strong quarterly results?\n\nApple posted second quarter results that beat lowered estimates, but the disclosure that iPhone sales had tumbled 10% and overall revenue was down 4% didn't sit well with many. In addition the company announced a massive $110 billion share buyback plan, which is the largest in the company's history. One could surmise that it is very possible that Warren Buffett could negotiate an off-the-floor trade or cross with the company to liquidate even more stock without hammering the stock price.\n\nWhat happens next for Warren Buffett and Apple?\n\nWith the big position at the start of the year, and Apple stock trading down the entire first quarter it's clear that Berkshire Hathaway was selling stock into any strength, and while the value of the position declined 22% from the end of 2023 while Apple was only down 11%, the company still printed a massive $11.2 billion after tax gain, much of that from the gains in Apple stock.\n\nAfter the sales in Apple and other holdings the cash position at Berkshire Hathaway has swollen to a remarkable $180 billion and could be as high as $200 billion by the end of the second quarter. At that level it would be almost seven times the minimum $30 billion cash position Mr. Buffett has said he would always maintain. You can bet the lions shares of the cash will go into 6 month and one year Treasury debt that yield 5.37% and 5.13% respectively.", "source": {"uri": "247wallst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "24/7 Wall St."}, "authors": [{"uri": "lee_jackson@247wallst.com", "name": "Lee Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imageforentry153.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' strong performance.\n\nBy that measure, Berkshire beat expectations of the three analysts surveyed by FactSet Research, who predicted operating earnings of $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Holdings in the iPhone maker are still Berkshire's biggest stake, making up $135.4 billion of the company's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects Apple to remain the biggest investment for years, even when his successor, Greg Abel, eventually takes over.\n\nAs for Berkshire's core insurance businesses, the conglomerate reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago.\n\nBNSF railroad's profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion, but most of Bershire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profit at the utility unit that added $717 million to earnings.\n\nCash on hand rose to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nTens of thousands filled the arena eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nIt's the first annual shareholder meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured classic skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, attending dinner parties, meetings and regular Zoom calls.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners.\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests.\n\nMunger often summed up the key to Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\"\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nTags The Economy Finance Business Accounting Entertainment

Buffett maintained that he doesn't mind paying taxes.\n\nFirst-quarter operating profit rose 39pc to $11.22bn, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07bn a year earlier.\n\n\"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said in a research note.\n\nNet income fell 64pc to $12.7bn, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5bn a year earlier, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks.\n\nAn accounting rule requires Berkshire to report those gains with its financial results. Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.\n\nBerkshire also repurchased $2.6bn of its own stock in the first quarter, and a small amount in the first three weeks of April.\n\nThe results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.\n\nBuffett, 93, has led Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate whose dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Dairy Queen and See's Candies.\n\nThe diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.\n\nInsurance profit soared 80pc to $5.2bn. This included a more than doubling of underwriting profit at Geico, which benefited from rate increases and a large decline in the percentage of premiums it used to pay for accident losses.\n\nProfit fell 8pc at the BNSF railroad, in part because of lower fuel surcharges and an \"unfavourable business mix.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy saw profit rise 72pc, as improved operating performance from

For decades, tens of thousands of moneyed investors have flocked from across the world to the Nebraskan city for a jamboree hosted by corporate America's answer to Lennon and McCartney.\n\nBuffett and Charlie Munger - who died last year, aged 99 - amassed a legion of followers by transforming Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textiles manufacturer into a sprawling global conglomerate - and generating handsome returns for shareholders along the way.\n\nHis empire, which includes a manufactured-housing business accused of exploitation, and gigantic investments in fossil fuels, is not without controversy. But to his investors, Buffett and Mungers have long been heroes.\n\n\"They've made me a lot of money over the years,\" said Blivas. Buffett, in his view, is \"the greatest of all time\" - and \"might not be around too much longer\". When the time comes for a new generation to take charge, Blivas does not plan to turn up at 4am, as he did this weekend.\n\nMunger's death in November marked the end of an era, and after more than half a century, Berkshire is steeling disciples for the next chapter. Addressing the company's latest annual meeting this weekend, he declared that its structure as a company, designed by Munger, \"lived beyond his lifetime, and will live far beyond mine\".\n\nShareholders \"don't have too long to wait\" before his chosen successors step up, Buffett remarked at one point during the meeting. \"Generally, I feel fine,\" he added hastily, \"but I know a little bit about actuarial tables,\" conceding he \"shouldn't be taking on any four-year employment contracts\".\n\nGreg Abel, his chosen successor, was at his side on Saturday. \"One way or another, there are more than 24 hours in his day,\" Buffett told investors. \"This place, if anything happened to me, it would be working extremely well the next day.\"\n\nThe prospect of Berkshire without Buffett tomorrow has, nevertheless, layered an air of apprehension across Omaha today.\n\nThe firm's shareholders diligently travel hundreds, if not, thousands, of miles to hear from the so-called sage of Omaha. Some 93% of the city's hotel rooms are said to be booked out before each meeting, setting up one of the busiest weekends of the year for its businesses.\n\nWhether Berkshire's new guard will have the same star power, and pull such vast crowds - without the card-carrying capitalist icons who built it - is a worry for locals.\n\n\"The company is all about Buffett,\" said Colin Duggan, who owns and runs Kitchen Table, a downtown cafe, with his wife, Jessica. \"If Buffett's not around? Yeah, we're nervous. We're a little nervous about it, for sure.\"\n\nBuffett relocated Berkshire from New England to his hometown back in 1970, a few years after taking control. The company, and its chief executive, have stayed put ever since - and become omnipresent throughout the city.\n\nOver the years, residents have spotted the tycoon (currently the world's ninth-richest person, according to Bloomberg, with a personal fortune of $132bn) playing ping-pong with Bill Gates, eating ice cream with Paul McCartney and having dinner with LeBron James - unlikely scenes in a city that sits not on the \"elitist\" coasts, but at the heart of America's Great Plains region.\n\nDespite his extraordinary wealth, Buffett still famously lives in the five-bedroom house he bought for $31,500 in 1958. \"It's not a flashy neighborhood, by any means. It's not a flashy house,\" laughed Colin Duggan, 45, who grew up in the area. \"It was really, really strange to see all these tourists, with cameras, taking pictures.\"\n\nThe mix of mega-wealth and modesty has proven magnetic each spring. Back in 2022, shortly after opening Godega Market, a corner store and cafe, owners David Kerr, 35, and his partner, Nate Flick, 34, were still working the counter when they heard the impact of Berkshire's annual meeting.\n\nStanding by the coffee machine, \"every third or fourth\" accent in the line prompted Kerr, 34, to ask where customers were from. The answers varied from Australia to Brazil. \"It was very refreshing,\" he said.\n\nA short walk away, Kitchen Table was also humming this weekend. Jessica Duggan, 44, estimated that Sunday - the day after Berkshire shareholders fill up Omaha's 18,975-seat CHI arena - was typically the cafe's biggest of the year. The whole weekend is \"really huge for us,\" added Colin.\n\n\"You can talk with probably any business, any restaurant, any hotel during this period,\" said Deborah Ward, executive director of Visit Omaha, its tourism agency. \"Berkshire Hathaway makes an impact every year.\"\n\nFor all that the firm has given Omaha, Buffett claims, it has also been rewarded. Both its architects were born there, and the executives tapped to lead it forward - Abel, 61, who already oversees Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, and Ajit Jain, its vice chairman of insurance operations, 72 - previously lived in the city.\n\n\"So what is going on? Is it Omaha's water? Is it Omaha's air?\" Buffett wondered in his annual letter. \"Is it some strange planetary phenomenon akin to that which has produced Jamaica's sprinters, Kenya's marathon runners, or Russia's chess experts?\"\n\n\"Keep an open mind. Come to Omaha in May, inhale the air, drink the water,\" he wrote, urging investors to introduce themselves to his sister, Bertie, \"and her good-looking daughters\".\n\nWhether to hear from Buffett or meet Bertie's daughters, people came.\n\nRamya and Shiva Amrit flew from Bellevue, Washington. Both have followed Berkshire since high school. While Ramya agrees that it's \"not going to be the same\" without Buffett, he and his wife plan to keep coming. Abel is \"a close second\", he said, \"so I'll still be here.\"\n\nMany shareholders arrive a day early for a discount shopping day. \"This is really, really, really busy,\" said Priscilla Cardenas, 59, who first bought shares 15 years ago, and turned up hours before doors opened to find bargains at Fruit of the Loom, Berkshire's clothing retailer.\n\n\"People love to see Warren,\" said Nancy, 62, who traveled from Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n\"Keeping the dream alive - the financial dream,\" added her friend Lisa, 60. \"Money's not taboo for him. Being extra wealthy is not taboo.\"\n\nMichael Graham, 22, drove 14 hours from Youngstown, Ohio, with his dad, also Michael, 59. Buffett \"just has that way about him\", he said. \"Whenever he talks, you just want to listen.\"\n\nThe legacy of Omaha's so-called oracle will endure, according to Graham. \"I feel like the base he's built, it's hard to mess it up,\" he said. But will investors still turn up in droves once Abel, Buffett's publicity-shy heir apparent, is running the show?\n\n\"That's a good question.\"\n\n\"Omaha and Berkshire Hathaway have this thing. It almost defies explanation,\" said Ward, of Visit Omaha, who is \"hopefully confident\" the firm will stay in her city for years to come.\n\nKerr, at Godega Market, also expressed hope that \"whenever Warren Buffet passes the CEO baton\" that Berkshire \"will always consider\" Omaha its home - and that its shareholders keep coming \"year after year\".\n\n\"It is off the beaten path, I think that's fair to say,\" he said. \"It's not your typical tourist town. But that's also refreshing. I'm sure there's many people from different countries that wouldn't just throw a dart and go to Omaha, Nebraska, but maybe are pleasantly surprised when they arrive.\"\n\nThanking investors for coming, Buffett alluded once more to the question on so many of his shareholders' minds. \"I not only hope you come next year, but I hope I come next year,\" he chuckled. His disciples took to their feet and applauded. \"I'll see you next year,\" he said.\n\nUnder new management, Berkshire might continue to thrive. Profits within its insurance, railroad and peanut-brittle businesses could surge; its $336bn investment portfolio, with stakes in companies from Apple to Chevron, might swell; its stock may well scale fresh heights.\n\nBut this firm was built around a fanbase: not just shareholders, but a unique, dedicated community of followers, who travel far and wide to catch the big show, buy the merch, and jostle to get close to the stage.\n\nWhile a fervent and vocal generation has emerged in recent years, it materialized online. Young retail investors, to Buffett's dismay, mobilized on social media to coalesce around a string of \"meme stocks\" like GameStop and AMC. Day-trading the hottest new fad on Robinhood could not be much further from his ardent belief in the power of long-term investment.\n\nThe challenge facing Buffett's successors will not just be to shore up profits, but to preserve the passion of Berkshire's true believers: those still prepared to put their faith in a conglomerate, rather than Reddit tips.\n\nIn years to come, on the morning of the firm's annual meeting, those in charge could do worse than wander Omaha's streets, and count how many investors remain willing to line up before sunrise for the best seats in the house.",

The move seemed inevitable after parent Walt Disney Co. earlier this year appointed another executive, Debra O'Connell, to oversee the division. Announcing the move on Sunday, O'Connell says she'll be in charge at ABC News \"for the time being.\" Godwin was an outsider, appointed president of ABC News, after working most recently at CBS News. ABC's flagship programs, \"World News Tonight\" and \"Good Morning America,\" remain atop the network rankings, although the morning show has seen some slippage lately.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway event gives good view of Warren Buffett's successor but also raises new questions\n\nThis year's Berkshire Hathaway meeting gave shareholders their best chance yet to hear from the man who will one day take over as CEO when Warren Buffett is gone. Buffett said for the first time Saturday that Greg Abel should also take responsibility for the company's investments after he takes over, raising new questions about the succession plan. Abel put his encyclopedic knowledge of the utility business that he led directly for years on display and delved into railroad operations and potential acquisitions that Berkshire pursued while sharing the stage with Buffett all day. For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp. Observers said even if Abel is going at evaluating businesses, stock picking isn't easy.\n\nLawsuit against Meta asks if Facebook users have right to control their feeds using external tools\n\nDo social media users have the right to control what they see -- or don't see -- on their feeds? A lawsuit filed against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is arguing that a federal law often used to shield internet companies from liability also allows people to use external tools to take control of their feed -- even if that means shutting it off entirely. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Meta Platforms on behalf of an Amherst professor who wants to release a tool to let users unfollow all the content fed to them by Facebook's algorithm.\n\nWarren Buffett says AI may be better for scammers than society. And he's seen how\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett has come face to face with the downside of AI. And it looks just like him. The billionaire investing guru told tens of thousands of shareholders at his annual conference in Omaha that he recently saw an AI video of himself, complete with a perfect voiceover, giving fake advice. It was so convincing, he says, he can see how people would fall for the scam. Buffett spent all day Saturday answering shareholder questions at his first annual meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died. The absence offered shareholders the chance to hear more from the next generation of leaders who will take over after Buffett is gone.\n\nBerkshire's profit plunges 64% on portfolio holdings as Buffett sells Apple\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway says its first quarter profit plummeted on the paper value of its investments. At the same time, the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright did well. A few hours before shareholders got the chance to hear from CEO Warren Buffett at the annual meeting in Omaha, Berkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down roughly one-third from a year ago. The biggest news is that Berkshire sold off about 13% of its massive Apple stake, though the iphone maker remains Berkshire's biggest single investment and Buffett says he plans to keep it.\n\nBoeing locks out its private firefighters around Seattle over pay dispute\n\nBoeing has locked out its private force of firefighters who protect its aircraft-manufacturing plants in the Seattle area and brought in replacements after the latest round of negotiations with the firefighters' union failed to deliver an agreement on wages. The company said Saturday that it locked out about 125 firefighters and a facility about 170 miles away in central Washington. The firefighters serve as first responders to fires and medical emergencies and can call in help from local departments. Boeing says its firefighters were paid $91,000 on average last year. The International Association of Fire Fighters says they are paid far less than crews at local fire departments in the Seattle area.\n\nWarren Buffett's company rejects proposals, but it faces lawsuit over how it handled one last year\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Shareholder proposals are usually uneventful at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, but Warren Buffett and the company are now facing a lawsuit over the way one presenter was treated last year. Peter Flaherty with the National Legal and Policy Center came back with another proposal this year asking Berkshire to produce a report on the risk of doing business in China after he was cut off in the middle of his presentation last year and arrested for trespassing. The charges were later dropped, but Flaherty decided to sue. He said he had never had trouble at dozens of meetings he has presented at since 2005, including Berkshire's 2022 meeting. Flaherty's proposal was one of six rejected Saturday after Berkshire and Buffett opposed them all.\n\nUS employers scaled back hiring in April. How that could let the Fed cut interest rates\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's employers pulled back on their hiring in April but still added a decent 175,000 jobs in a sign that persistently high interest rates may be starting to slow the robust U.S. job market. Last month's hiring gain was down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March. Yet the moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown last month in wage growth, will likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates at a two-decade high to fight persistently elevated inflation. Hourly wages rose a less-than-expected 0.2% from March and 3.9% from a year earlier, the smallest annual gain since June 2021.\n\nStock market today: Wall Street rallies after hiring shows welcome signs of cooling\n\nStocks closed sharply higher on Wall Street, erasing their losses for the week, after the government reported a cooldown in hiring last month. For markets that was a welcome sign that the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight inflation by slowing the economy with high interest rates might be making some progress. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% Friday, its biggest gain since February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2%. U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month, down sharply from a big increase in March. Apple jumped after announcing a mammoth $110 billion stock buyback.\n\nGoogle, Justice Department make final arguments about whether search engine is a monopoly\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and Google are making their closing arguments in a high-stakes antitrust trial to a federal judge in Washington who must now decide whether the tech giant's search engine constitutes an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department argued Friday that Google's preeminence as an internet search engine is an illegal monopoly propped up by more than $20 billion spent each year by the tech giant to lock out competition. Google argues that its ubiquity flows from its superior product and its ability to deliver consumers the results that it's looking for. A final ruling in the case is expected later this year.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com",

The reason, of course, was to attend the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, or what is often referred to as \"Woodstock for capitalists.\"\n\nPart of the experience for attendees is to get an update from the 93-year-old Berkshire founder and CEO Warren Buffett on his holding company's overall performance and outlook for its component businesses, both publicly traded and privately held ones.\n\nOn that score, Buffett informed his shareholders that first-quarter operating earnings came in at $11.2 billion, versus $8.07 billion for the same period a year earlier. The so-called \"Oracle of Omaha\" also revealed that the firm's cash stockpile rose to $189 billion at the end of the first quarter, a new all-time record. Buffett added that \"it's a fair assumption\" that its cash hoard will hit $200 billion at end of this quarter.\n\nAll that cash is not burning a hole in his pocket, however. Buffett told attendees that he would \"love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money.\" Instead of going on a shopping spree for other companies, Berkshire bought back about $2.6 billion of its own shares in the first quarter.\n\nBerkshire's decision to sell some shares of its Apple holdings was the other big news from this portion of the day's proceedings. The company reported a $135.4 billion stake at the end of March, down from $174.3 billion at the end of the year.\n\nElsewhere in the portfolio, earnings at Berkshire's insurance businesses rose $2.6 billion, versus $911 million in the same period last year, primarily thanks to superior results at Geico. And it's railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3 percent decline in earnings from the prior period as a result of \"unfavorable changes in business mix.\"\n\nShares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway have returned 11 percent year-to-date, compared with a 9 percent rise for the S&P 500. Over the past 5 years, Buffett's holding company is up 92 percent compared with the S&P 500's 79 percent return. Go back even further, and Buffett's baby really blows away the benchmark index.\n\nWEIGHING THE ORACLE'S ADVICE\n\nOnce the Berkshire corporate housekeeping is completed, Buffett spends the rest of the day answering questions from the crowd about his views on the market, economy and a host of other topics. Sadly, he had to do it somewhat solo this year due to the passing of Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman and Buffett's long-time investing partner, who died at 99 in late November.\n\nStill, he soldiered on, offering his wit and wisdom to the attendees and various media sources covering the event.\n\nYet while Buffett continues to captivate his own crowd after all these years, his words seem to reverberate less on Wall Street than they once did. No longer do fund managers or financial advisors hang on his every word or freeze and listen like they did in those old EF Hutton commercials.\n\n\"I'd say we follow his actions more than his words,\" said Eric Amzalag, owner of Peak Financial Planning.\n\nAmzalag says he generally does not factor what Warren Buffett has to say into his investing framework, despite owning Berkshire shares in client portfolios. And as to which market voice Amzalag listens to most regularly when it comes to portfolio management strategy, he points to Lance Roberts from Real Investment Advisors.\n\n\"Lance combines fundamentals and technicals in his approach to client money management,\" said Amzalag. \"I have found his perspective to be an excellent resource that provides calmness and clarity to me and my clients.\"\n\nFor David Demming, founder of Demming Financial, Buffett's appeal is more about his value philosophy than his cult of personality. Demming has been a strong proponent of value investing for more than forty years and utilizes value funds, notably First Eagle Funds, as cornerstones of his client portfolios.\n\n\"Classic value is our mantra but even Buffett has shown flexibility in example buying Apple,\" said Demming. \"The message is to be selective, flexible and patient rather than ideologically pure.\"\n\nAs a \"modern\" value investor, Christopher Davis, partner at Hudson Value Partners, says Warren Buffett continues to loom large over his work, no matter how long he's been at it.\n\n\"We follow Berkshire's 13Fs with interest, but it is the method he has refined over 70 years, and the lens with which he views businesses that has helped to shape Hudson Value Partners,\" said Davis. \"As a boutique firm, we enjoy a lot more flexibility as an investor than the $860b+ conglomerate and can draw just as much inspiration from the early days of the Buffett Partnership and Berkshire as we do the evolved focus on excellent businesses at fair prices.\"\n\nMatthew Liebman, CEO of Amplius Wealth Advisors, says he has been greatly influenced by Warren Buffett over the years including the power of investment discipline and maintaining a long-term focus.\n\nHis favorite Buffett quote: \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\"\n\nSpeaking of Wall Street aphorisms, Ted Brooks, partner at Nordwand Capital, says he's always been fond of Charlie Munger's \"buying wonderful businesses at fair prices\" saying.\n\n\"I am a value investor at heart and very much agree with the idea of buying companies for the long-term based on the underlying execution, management, and business positioning of that company, rather than seeing myself as a short-term stock trader/investor,\" said Brooks. \"In that way, I suppose I owe much of my outlook to the extended Ben Graham value tree.\"\n\nOutside the Oracle of Omaha, Brooks also follows hedge fund titan Stan Druckenmiller.\n\n\"He's prescient and has had a succinct way of making lucid and logical points about markets and macro that appeals to me,\" said Brooks.\n\nFinally, while he loves a great Warren Buffett investing quote, Nathan Hoyt, chief investment officer at Regent Peak Wealth Advisors, says Buffett's portfolio maneuvers should have no bearing on how he or any advisor manage their client assets.\n\n\"Buffett's ability to communicate investment ideas into short and relatable sound bites is second to none, but no investor should behave in a way to build or protect wealth based on what any billionaire is doing or saying,\" said Hoyt. \"If your goal is to grow wealth, following the Oracle of Omaha into a large cash position might feel brilliant, but it doesn't align with the goal.\"", "source": {"uri":

But they're not worried about their investments.\n\n\"The crowds will be smaller when Buffett isn't here, but the company will still do well,\" said Jason Garner, a 20-year-old student from Queens University in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nBerkshire is an $865 billion conglomerate whose dozens of companies include Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, many utilities, industrial businesses, and the maker of Ginsu knives.\n\nBuffett has run it from his hometown of Omaha since 1965. Despite Berkshire's size, its shares outgained the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last decade, though by less than they once did.\n\nMany who attended the weekend Buffett dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" expressed confidence, sometimes tinged with unease, about Berkshire's future without the legendary billionaire.\n\nThe death in November of Buffett's longtime business partner Charlie Munger at age 99 renewed focus on Buffett's own age.\n\nBuffett navigated almost five hours of shareholder questions in a downtown arena with his successor-in-waiting Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 61.\n\nIn an adjacent exhibit hall featuring Berkshire companies, shareholders scooped up spatulas, jewelry, Squishmallows toys and several tons of See's Candies. Many posed for photos with the Geico gecko.\n\nA large number of shareholders came from across the globe.\n\n\"Warren said Berkshire is built to last,\" said Mike Lin, a financial analyst from Guangzhou, China, who with his sister bought Benjamin Moore teddy bears.\n\nLygia Bulle, a financial planner from Curitiba, Brazil, took her 17- and 19-year-old sons to the meeting.\n\n\"Warren Buffett is the greatest investor in the world,\" she said. \"Going to see him in person has a different impact from seeing him at home.\"\n\nBRAVING THE RAIN\n\nAs usual, thousands of shareholders lined up in the overnight hours Saturday to hear Buffett, despite rain and wind that shortened the lines. Some said people were waiting 12 hours before the arena's 7 a.m. opening.\n\nBuffett's fame, wisdom and magnetism are a big part of the draw. Abel won't command the same affection from shareholders though leaders of Berkshire's businesses say they regard him highly.\n\nNo one knows if the weekend will stay the same without Buffett. Omaha hopes so: no annual event other than baseball's College World Series matters more to its economy.\n\n\"Yes, I will be back if Warren Buffett isn't here because I will wonder about Berkshire Hathaway's future,\" said Gyuhwan Kim, 26, a software engineer from South Korea who got in line at 3:30 a.m. \"But no, I will not come this early. Once is enough.\"\n\nJordan Kaneshiro, a Honolulu native now working as a nurse in Omaha, said: \"It's just one of the things you have got to do. You buy shares of a company and you want to see what the company is up to.\"\n\nThat approach would survive Buffett's exit.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that time will come, perhaps soon, breaking out in laughter after telling shareholders: \"I not only hope that you come next year, I hope I come next year.\"\n\nRichard Callahan, a BMO banker from Omaha, said Buffett has become less visible locally.\n\n\"You just don't see him,\" he said. \"I live and work in the same neighborhood. You don't see him out in his car as much, and once in a while you'll see him with a driver.\"\n\nBut the 57-year-old still marvels at Buffett. \"93?\" he said. \"I can only hope that I'm functioning as he is.\"\n\n(Reporting by Koh Gui Qing and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha; Editing by Diane Craft)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc posted a record quarterly profit on Saturday, boosted by strength in its insurance operations, and appears to have sold a significant number of Apple shares as its cash stake swelled to $189 billion.\n\nThe size of Berkshire's stake in Apple stake fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, even though the iPhone maker's share price fell just 11% in the quarter.\n\nA large sale would be an about-face for Buffett, who has long touted the iPhone maker's leadership and market dominance. Some investors have expressed concern that Apple had become too large a part of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nFirst-quarter operating profit rose 39% to $11.22 billion, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.\n\nNet income fell 64% to $12.7 billion, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5 billion.\n\nAn accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains from its common stock holdings. Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.\n\nBerkshire also repurchased $2.6 billion of its own stock.

That's about four times bigger than Berkshire's second-biggest public stock holding, Bank of America, and makes the company the No. 2 Apple shareholder, behind only Vanguard.\n\nAs Berkshire investors and fanboys of the 93-year-old Buffett flood Omaha this weekend for the 2024 annual meeting, Apple is likely to be a hot topic of discussion. The tech giant on Thursday reported a 10% year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, leading to a 4% drop in total revenue. But the stock had its best day since late 2022 on Friday due largely to a $110 billion stock buyback plan and increased margins that result from a growing services business.\n\nThe bet on Apple and CEO Tim Cook has paid off handsomely for Buffett, who said in 2022 that the cost of Berkshire's Apple stake was only $31 billion. His firm is up almost 620% on its investment since the start of 2016.\n\nDespite being a self-described Luddite, Buffett has long had a coherent non-techie thesis for loving Apple. He's seen how devoted Apple users are to their devices, and has viewed the iPhone as an extraordinary product that could keep its customers spending inside the Apple ecosystem. He calls it a moat, one of his favorite words for describing his preferred businesses.\n\n\"Apple has a position with consumers that they're paying $1,500 or whatever it may be for a phone, and these same people pay $35,000 for a second car,\" Buffett said at last year's meeting. \"And if they had to give up their second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car!\"\n\nData is in his favor. According to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Apple benefits from 94% customer loyalty, meaning that nine out of 10 current U.S. iPhone owners choose another iPhone when buying a new device.\n\nBuffett also has hailed Apple's ability to return billions of dollars to shareholders annually through share buybacks and dividends, a capital allocation strategy for which the billionaire investor may have himself to thank. When the Apple CEO was asked in a 2016 interview with The Washington Post who he turns to for advice at pivotal moments, Cook offered up a story about his relationship with Buffett.\n\n\"When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias?\" Cook said. \"So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he's the natural person.\"\n\nMore from Berkshire Hathaway's Annual Meeting\n\nApple has shown its appreciation for the Oracle of Omaha in other ways.\n\nIn 2019, the company published an original iPhone game called \"Warren Buffett's Paper Wizard\" in which a paperboy bikes from Omaha to Apple's hometown of Cupertino, California.\n\nBut with Apple's business having declined in size in five of the past six quarters and with the company expecting just low single-digit growth in the current quarter, Buffett may face questions this weekend at the shareholder meeting about whether he still sees the same power in the moat, particularly with regulatory pressures building around tech's mega-cap companies.\n\nBuffett trimmed his stake in Apple late last year, though only by about 1%. Even after Friday's rally, the stock is down 3.8% in 2024, while the S&P 500 is up 7.5%.\n\n'Very, very, very locked in'\n\nBerkshire's initial foray into Apple in 2016 was not Buffett's idea. Rather, the investment was led by Ted Weschler, one of his top deputies, and was seen as a passing of the torch to the next generation of Berkshire investment managers.\n\nBut the following year, Berkshire started purchasing even more Apple shares, and Buffett began talking it up. He said he liked the stock and the company's \"sticky\" product, although he didn't use it.\n\nIn 2018, he said Apple users are \"very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally\" to the product and the ecosystem.\n\n\"Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise,\" he said.\n\nAt last year's annual meeting, when asked how Berkshire can defend having Apple make up so much of its public portfolio, Buffett said, \"It just happens to be a better business than any we own.\" He also hailed Cook, calling him one of the \"best managers in the world.\"\n\nA number Apple likes to use to tout the health of its business, despite the declining revenue, is \"2.2 billion.\" That's how many devices the company says are currently in use and points to the massive customer base available as Apple rolls out new subscription services.\n\n\"Once customers get into the ecosystem, they don't leave. So it's not a speculative tech play,\" said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Apple shares. \"It's kind of more like an annuity and I think that's what Warren Buffett really sees as well.\"\n\nIn addition to the drop in revenue, Apple faces new challenges from regulations and weak overseas markets, as well as from Microsoft and Google's advancements in artificial intelligence. For regulators, the concern surrounds the very moat that Buffett finds so attractive, and whether it gives the company monopolistic control in the smartphone market.\n\nThe U.S. government in March alleged that Apple designs its business to keep customers locked in. The Department of Justice's lawsuit claimed that products like Apple Card, the Apple Arcade game subscription, iMessage and Apple Watch work best or only with an iPhone, creating illegal barriers to competition and making it harder for consumers to switch when it's time for an upgrade.\n\nHowever, the litigation is expected to take years, pushing any potential penalties to Apple and its products well into the future. In the meantime, there's no sign that the iPhone is becoming less important as new devices like virtual reality goggles have found only niche audiences, while consumer AI products have failed to take off.\n\nBuffett hasn't voiced his view publicly on Apple's regulatory hurdles, and this will be the first opportunity for investors to ask him about the issue since the DOJ's lawsuit. But Buffett knows a little something about regulation -- two markets where he's most active are railroads and insurance.\n\nIn a note to clients earlier this month, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi didn't go deep on regulatory concerns, but mentioned that he doesn't believe the DOJ suit will \"seriously threaten\" the strength of Apple's ecosystem. He also said that following Buffett's lead on getting in and out of Apple is a solid strategy for making money.\n\n\"Despite his reputation as a long term buy and hold investor, Warren Buffett has been remarkably disciplined at adding to his Apple position when it is relatively cheap and trimming when it is relatively expensive,\" Sacconaghi wrote. He encouraged investors to \"be like Buffett.\"\n\nMore money back\n\nOdds are that Buffett was thrilled with Apple's announcement this week regarding its expanded repurchase program. It's a practice he's long adored.\n\n\"When I buy Apple, I know that Apple is going to repurchase a lot of shares,\" he said in 2018.\n\nAnd he likes to note how buybacks result in getting a bigger stake in the company without buying more shares.\n\n\"The math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time,\" Buffett said in 2021.\n\nApple also increased its dividend by 4%, and signaled that it would continue to lift it annually.\n\nBuffett was effusive about the tech giant's capital-return strategy at the conglomerate's annual meeting last year, pointing out that it helped Berkshire own a bigger piece of the pie. Unlike insurance company Geico and homebuilder Clayton Homes, which his firm owns in their entirety, Berkshire can continue to increase its stake in Apple, a fact he reminded investors of at the meeting.\n\n\"The good thing about Apple is that we can go up,\" Buffett said.\n\nDon't miss these exclusives from CNBC PRO\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType":

For the first time, the 2024 meeting was chaired by the Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett without his trusted business partner and friend late Charlie Munger beside him. With the billionaire investor turning 94 this year and Munger's death last November, the succession plan at Berkshire was decidedly the most talked about subject ahead of the AGM. That apart Buffett shared some interesting perspectives on AI scamming and explained why Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple.\n\nTaking questions from shareholders for the first time since Munger's passing away, Buffett paid rich tribute to his late friend and partner and called him the \"architect\" of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBerkshire succession plan: Greg Abel to take investing decisions\n\nBuffett had earlier named his successor in Greg Abel way back in 2021 but the exact contours of this plan had increasingly become a key concern for shareholders. The Oracle of Omaha clearly said that Abel, who is currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations will be taking over as the CEO eventually and will be taking decisions with respect to investments. \"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg. The responsibility has been with me, and I farmed out some of it, and I used to think differently about how that would be handled, but I think the responsibility should be that of the CEO.\"\n\nWhy did Berkshire reduce its stake in Apple\n\nDuring the course of the Q&A, Buffett answered several questions with regards to some of the key investment decisions taken by Berkshire Hathway lately. Decidedly reducing stake in Apple was one of the key topics. Buffett clarified that it had nothing to do with the long-term view on the stock and Apple will probably remain one of their largest holdings despite the recent slowdown. The stake was reduced mostly on account of tax considerations as a result of the gains on its investment, \"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check -- and I would really hope with all that America's done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it -- and if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\" Buffett was indicating towards his views on tax rates that he expects going up to support the widening of the U.S. fiscal deficit.\n\nPraise for Powell\n\nEven as the US is battling a ballooning fiscal deficit, Warren Buffett praised Federal Reserve's Jerome Powell for his efforts in managing the economy. Buffett called Powell a \"very wise man.\" According to him, Powell \"doesn't control fiscal policy, and every now and then he sends out a disguised plea ... because that's where the trouble will be, if we have it.\"\n\nWhy AI scamming is like a 'genie out of the bottle'\n\nWarren Buffett drew similarities between nuclear weapons and AI technology and felt it has the possibility to bring about great changes. Calling it a \"genie out of the bottle\" he believes artificial intelligence scamming could be the next big \"growth industry.\" \"When you think about the potential for scamming people, if you can reproduce images that I can't even tell, that say, 'I need money,' as your daughter, 'I just had a car crash, I need $50,000 wired.' I mean, scamming has always been part of the American scene, but this would make me, if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going to be the growth industry of all time,\" he explained. \"And I don't know any way to get the genie back in the bottle, and AI is somewhat similar,\" he added.\n\nNot uncomfortable with putting money in Canada\n\nBuffett did not share the exact details of his investment plans but said that Berkshire Hathaway was uncomfortable about putting money in any way in Canada, \"We do not feel uncomfortable in any way shape or form putting our money into Canada. In fact, we're actually looking at one thing now.\"\n\nEmotional and standing ovation for Munger\n\nIn a bid to encapsulate Munger's contribution, Buffett paid a movie tribute to his friend and business partner. At the end of the movie, nearly 30,000 shareholders gave a standing ovation to Munger, paying respect to his memory.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha concluded the event on Saturday with a rather cheeky comment that aptly highlighted the uncertainty of our lives, \"Not only do I hope you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\"", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sumana_sarkar@financialexpress.com", "name": "Sumana Sarkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government budget balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Godrej-2024-05-05T135620.738.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It marked the 60th meeting Buffett has held since he took over the company in 1965, and the billionaire was energetic in his responses despite having handed off many responsibilities to Abel and Jain.\n\n\"I don't really do much, and I don't operate at the same level of efficiency that I would have 30 or 40 years ago,\" Buffett said. \"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me? It has worked out extremely well.\n\n\"The number of calls I get from managers is essentially awfully close to zero, and Greg is handling those. I don't know quite how he does it, but we've got the right person, I can tell you that,\" he added. Buffett said he feels \"fine\" but joked he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nBUFFETT EXPLAINS BERKSHIRE'S REDUCED STAKE IN APPLE AT ANNUAL COMPANY MEETING\n\nIn reference to Berkshire Hathaway's future capital allocation decisions, Buffett said, \"If I were on that board and making that decision, I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg. He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses you understand common stocks.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nAbel, who was designated to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire CEO in 2021, said, \"As we go through any transition, it's important to know that the capital allocation principles that Berkshire lives by today will continue to survive Warren.\"\n\nJain also weighed in and noted that he, as head of Berkshire's insurance business, isn't irreplaceable and that Apple CEO Tim Cook's succession of Steve Jobs showed that no executive - even those as iconic as Buffett or Jobs - is irreplaceable.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT BLASTS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ANNUAL LETTER\n\nBuffett also paid tribute to the late Charlie Munger, who died in November at the age of 99, hailing him as the \"architect of today's Berkshire.\"\n\n\"The architect is the person who dreams of and designs and finally supervises the construction of great structures. The carpenters and the beavers -- that's me -- are needed, but the architect is the genius of Berkshire,\" Buffett said. He added that Munger's design \"lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nThe company kicked off the meeting with a tribute video of the two friends who first met in 1959 and spent decades working together. It also sold copies of Munger's book, \"Poor Charlie's Almanack,\" a collection of Munger's wit and wisdom, at the convention.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT PAYS TRIBUTE TO FRIEND, CHARLIE MUNGER AS 'ARCHITECT' OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY\n\n\"Charlie, in all the years we worked together, not only never once lied to me, ever, but he didn't even shape things so that he told half lies or quarter lies to sort of stack the deck in the direction he wanted to go,\" Buffett said.\n\nGiven the prominence of succession and tributes to Munger's legacy at the first annual meeting since his friend's death, Buffett also spoke broadly about his outlook on life.\n\n\"You don't know where the paths of life go. You can't beat yourself up. You try and do the things important to you. I enjoy managing money for the people who trust me. I like the feeling of being trusted. I am not looking to change much. I believe in trying to find what you're good at and what you enjoy. I think the one thing you can aspire to be is be kind,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"Thank you very, very much for coming, and I not only hope that you come next year. But I hope that I come next year,\" Buffett joked to the packed arena at the end of the question-and-answer session.\n\nOriginal article source: Buffett talks succession plan, pays tribute to Munger at annual meeting", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The conglomerate's operating earnings, or the profits generated directly by the businesses that it owns, rose 39%, from $8.065 billion in the first quarter of 2023 to $11.2 billion this year. Buffett has long argued operating profits are a more valuable metric than net profits. Berkshire benefited from a strong performance from its insurance businesses, which include Geico, and its operating earnings from insurance underwriting rose to $2.6 billion from $911 million last year.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha is a hotly anticipated financial event each year, with investors eagerly awaiting to hear Buffett's advice and predictions on finances and the economy. It's often referred to as \"Woodstock for capitalists.\" But this year's event took on a different tenor, as it was the first time Buffett took the stage to speak with shareholders without Charlie Munger, his longtime friend and business partner who died last year.\n\nThis year's event was filled with tributes to Munger, including a video featuring Munger's and Buffett's many interviews and pop culture appearances -- like on the sitcom \"the Office.\" While answering questions from investors, Buffett turned to Abel and mistakenly called him \"Charlie,\" drawing laughter and cheer from the crowd. \"I'd actually checked myself a couple times already,\" Buffett said. \"I'll slip again.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breaking news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GEICO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woodstock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munger", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6636816a563394edbb0c3499/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2237,1258,x0,y40,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

That would indicate, taking Apple's share prices at the end of each period into account, that Berkshire cut its holdings in Apple stock by about 116 million shares, or nearly 13%, during the first quarter.\n\nThough Apple remains by far Berkshire's largest stock holding, the latest reduction is far greater than the 10 million-share cut disclosed for the fourth quarter. Berkshire is also Apple's single largest shareholder.\n\nAsked at the company's annual shareholder meeting whether his views about the economics of Apple's business or its attractiveness as an investment had changed, Buffett said they hadn't but acknowledged that Berkshire had sold shares.\n\nBuffett said that American Express (AXP) and Coca Cola (KO), two of Berkshire's other large stock holdings, are wonderful businesses, and that Apple \"is an even better business,\" noting that it's \"extremely likely\" that Apple will remain Berkshire's largest stock holding at the end of 2024.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Apple accounted for 50% of Berkshire's shareholdings, as the chart below shows. Berkshire first acquired Apple stock in 2016.\n\n\"We will end up -- unless something dramatically happens that really changes capital allocation strategy -- we will have Apple as our largest investment, but I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position,\" the Berkshire chief executive told the tens of thousands of shareholders gathered in Omaha\n\n\"I think, when I look at the alternative of what's available in equity markets and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,\" Buffett added.\n\nBerkshire said in its quarterly report that its insurance and other businesses held $182.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills at the end of the first quarter, up 12% from $163.3 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nBuffett said it's \"a fair assumption\" that the number will rise to about $200 billion at the end of the second quarter.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" he said.\n\nCNBC reported that Buffett and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had spoken at length on Friday and that Cook was aware that the disclosure of the reduced stake was coming today.\n\nCNBC's Becky Quick said she had spoken with Cook, who noted that Berkshire remains Apple's largest shareholder and that Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, which he said he feels good about and that it's a privilege to have Berkshire as a shareholder.\n\nAfter gaining nearly 50% in 2023, Apple shares fell 11% in the first quarter as investors worried about the company's sluggish growth and declining sales in China. That decline stood in sharp contrast with the 10% increase for the S&P 500 in the quarter, as well as gains for other tech giants such as Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nApple shares surged 6% on Friday, a day after the company announced better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal second quarter, driven by the strong performance of its Services business, as well as iPhone and China sales numbers that weren't as bad as feared. The company also announced a $110 billion stock buyback program, the biggest in U.S. corporate history.\n\nInvestors are now turning their attention to some key events -- such as Tuesday's launch of new iPad models and the company's annual developers conference in June -- for indications of what will drive the next phase of growth for Apple. They're also keen for the company to unveil details about initiatives tied to artificial intelligence, an area that Cook says is \"a very key opportunity\" but in which the company is seen as lagging its big tech peers.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/0Ew6oJtlMpTw8PhV8KhWDUZtPbI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-13946501421-8dbc5799733c44daaa3ac8bdb8f18fec.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Buffett pointed to the technology's ability to reproduce realistic and almost misleading content in an attempt to send money to bad actors.\n\nHe told the audience of the meeting that he could have been misled into sending money online to a person who claimed to Warren Buffett.\n\n\"Obviously, AI has potential for good things too, but ... I do think, as someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm -- and I just don't know how that plays out,\" Buffett added.\n\nOn Berkshire's future:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway won't make a lot of investments outside the United States, Buffett noted.\n\n\"We made the commitment in Japan ... five years ago and that was just ... extraordinarily compelling ... but you won't find us making a lot of investments outside the United States,\" the billionaire investing guru told the tens of thousands of shareholders of his investment company.\n\nHe made the comments in response to a question from a Hong Kong shareholder during the meeting.\n\n\"I understand the United States rules, weaknesses, strengths ... I don't have the same feeling for economies around the world, I don't pick up on other cultures extremely well,\" Buffett acknowledged.\n\n\"We will be American oriented. If we do something really big, it's extremely likely it will be in the United States,\" he said.\n\n\"The goal of Berkshire ... is to increase the operating earnings and decrease the shares outstanding. It's that simple to describe, it's not quite so simple to pull off necessarily, but that's what we're attempting to do,\" the legendary investor added.\n\nOn Charlie Munger:\n\nMunger was the \"architect of today's Berkshire. The architect is the person who dreams of and designs, and finally supervises the construction of great structures. The carpenters and the beavers, that's me, are needed, but the architect is the genius of Berkshire.\"\n\n\"Charlie, in all the years we worked together, not only never once lied to me, ever, but he didn't even shape things so that he told half lies or quarter lies to sort of stack the deck in the direction he wanted to go.\"\n\nOn succession:\n\n\"I don't really do much and I don't operate at the same level of efficiency that I would have thirty years ago or forty years ago ... when you've got somebody like Greg [Abel] and Ajit [Jain], why settle for me? It has worked out extremely well.\"\n\n\"The number of calls I get from managers is essentially awfully close to zero and Greg is handling those. I don't know quite how he does it, but we've got the right person, I can tell you that.\"\n\n\"We will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place.\"\n\nOn Apple:\n\n\"We own American Express which is a wonderful business, we own Coca Cola which is a wonderful business, and we own Apple which is an even better business.\"\n\n\"Unless something really extraordinary happens we will own Apple, American Express and Coca Cola.\"\n\n\"At the end of the year I would say it's extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have.\"", "source": {"uri": "tmtpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tmtpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Architect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munger", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munger"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.tmtpost.com/uploads/images/zhaopian/nuxtpic/change_logo3/og_image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

I am sure there are loads of opportunities in countries like India,\" he said.\n\n\"The question, however, is whether we have any advantage or insights into those businesses in India or any contacts that will make possible transactions that Berkshire would like to participate in. That is something a more energetic management at Berkshire could pursue,\" the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said.\n\nBuffett, 93, said Berkshire has a great reputation around the world. He said, his Japanese experience has been fascinating enough.\n\n\"There may be an unexplored or an unattended opportunity...but that may be something in the future,\" he said about India.\n\nBuffett said the question is if Berkshire has some kind of advantage in pursuing those unattended opportunities, particularly against people who are managing other people's money and getting paid based on assets.\n\nDuring a Question and Answer session, Buffett answered several questions related to some of the key investment decisions taken by Berkshire Hathway lately.\n\nDecidedly reducing stake in Apple was one of the key topics. Buffett clarified that it had nothing to do with the long-term view on the stock and Apple will probably remain one of their largest holdings despite the recent slowdown.\n\nHe also told shareholders that Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain have proven themselves the right people to lead Berkshire after he departs.

It marked the 60th meeting Buffett has held since he took over the company in 1965, and the billionaire was energetic in his responses despite having handed off many responsibilities to Abel and Jain.\n\n\"I don't really do much, and I don't operate at the same level of efficiency that I would have 30 or 40 years ago,\" Buffett said. \"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me? It has worked out extremely well.\n\n\"The number of calls I get from managers is essentially awfully close to zero, and Greg is handling those. I don't know quite how he does it, but we've got the right person, I can tell you that,\" he added. Buffett said he feels \"fine\" but joked he shouldn't take on four-year employment contracts.\n\nBUFFETT EXPLAINS BERKSHIRE'S REDUCED STAKE IN APPLE AT ANNUAL COMPANY MEETING\n\nIn reference to Berkshire Hathaway's future capital allocation decisions, Buffett said, \"If I were on that board and making that decision, I would probably, knowing Greg, I would leave the capital allocation to Greg. He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand businesses you understand common stocks.\"\n\nAbel, who was designated to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire CEO in 2021, said, \"As we go through any transition, it's important to know that the capital allocation principles that Berkshire lives by today will continue to survive Warren.\"\n\nJain also weighed in and noted that he, as head of Berkshire's insurance business, isn't irreplaceable and that Apple CEO Tim Cook's succession of Steve Jobs showed that no executive - even those as iconic as Buffett or Jobs - is irreplaceable.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT BLASTS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ANNUAL LETTER\n\nBuffett also paid tribute to the late Charlie Munger, who died in November at the age of 99, hailing him as the \"architect of today's Berkshire.\"\n\n\"The architect is the person who dreams of and designs and finally supervises the construction of great structures. The carpenters and the beavers -- that's me -- are needed, but the architect is the genius of Berkshire,\" Buffett said. He added that Munger's design \"lives beyond his lifetime and will live far beyond mine.\"\n\nThe company kicked off the meeting with a tribute video of the two friends who first met in 1959 and spent decades working together. It also sold copies of Munger's book, \"Poor Charlie's Almanack,\" a collection of Munger's wit and wisdom, at the convention.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT PAYS TRIBUTE TO FRIEND, CHARLIE MUNGER AS 'ARCHITECT' OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY\n\n\"Charlie, in all the years we worked together, not only never once lied to me, ever, but he didn't even shape things so that he told half lies or quarter lies to sort of stack the deck in the direction he wanted to go,\" Buffett said.\n\nGiven the prominence of succession and tributes to Munger's legacy at the first annual meeting since his friend's death, Buffett also spoke broadly about his outlook on life.\n\n\"You don't know where the paths of life go. You can't beat yourself up. You try and do the things important to you. I enjoy managing money for the people who trust me. I like the feeling of being trusted. I am not looking to change much. I believe in trying to find what you're good at and what you enjoy. I think the one thing you can aspire to be is be kind,\" Buffett said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"Thank you very, very much for coming, and I not only hope that you come next year.

(AP) -- Warren Buffett's company reported a steep drop in earnings Saturday because the paper value of its investments fell, but the tens of thousands of shareholders filling an Omaha arena to hear Buffett answer questions at the annual meeting later can take heart that Berkshire's Hathaway's many businesses performed well.\n\nBerkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of the $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share, that Berkshire reported a year ago.\n\nBut those figures were heavily swayed by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. That's why Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies led a strong performance.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion revenue.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's massive cash pile continued to grow to a record $188.993 billion in the quarter. Berkshire even spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year, but its companies that include Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\nThe main arena was already three-quarters full within half an hour of the doors opening Saturday because people are always eager to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett. But a key ingredient is missing this year: It's the first meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"He was the sriracha sauce in the Berkshire Hathaway meeting,\" said investor Bill Smead, a regular at the event for 14 years. \"He gave it a lot of flavor.\"\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nEARNINGS BEFORE MUSINGS\n\nThe day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA NOTABLE ABSENCE\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests,

(AP) -- Tens of thousands of investors once again descended on an Omaha, Nebraska, arena Saturday to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffett. But a key ingredient will be missing from his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders' meeting: It's the first since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died.\n\n\"He was the sriracha sauce in the Berkshire Hathaway meeting,\" said investor Bill Smead, a regular at the event for 14 years. \"He gave it a lot of flavor.\"\n\nFor decades, Munger shared the stage with Buffett every year for the marathon question and answer session that is the event's centerpiece. Munger routinely let Buffett take the lead with expansive responses that went on for several minutes. Then Munger himself would cut directly to the point. He is remembered for calling cryptocurrencies stupid, telling people to \"marry the best person that will have you\" and comparing many unproven internet businesses in 2000 to \"turds.\"\n\nHe and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. Together, they transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nSaturday is set to kick off with the company releasing its first quarter earnings a couple of hours before the meeting. In addition to its biggest interests, Berkshire Hathaway owns a vast collection of manufacturing and retail businesses, including Dairy Queen and See's Candy. Its massive stock portfolio is anchored by huge stakes in companies including Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting with a bit of a heavy heart because of Munger's absence.\n\nThat absence, however, may well create space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units, and Greg Abel, who handles everything else. Abel will one day replace the 93-year-old Buffett as CEO.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he hopes Abel will speak up more this year and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about. Ever since Munger let it slip at the annual meeting three years ago that Abel would be the successor, Buffett has repeatedly reassured investors that he's confident in the pick.\n\nExperts say the company has a solid culture built on integrity, trust, independence and an impressive management roster ready to take over.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

It was presided over by renowned investor Warren Buffett, who shared his thoughts on the stock market and the reasoning behind changes in his stock portfolio.\n\nOn May 4, it was revealed that Buffett's portfolio underwent significant adjustments. These changes included a 13% reduction in the holding of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock compared to the previous quarterly report.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's first-quarter earnings report, released on Saturday, revealed that its investment in Apple was valued at $135.4 billion, indicating approximately 790 million shares. This reflects a decrease of around 13% in the stake. Despite this decline, Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding by a significant margin.\n\nThis marks the second consecutive quarter in which the Omaha-based conglomerate has reduced its stake in the tech giant.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, it sold approximately 10 million Apple shares, representing just 1% of its substantial stake. Considering Apple's stock price change, this latest filing suggests that Berkshire sold approximately 116 million shares.\n\nDuring Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett indicated that the sale of Apple shares was driven by tax considerations due to significant gains. He hinted that it might also be a move to preemptively avoid higher tax liabilities in the future, especially if rates increase to address the growing U.S. fiscal deficit.\n\nDespite the sale, Berkshire remains Apple's top shareholder among non-exchange-traded fund (ETF) providers.\n\nAlthough there was little buying activity in the first quarter, Buffett reduced his stake in Chevron (NYSE: CVX) by 2%. This starkly contrasts with the previous quarter, when he added 14.37% more CVX shares, possibly indicating a shift in preference towards increased investment in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY).\n\nRegarding Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA), Buffett stated that 'they sold it all,' indicating a continuation of the trend from the previous quarter, where PARA stock is no longer part of Buffett's portfolio.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's cash reserves have reached record highs and continue to increase, highlighting the challenge of finding investment opportunities that meet Warren Buffett's criteria.\n\nBuffett emphasized at the annual general meeting that they only invest in opportunities they find favorable. As of March, Berkshire's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term Treasurys amounted to $189 billion, marking a 13% increase from the end of 2023.\n\nBuffett projected that these reserves will likely reach around $200 billion by the end of the current quarter.\n\nThis could prove a substantial war chest if Berkshire Hathaway decides to invest in some new opportunity on the stock market or substantially increase its already-owned holdings.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro - trusted and advanced investment platform", "source": {"uri": "finbold.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finbold"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elmaz_sabovic@finbold.com", "name": "Elmaz Sabovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EToro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occidental Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/05/Warren-Buffett-just-updated-his-portfolio-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 89, "textEnd": 94, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

(NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) announced its first-quarter results on Saturday, with the investment guru hosting the annual shareholder event in Omaha, Nebraska. A regulatory filing also showed a second straight quarter of trimming its Apple stake. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk saw this as a potential opportunity for Berkshire to invest in the electric vehicle maker.\n\nWhat Happened: A Tesla fan following the weekend shareholder meeting offered some advice to Buffett on social media: \"C'mon Warren Buffett, sell all your $AAPL and buy $TSLA.\"\n\nBerkshire's Apple Holding: At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire's Apple holding stood at $135.4 billion, down over 22% from the previous quarter. The exact number of shares will be known only when the firm files its 13F report.\n\nBased on Apple's average first-quarter stock price of $181.83, Berkshire may have held 744.65 million shares at quarter-end, lower than the 904.87 million shares at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nBuffett shrugged off the Apple reduction as a one-time move and reiterated that the iPhone maker would remain Berkshire's top holding unless it dramatically changes its capital allocation strategy.\n\nHe suggested the move aimed to bolster Berkshire's cash position and pay tax bills.\n\nMusk's Invitation: Despite Buffett's stance, Musk continues to harbor hopes for Berkshire's investment. Replying to the social media post, the Tesla CEO said, \"He should take a position in Tesla. It's an obvious move.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Musk has expressed interest in Berkshire's involvement. In February 2023, when informed about Berkshire's significant cash reserves, Musk hinted at a potential investment in a company starting with \"T.\"\n\nAdditionally, Musk has mentioned an unsuccessful meeting with Charlie Munger, Berkshire's former Vice Chairman, in 2009.\n\nAt the May 2023 shareholder meeting, both Buffett and Munger acknowledged Musk's achievements. Buffett called him \"a brilliant, brilliant guy... He dreams about things and his dream has got a foundation,\" while Munger referred to him as \"brilliant.\"\n\nInvestment Philosophy Clash? The rationale behind Berkshire's lack of interest in Tesla likely stems from its value investing philosophy. Future Fund's Gary Black, a Tesla investor, has explained why Berkshire might never invest in the EV stock: \"Growth investors start with high growers and then buy those that are reasonably priced relative to intrinsic value. It's two entirely different mindsets.\"\n\nTesla's high forward price-to-earnings ratio (72.46) and lack of dividend policy make it a less attractive option for value investors like Berkshire.\n\nOn Saturday, when asked about zero-emission vehicle companies as an investment option, Buffett said he didn't believe Berkshire brought any special expertise to that field. He noted that vehicle manufacturers were better suited for such endeavors.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla faces headwinds with a slowdown in sales. The company is banking on its full self-driving technology to compensate for the weakness in its core auto business.\n\nRead Next: 'Charlie And I:' Warren Buffett Reminisces About Late Friend, Whom He Credits As 'Architect Of Today's Berkshire'\n\nImage made via photos on Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Black_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Black (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intrinsic value (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB5B115_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Should You Buy the Stock, Too? | The Motley Fool", "body": "The legendary investor thinks Apple is better than any of Berkshire Hathaway's other businesses.\n\nWarren Buffett usually doesn't bet the farm on any one stock. Most of the 40 or so stocks in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio make up less than 1% of the conglomerate's total equity investments.\n\nHowever, Apple (AAPL 5.98%) is a notable exception. A whopping 40.3% of Buffett's $336 billion portfolio was invested in the iPhone maker as of March 31 -- even after Buffett and his team trimmed their position. Should you buy Apple stock, too?\n\nTo understand why Buffett loves Apple so much, it's helpful to remember what he wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year. The legendary investor said he and his longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, were business-pickers rather than stock-pickers.\n\nBuffett holds Apple's business in high regard. At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2023, he said, \"Apple happens to be a better business than any we own.\" That says a lot, considering Berkshire owns great businesses like BNSF, Geico, and See's Candies.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook enjoys strong support from Buffett. He told CNBC last year, \"Tim Cook is one of the classiest CEOs, and he understands the business.\" Buffett noted that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs \"basically invented\" the iPhone, but Cook \"has managed that company in an extraordinary way.\"\n\nSure, Berkshire trimmed its position in Apple a little in the first quarter. Buffett said at the company's annual meeting Saturday that Apple is still \"extremely likely\" to remain its largest holding.\n\nApple has a couple of strikes against it, in my view. First, its revenue growth has been weak or nonexistent. In Apple's fiscal 2024 second quarter, the company's sales fell 4% year over year. Second, the stock's valuation is expensive in light of that meager growth. Apple's shares currently trade at more than 26 times forward earnings.\n\nSo, am I deadset against buying the stock? Nope. I agree with Buffett that the company has a wonderful business. Apple is the biggest individual stock holding in my portfolio, too.\n\nI also think the company's Worldwide Developers' Conference (WWDC) in June will provide a nice catalyst for the stock. Apple is widely expected to introduce multiple artificial intelligence (AI) products at the WWDC, with a special focus on generative AI.\n\nMost of the attention so far with generative AI has been on cloud-based applications. However, there is a huge opportunity for edge AI -- the deployment of AI apps on devices. With an installed base of over 2.2 billion devices, Apple could dominate the edge AI market.\n\nI won't be surprised if Apple's new AI offerings spark a \"super-cycle\" in iPhone upgrades over the next couple of years. As iPhone revenue goes, so goes Apple.\n\nThere's one cautionary note I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up. I don't think it's wise to copy Buffett in every respect concerning Apple. In particular, most investors shouldn't put 40.3% of their portfolio (or anywhere close to that level) in only one stock.\n\nBuffett once said, \"Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.\" However, the reality is that most investors (including yours truly) are ignorant. We don't know all we need to know to bet the farm on an individual stock, even one as great as Apple.\n\nI think all of Buffett's reasons for loving Apple are good. But spread your love across more stocks in multiple industries. That way, you'll reduce the chances of losing the farm.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keith_speights@fool.com", "name": "Keith Speights", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GEICO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See's_Candies", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "See's Candies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_valuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock valuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home_Based", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/775381/buffett12-tmf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 438, "textEnd": 446}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Charlie Munger, his veteran right-hand man, died in November, aged 99.\n\nAddressing Saturday's meeting, Buffett insisted his belief in Apple - whose CEO, Tim Cook, was in the room - had not wavered. The tech giant will remain Berkshire's largest investment \"unless something dramatic happens\", he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Apple reported that its sales had declined for the fifth time in six quarters as it grapples with weaker demand for the iPhone.\n\n\"We own [shares in] American Express, which is a wonderful business,\" Buffett said. \"We own [shares in] Coca-Cola, which is a wonderful business. And we own [shares in] Apple, which is an even better business.\"\n\nBerkshire will probably still be a big shareholder in Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola \"when Greg takes over this place\", said Buffett, who has lined up Greg Abel, a veteran executive, as his successor.\n\nBuffett is the world's ninth-richest person, according to Bloomberg, with a personal fortune of $132bn. After taking control of Berkshire in 1965, he transformed it from a struggling textiles business into a vast multinational, generating handsome returns for shareholders.\n\nToday, Berkshire owns a complex array of businesses, from railroads and running shoes to insurance, peanut brittle and Squishmallows stuffed toys. It also boasts an investment portfolio worth $336bn.\n\nBill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder; Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citigroup; and Bill Murray, the actor and comedian, were among those in attendance at the annual meeting on Saturday.\n\nBuffett predicted his conglomerate's huge cash pile will top $200bn later this year after it rose to a record $189bn in the last quarter. Its operating profits, which exclude some of its investment returns, rose 39% to $11.22bn during the quarter.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callum_jones@theguardian.com", "name": "Callum Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woodstock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_magnate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business magnate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffed_toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuffed toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peanut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb60ee3f2c2f541177ded14de493dfd352b4b710/0_167_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=107d44e3f98c9e0f00847c666de22f39", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Shareholders are eager for insights into succession planning and Berkshire's growth strategies going forward.\n\nBerkshire without Munger\n\nThe absence of Charlie Munger, a pivotal figure and Buffett's trusted partner at Berkshire, significantly alters the dynamic.

Abel and Jain, appointed vice chairmen in 2018 to oversee Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance sectors respectively, have assumed more prominent roles in recent years. Munger previously hinted at Abel as Buffett's potential successor during the 2021 annual meeting, a notion subsequently confirmed by Buffett to CNBC.\n\nAlso Read: First Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting without Charlie Munger; likely questions for Warren Buffett\n\nBuffett told CNBC, \"The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who'd take over tomorrow morning.\"\n\nEarnings and prospects\n\nBerkshire is poised to unveil its first-quarter earnings just ahead of the AGM. The spotlight will be on the company's substantial cash reserves, which have swelled to record levels in recent quarters.\n\nFocus on Apple, mystery stock\n\nInvestors await Berkshire's Form 13-F, disclosing any alterations to its portfolio in the first quarter, eagerly seeking insights into Buffett's investment philosophy. The deadline for Form 13-F submissions for the first quarter is May 15.\n\nOf particular intrigue is a mystery stock acquired by Berkshire late last year. The company requested confidentiality from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAlso Read: Buffett retakes the stage as Berkshire prepares to pass the baton\n\nIn prior disclosures, Berkshire reduced its holdings in Apple, Paramount Global, and HP while increasing stakes in Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, and Sirius XM Holdings as of December 2023.

I am sure there are loads of opportunities in countries like India,'' he said. \"The question, however, is whether we have any advantage or insights into those businesses in India or any contacts that will make possible transactions that Berkshire would like to participate in. That is something a more energetic management at Berkshire could pursue,\" the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said.\n\nBuffett, 93, said Berkshire has a great reputation around the world. He said, his Japanese experience has been fascinating enough. ''There may be an unexplored or an unattended opportunity...but that may be something in the future,'' he said about India.\n\nBuffett said the question is if Berkshire has some kind of advantage in pursuing those unattended opportunities, particularly against people who are managing other people's money and getting paid based on assets.\n\nDuring a Question and Answer session, Buffett answered several questions related to some of the key investment decisions taken by Berkshire Hathway lately. Decidedly reducing stake in Apple was one of the key topics. Buffett clarified that it had nothing to do with the long-term view on the stock and Apple will probably remain one of their largest holdings despite the recent slowdown.\n\nHe also told shareholders that Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain have proven themselves the right people to lead Berkshire after he departs.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_15_04_07_0802794.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The conglomerate appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings in the quarter.\n\nThe sale resulted in Berkshire realizing an $11.2 billion after-tax gain in the quarter from its sale of Apple stock and contributed to the rise in the company's cash holdings to a record of $189 billion. Despite Berkshire reducing its holdings in Apple, Buffett said he expects it to remain the company's largest stock investment.\n\n\"We have sold shares and I would say that at the end of the year I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have,\" Buffett said. He went on to explain how he and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, viewed their stock investments in companies like Apple.\n\nBUFFETT RETAKES THE STAGE AS BERKSHIRE PREPARES TO PASS THE BATON\n\n\"One interesting thing is that Charlie and I looked at common stocks or marketable equities or the things that people love to look at as being businesses, and so when we own a Dairy Queen, or we own whatever it may be, we look at it as a business. When we own Coca-Cola or American Express or Apple, we look at that as a business,\" Buffett explained.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"Now, we can buy really wonderful companies in the market as businesses -- we can't buy all of their shares, we can't buy 90% or 80% or anything like that,\" he added.\n\nBuffett went on to say those companies and Apple are \"wonderful\" businesses and that Berkshire's assessment of those firms is such that they'll remain major holdings unless something dramatic occurs.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT PAYS TRIBUTE TO FRIEND, CHARLIE MUNGER AS 'ARCHITECT' OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY\n\n\"We will own -- unless something really extraordinary happens -- we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" Buffett said.\n\nLater in the question-and-answer session, Buffett cited Apple CEO Tim Cook's leadership as a reason for his confidence in the tech giant and said he has been a great successor to the late Steve Jobs.\n\nBuffett also touched on the tax consequences of selling Apple stock at this time when the capital gains tax rate is lower than it has been historically and said that it may be higher again in the future as the government looks to narrow the budget deficit. He also said that given alternatives in the market and uncertainty around the world, holding a larger cash stake is preferable.\n\nWARREN BUFFET BLASTS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ANNUAL LETTER\n\n\"I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what's available in the equity markets and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"Almost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it's been 52% in the past when I've been operating,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope that with all that America has done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it and if I'm doing it at 21%, and we're doing it at a lot higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he explained.\n\nOriginal article source: Buffett explains Berkshire's reduced stake in Apple at annual company meeting", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Buffett disclosed during the annual general meeting that Abel had also played a role in Berkshire's failed bid for technology distributor Tech Data in 2019.\n\nIt was unclear if Abel would want to run the common stock portfolio himself, or simply have the investment managers report to him, allowing them to make their own trades.\n\nLast year, Abel told CNBC that Combs and Weschler ran their own portfolios \"and that's the way it'll always be, and they'll manage it accordingly\".\n\n\"I may ask them: 'That was really interesting. What triggered your interest?'\" Abel said of his conversations with Combs and Weschler over their stock investments. \"But that's the extent of it. And outside of having relationships with both of them, which are important, that's their portfolio.\"\n\nBuffett in recent years has talked about how he shares similar views on capital allocation to Abel, who rose through the company's utility business and now has oversight over all of its non-insurance operations as vice-chair. He added that his decision was influenced by the sheer size of Berkshire. \"We do not want to try and have 200 people around that are managing $1bn each.\"\n\nChristopher Rossbach, the chief investment officer of Berkshire shareholder J Stern & Co, said the comment by Buffett was \"very significant\" as it showed \"part of the path forward\". He added that it raised new questions, including how Abel would approach managing the stock portfolio.\n\n\"We have not heard much from Greg yet about the public investments,\" Rossbach said. \"It's going to be part of this ongoing transition, to learn more about how that business is going to be structured, and then also more about how Greg Abel thinks of it.\"\n\nCompared to previous years, Abel took on a larger role at Saturday's meeting, the first since Buffett's longtime business partner and Berkshire vice-chair Charlie Munger died in November. Buffett also turned the official portion of the day -- when shareholder proposals were voted on -- over to Abel to lead, citing trouble with his own voice and eyesight.\n\nAbel spent the day sitting next to Buffett on stage for both the morning and afternoon sessions; vice-chair Ajit Jain, who runs the insurance operations, only joined for the first part of the day. Abel appeared relaxed as he spoke about how the BNSF railroad was performing, how Buffett had approached his investment in Occidental Petroleum, as well as how it was handling litigation over wildfires -- including its push to get state laws passed that would limit its liabilities in future catastrophes.\n\n\"We don't want to throw good capital after bad capital,\" Abel said of the utility business following the wildfires, repeating a comment Buffett made in his annual letter in February. \"We'll be very disciplined there.\"\n\nInvestors have seen Abel as a strong operator of Berkshire's underlying businesses, helping improve margins and profitability at the company, a point Buffett credited him with on Saturday.\n\n\"If you have 20 children and you are very rich you'll have some that will be go-getters anyway and you'll have some that won't,\" Buffett said. \"We are a very, very rich company and we haven't had a history of being very tough on people that coasted.\"\n\n\"Greg will do something about it,\" he added.\n\nAt the start, Buffett mistakenly referred to Abel as \"Charlie\" when passing a question to him. The packed arena -- so full that hundreds of people sat behind the stage, unable to see Buffett in the flesh -- broke into a thunderous applause.\n\n\"I'm so used to\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009\" he said, before laughing. \"I checked myself a couple times already. I'll slip again.\"\n\nAsked what he would do if he had one more day with Munger, Buffett replied: \"We had a lot of fun doing anything. We'd play golf together. We'd play tennis together. We did everything together\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we had as much fun, perhaps even more to some extent, with things that failed because then we really had to work.\"\n\nMunger's death emphasised the fact that there may not be many more meetings featuring Buffett. Dominic Evans, who travelled to Omaha from London, got in line at 4:45am so he could get a good seat. He said he wanted to come to \"show his support\" for Buffett.\n\n\"Bring out the Kleenex for this year because, you know, you've lost somebody who's a great teacher,\" he said. \"Luckily, so much of his material is already out there\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but, you know, it's going to be irreplaceable.\"\n\nBuffett acknowledged his mortality several times on Saturday. He told shareholders: \"I not only hope you come next year, but I hope I come next year.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [],

When Buffett makes a move, the world pays attention.\n\nHowever, along with the fame of being one of the richest people in the world come judgments and perceptions that aren't true. Here are seven myths about Warren Buffett you should dash from your beliefs today.\n\nGiven Berkshire Hathaway's success at making money, it's easy to imagine that Buffett bought the company knowing full well it would one day reap him and others so much money.\n\nHowever, it actually started out as a textile company on the edge of failure. He believed that he could make money by shoring up what he thought would be one of the last remaining textile mills in the country. In fact, even though the industry was in peril, Buffett bought another textile mill in 1975, too.\n\nWhile he certainly had confidence in his ability to turn a profit, even he couldn't have envisioned just how successful he would go on to become.\n\nWhile some billionaires invest in risky and speculative things like art and cryptocurrencies, Buffett has been known for taking more of a tried and true path. This has led many to believe he only invests in stocks, particularly dividend-earning ones of companies with a solid history of stability and profitability.\n\nYet in August 2023, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway had purchased $10 billion in U.S. Treasurys and planned to buy another $10 billion worth.\n\nWith a reputation for making researched, thoughtful and careful investments, it's easy to believe that Buffett never makes rash decisions, either. And while that is true for the most part, even Buffett wasn't immune to the panic that followed the COVID-19 pandemic's economic losses.\n\nBuffett sold off most of his stocks in airlines when they had bottomed out due to a lack of travel, losing him billions of dollars. Those stocks ended up rebounding by the end of 2020, but Buffett could not recoup those losses.\n\nA man as old school and frugal as Buffett might be seen to adhere to that old adage \"cash is king\" and be sure to keep a lot of it on hand. Yet, in a 2009 interview with Charlie Rose, Buffett said that cash is actually a bad choice for anyone who hopes to maintain or grow their wealth, because cash only loses value over time. While cash can give you security, it can't earn you more of itself.\n\nBuffett is old enough to have started investing at a time when technology stocks were very much in their infancy. As tech boomed, while there were years Buffett avoided tech stocks, even the old luddite came on board by investing in Apple, which now comprises more than 42.5% of his portfolio.\n\nAnyone who thinks Buffett lives a flashy life hasn't been paying attention. Unlike other billionaires who seem happy to flash their fancy cars, expensive yachts and other big expenditures, Buffett is famously frugal, driving a modest car, living in the same home he has for years and even eating at McDonalds. You won't find the Berkshire-Hathaway chairman flashing expensive watches or suits -- he's a practical man.\n\nHowever, this has led to another myth, which is that he practices and preaches an \"extreme\" frugality -- which is just not true. At the 2008 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, Buffett said he does not advocate extreme frugality.\n\nWhile he admits to being a fan of \"living within your income,\" he said that if you're making a reasonable income and have safety nets like retirement accounts, there's no harm in spending extra on things like a family vacation. He even said there are advantages to spending money on your family.\n\nIt's easy for people to both project beliefs onto a man in Buffett's position and to assume things about him. Buffett lives a transparent enough life that anyone can quickly glean online that what you see is pretty much what you get when it comes to the Oracle of Omaha.", "source": {"uri": "gobankingrates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GOBankingRates"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Textile manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_safety_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social safety net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luddite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9665074s.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

David A. Grogen | CNBCBerkshire Hathaway reported Saturday a huge year-over-year increase in operating earnings in the first quarter, while its cash holdings bubbled to record levels.The Warren Buffett-led conglomerate posted an operating profit -- which encompasses earnings from the company's wholly owned businesses -- that surged 39% to $11.22 billion from the year-earlier period.That gain was led by a 185% year-on-year increase in insurance underwriting earnings to $2.598 billion from just $911 million. Insurance investment income also swelled 32% to more than $2.5 billion.Berkshire's railroad business raked in $1.14 billion in profit, down slightly from the first quarter of 2023. Its energy division saw earnings nearly double to $717 million from $416 million a year prior.First-quarter net earnings, which include fluctuations from Berkshires stock investments, fell 64% to $12.7 billion. However, this is because of massive gains in Berkshire's stock portfolio as the market surged to start 2023. Buffett calls these unrealized investing gains (or losses) each quarter meaningless and misleading, but the unique conglomerate is required to report these numbers based on generally accepted accounting principles.Record cash hoardThe company's cash hoard reached a record high of $188.99 billion, up from $167.6 billion in the fourth quarter. That massive holding, well above a CFRA Research estimate of more than $170 billion, points to Buffett's inability to find a suitable major acquisition target -- which he has lamented in recent years.The report comes ahead the company's annual shareholder meeting, known as \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\" Buffett will answer questions from shareholders on everything ranging from the conglomerate's holdings as well as his thoughts on investing and the economy.This will also be the first annual meeting since the death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger in November.Year to date, Berkshire Class A shares are up more than 11%, reaching an all-time high in late February. The Class B stock, meanwhile, has gained more than 12% in that time.Check out CNBC's full coverage of this year's annual meeting here. ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class A share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woodstock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

It's just a wonderful thing to behold,\" said Maria Hokanson, an executive vice president of marketing at Dairy Queen.\n\nHokanson spoke as a never-ending line of people purchased Dilly Bars in a variety of flavors including peanuts and fudge, chocolate, cherry and even a non-dairy Dilly Bar which California friends Sucy Thibo and Liz Muench agreed was \"really good.\"\n\nAll proceeds from the Dairy Queen ice cream treats -- which were being sold for $1 each -- will be donated to Children's Nebraska, Hokanson said.\n\nAt the Squishmallows booth, shareholders waited in line for a chance to jump in the plush toy pit. Similar long lines were present at the See's Candies and Fruit of the Loom retail areas, which offered discounts on candy and underwear.\n\nAt Justin Boots, every sales associate was busy helping shareholders try on and purchase cowboy boots, including the signature smooth ostrich boots that offer many different types of toe rows including square and rubber.\n\n\"Cowboy boots are a really unique thing,\" said John Heron, president of Born Shoes, which sells Justin Boots. \"It's a real personal purchase. People take a lot of time to go through different styles.\"\n\nRobby Elias and Roxanne Daggett stopped in Omaha on their way back to Minnesota from Naples, Florida. They had taken advantage of deals offered by many Berkshire-owned businesses including Nebraska Furniture Mart, Pampered Chef and Fruit of the Loom.\n\nAs happy as they were to snag the deals, Elias and Daggett were also happy standing in line and meeting shareholders from all over the world.\n\n\"You have to give credit to Berkshire and Warren Buffett -- bringing in all the people that are so excited about Berkshire,\" Daggett said.\n\nThe excitement around hearing and seeing Buffett speak never gets old for William Casto, who has made the trip from Brazil to Omaha for the shareholders meeting three years in a row. Traveling this year with his significant other Julia Severo, Casto hangs on every word Buffett says.\n\nAs he and Severo ate their Dilly Bars, Casto said he'll miss seeing Munger sitting alongside Buffett at the podium on Saturday. This year's shareholders meeting marks the first meeting since Munger's death in November. I feel this bit could be higher in the story.\n\n\"I'm going to hold (back) tears,\" Casto said. \"It's quite emotional. It's like a couple that had been together for so long.\"\n\nAt the Squishmallows booth, it was apparent just how tightly shareholders want to hold on to Buffett and Munger. Before the first hour of the shopping event had passed, the 16-inch version of the Buffett and Munger plush toys sold out, said Sara Rosales, senior vice president for Squishmallow brand producer Jazwares. The 10-inch plush version of the dynamic duo was also flying off the shelves.\n\n\"Last year, we were selling about 1,000 Warren and Charlie Squishmallows per hour. The goal was to beat that this year,\" Rosales said. \"I think we're well on our way.\"\n\nPhotos: 2024 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType":

Thousands of people have gathered in Omaha, Nebraska to hear Buffett talk about the first-quarter earnings and the economy at the company's annual meeting.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from Berkshire's earnings was another record in its cash and U.S. Treasury holdings. The company now holds $36 billion in cash and $153 billion in Treasurys, for a total cash hoard of $189 billion.\n\nInvestors will be looking at Buffett to provide some clues about where this money could be deployed or which pockets of the markets he finds attractive.\n\nBuffett said in the company's annual letter this year that \"only a handful of companies\" in the U.S. met the Berkshire investment criteria, adding that \"there are essentially no candidates,\" elsewhere in the world.\n\nOperating earnings at the conglomerate rose to $11.2 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up from $8.06 billion in the same period a year ago. Net income, an ineffective gauge according to Buffett because of unrealized investment gains or losses, was $12.7 billion, down compared to $35.5 billion for the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company had growing results in both its insurance and railroad businesses. Insurance investment income continued to improve, returning $21.5 billion in insurance premiums during the first quarter, up from $19.8 billion a year ago.\n\nSurging auto insurance costs have been a big driver of profits, increasing at the fastest pace since 1976 at the tail end of 2023. A recent report also found home insurance premiums to be spiking, with homes covered for $250,000 seeing a 23% increase from 2023.\n\nThe railroad, utilities and energy businesses will be in focus due to volatile commodity prices. The company reported $24.4 billion in segment revenues for the quarter, up from $21.9 billion a year ago.\n\nBuffett was bullish on the future of railroads in his annual letter.\n\n\"A century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of Berkshire.

(AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter profits plummeted along with the paper value of its investments, but the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright performed well.\n\nThe company reported reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's roughly one-third of last year's $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share.\n\nThe figures were heavily influenced by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire's investments. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year's $8.065 billion as its insurance companies showed strong results.\n\nPeople are also reading...

At $135.4 billion, the iPhone maker still accounts for the biggest share of Berkshire's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects it to remain so even up to when his successor Greg Abel takes over.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe estimated value of Berkshire's Apple stake suggests Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. In the past, Buffett has said he invested in Apple's stock because of how devoted consumers are to the company's products, similar to consumer brands he loves like Berkshire's own See's Candy.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago, as Geico in particular continued to improve its results. However, BNSF railroad's profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion.\n\nMost of Berkshire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit, adding $717 million to Berkshire's total.\n\nRevenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire's cash pile climbed to a record $188.993 billion even after it spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year. Holdings including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we're doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And he's seen how", "body": "By JOSH FUNK - AP Business Writer\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial intelligence scams could become \"the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nDoubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI. And it looked and sounded just like him. Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that the so-called Oracle of Omaha himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money overseas.\n\nThe billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the technology, and may do more harm with it than society can wring good.\n\n\"As someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it, it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm and I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The company reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago.\n\nBut Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate's operating earnings from the companies it actually owns. Those jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by insurance companies' performance.\n\nNone of it that got in the way of the fun.\n\nThrongs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallows of Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The event attracts investors from all over the world and is unlike any other company meeting. Those attending for the first time are driven by an urgency to get here while the 93-year-old Buffett is still alive.\n\n\"This is one of the best events in the world to learn about investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,\" said Akshay Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to Omaha.\n\nA NOTABLE ABSENCE\n\nDevotees come from all over the world to vacuum up tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed the meeting 'Woodstock for Capitalists.'\n\nBut a key ingredient was missing this year: It was the first meeting since Munger died.\n\nThe meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his best known quotes, including classic lines like \"If people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich.\" The video also featured skits the investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a \"Desperate Housewives\" spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned over him.\n\nAs the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation honoring Munger, whom Buffett called \"the architect of Berkshire Hathaway.\"\n\nBuffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and holding regular Zoom calls.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Like his hero Ben Franklin, Charlie wanted to understand everything,\" Buffett said.\n\nFor decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo, with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger's witty one-liners. He once referred to unproven internet companies as \"turds.\"\n\nTogether, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major utilities and an assortment of other companies.\n\nMunger often summed up the key Berkshire's success as \"trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.\" He and Buffett also were known for sticking to businesses they understood well.\n\n\"Warren always did at least 80% of the talking. But Charlie was a great foil,\" said Stansberry Research analyst Whitney Tilson, who was looking forward to his 27th consecutive meeting.\n\nNEXT GEN LEADERS\n\nMunger's absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire's companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who handles everything else and has been named Buffett's successor. The two shared the main stage with Buffett this year.\n\nThe first time Buffett kicked a question to Abel, he mistakenly said \"Charlie?\" Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some regulators' reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit.\n\nMorningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire executives talk about.\n\n\"Greg's a rock star,\" said Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group. \"The bench is deep. He won't have the same humor at the meeting. But I think we all come here to get a reminder every year to be rational.\"\n\nA LOOK TO THE FUTURE\n\nBuffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire's next CEO, but he said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company's investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions.\n\n\"He understands businesses extremely well. and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks,\" Buffett said. Ultimately, it will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently.\n\nOverall, Buffett said Berkshire's system of having all the noninsurance companies report to Abel and the insurers report to Jain is working well. He himself hardly gets any calls from managers anymore because they get more guidance from Abel and Jain.\n\n\"This place would work extremely well the next day if something happened to me,\" Buffett said.\n\nNevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett's closing remark: \"I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come next year.\" ___\n\nFor more AP coverage of Warren Buffett look here: https://apnews.com/hub/warren-buffett.

He shows this by growing his massive cash position to $200 billion, selling Apple (AAPL) shares and saying that he doesn't see bargains,\" Smead Capital Management CIO and long-time Buffett watcher Bill Smead told me on the grounds of the Woodstock of Capitalism.\n\nBerkshire's decision to reduce its stake in Apple and boost the company's cash position is a move that Buffett says makes sense given the current macroeconomic environment.\n\n\"I don't think anyone sitting at this table has any idea how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,\" Buffett said in response to a shareholder question of why Berkshire isn't putting the cash reserve to work.\n\n\"As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong\" and you want to be able to \"act when that happens,\" Buffett added.\n\nThe bears have some meat to feast on, compliments of Buffett.\n\nBerkshire reduced its position in Apple by about 13% during the first three months of the year, marking the second quarter in a row that the conglomerate reduced its stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nAs of March 31, Apple accounted for about 40% of Berkshire's vast stock portfolio, worth a total of $135.4 billion.\n\nBerkshire reduced its position in Apple as the tech giant has struggled in recent quarters and valuation on the stock remains elevated. The stock fell about 10% during the first three months of the year, weighing on Berkshire's quarterly results.\n\nWhile some initially looked at Buffett's decision to reduce the Apple stake as a sign that his stance on the tech beast has changed, one analyst told Yahoo Finance that \"taking a little off the top doesn't hurt.\"\n\n\"This does not concern us all that much because Apple was such a large position in the 13-F portfolio at the end of 2023, so anything to lessen that exposure is good from a diversification perspective,\" Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren told me at the meeting.\n\nThe legendary investor was also quick to reassure shareholders as to his confidence in Apple.\n\n\"At the end of the year, I would think it's extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have now,\" Buffett told a packed house, which included Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nBuffett compared Apple to two of Berkshire's most well-known, top holdings: Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP). While he called Coca-Cola and American Express \"wonderful businesses,\" he noted Apple was an \"even better business.\"\n\nWhile Buffett remains optimistic on Apple, the business does face short-term headwinds.\n\nWeakness in China has been front and center for Apple investors as it loses market share to domestic players. A more cautious US consumer hasn't aided investor sentiment, either.\n\n\"It's easy to blame the overall consumer environment but there's also a market share dynamic that's occurring with Huawei and others becoming extremely competitive,\" Ariel Investments emerging markets equities senior vice president Christine Phillpotts told me at Berkshire's annual meeting.\n\nIt's a trend that Phillpotts says will likely accelerate as domestic players continue to \"increase the value proposition.\"\n\nApple shares have declined 4.8% since the start of the year despite coming AI announcements, far underperforming the S&P 500's 8% gain.\n\nBuffett's cash hoard hints other stocks may follow Apple's lead lower as the year treks along.\n\nCurious on what Apple is up against in terms of AI competition?

It's full of luxurious experiences for Berkshire shareholders, including cocktails, shopping for exclusive jewelry and furniture from top designers, and lots of Dairy Queen (which is owned by Berkshire).", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woodstock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_Queen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/adb5bf36d286fdbbbc6b57856dcaefba.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

When Buffett makes a move, the world pays attention.\n\nHowever, along with the fame of being one of the richest people in the world come judgments and perceptions that aren't true. Here are seven myths about Warren Buffett you should dash from your beliefs today.\n\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\n\nGiven Berkshire Hathaway's success at making money, it's easy to imagine that Buffett bought the company knowing full well it would one day reap him and others so much money.\n\nHowever, it actually started out as a textile company on the edge of failure. He believed that he could make money by shoring up what he thought would be one of the last remaining textile mills in the country. In fact, even though the industry was in peril, Buffett bought another textile mill in 1975, too.\n\nWhile he certainly had confidence in his ability to turn a profit, even he couldn't have envisioned just how successful he would go on to become.\n\nLearn More: 16 Tips To Live Well on a Low Salary, According to Dave Ramsey\n\nWhile some billionaires invest in risky and speculative things like art and cryptocurrencies, Buffett has been known for taking more of a tried and true path. This has led many to believe he only invests in stocks, particularly dividend-earning ones of companies with a solid history of stability and profitability.\n\nYet in August 2023, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway had purchased $10 billion in U.S. Treasurys and planned to buy another $10 billion worth.\n\nWith a reputation for making researched, thoughtful and careful investments, it's easy to believe that Buffett never makes rash decisions, either. And while that is true for the most part, even Buffett wasn't immune to the panic that followed the COVID-19 pandemic's economic losses.\n\nBuffett sold off most of his stocks in airlines when they had bottomed out due to a lack of travel, losing him billions of dollars. Those stocks ended up rebounding by the end of 2020, but Buffett could not recoup those losses.\n\nA man as old school and frugal as Buffett might be seen to adhere to that old adage \"cash is king\" and be sure to keep a lot of it on hand. Yet, in a 2009 interview with Charlie Rose, Buffett said that cash is actually a bad choice for anyone who hopes to maintain or grow their wealth, because cash only loses value over time. While cash can give you security, it can't earn you more of itself.\n\nBuffett is old enough to have started investing at a time when technology stocks were very much in their infancy. As tech boomed, while there were years Buffett avoided tech stocks, even the old luddite came on board by investing in Apple, which now comprises more than 42.5% of his portfolio.\n\nAnyone who thinks Buffett lives a flashy life hasn't been paying attention. Unlike other billionaires who seem happy to flash their fancy cars, expensive yachts and other big expenditures, Buffett is famously frugal, driving a modest car, living in the same home he has for years and even eating at McDonalds. You won't find the Berkshire-Hathaway chairman flashing expensive watches or suits -- he's a practical man.\n\nHowever, this has led to another myth, which is that he practices and preaches an \"extreme\" frugality -- which is just not true. At the 2008 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, Buffett said he does not advocate extreme frugality.\n\nWhile he admits to being a fan of \"living within your income,\" he said that if you're making a reasonable income and have safety nets like retirement accounts, there's no harm in spending extra on things like a family vacation. He even said there are advantages to spending money on your family.\n\nIt's easy for people to both project beliefs onto a man in Buffett's position and to assume things about him. Buffett lives a transparent enough life that anyone can quickly glean online that what you see is pretty much what you get when it comes to the Oracle of Omaha.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

At the time, he was ambivalent, saying \"we'll see what happens.\"\n\nThe company's bum Paramount bet made Buffett think deeper about the industry, he told shareholders.\n\n\"I certainly thought harder even about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort, whether it's sports or movies or whatever it might be,\" Buffett said.\n\nSeveral interested parties have targeted Paramount for acquisition, including Sony and private equity firm Apollo and David Ellison's Skydance Media. On Sunday, Paramount officially opened negotiations with Sony and Apollo, the New York Times reported.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway reported a $12.7 billion profit for the first quarter, a drop from the $35.5 billion it netted in the same quarter a year prior. The decline was mostly due to a drop-off in the paper value of its holdings, and Buffett encouraged investors to look instead at the company's operating earnings which exclude its investments. The company's operating earnings skyrocketed 39% year-over-year, coming in at about $11.2 billion.\n\nThe annual meeting over the weekend was the first since Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died in November at the age of 99. Buffett seemed reflective as he noted Munger's absence, wrapping up the meeting with somber thoughts.\n\n\"I not only hope you come next year. I hope I come next year,\" he said.\n\nStill, when it comes to his stock bets, the legendary investor was just as keen as ever, and even at 93 years old, learning from his mistakes -- the hard way.\n\n\"I think I'm smarter now than I was a couple years ago,\" Buffett said. \"But I also think I'm poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the manner I did.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Production company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skydance_Media", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skydance Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private equity firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-849879448-e1715023445228.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The conglomerate appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings in the quarter.\n\nThe sale resulted in Berkshire realizing an $11.2 billion after-tax gain in the quarter from its sale of Apple stock and contributed to the rise in the company's cash holdings to a record of $189 billion. Despite Berkshire reducing its holdings in Apple, Buffett said he expects it to remain the company's largest stock investment.\n\n\"We have sold shares and I would say that at the end of the year I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have,\" Buffett said. He went on to explain how he and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, viewed their stock investments in companies like Apple.\n\nBUFFETT RETAKES THE STAGE AS BERKSHIRE PREPARES TO PASS THE BATON\n\n\"One interesting thing is that Charlie and I looked at common stocks or marketable equities or the things that people love to look at as being businesses, and so when we own a Dairy Queen, or we own whatever it may be, we look at it as a business. When we own Coca-Cola or American Express or Apple, we look at that as a business,\" Buffett explained.\n\n\"Now, we can buy really wonderful companies in the market as businesses -- we can't buy all of their shares, we can't buy 90% or 80% or anything like that,\" he added.\n\nBuffett went on to say those companies and Apple are \"wonderful\" businesses and that Berkshire's assessment of those firms is such that they'll remain major holdings unless something dramatic occurs.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT PAYS TRIBUTE TO FRIEND, CHARLIE MUNGER AS 'ARCHITECT' OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY\n\n\"We will own -- unless something really extraordinary happens -- we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" Buffett said.\n\nLater in the question-and-answer session, Buffett cited Apple CEO Tim Cook's leadership as a reason for his confidence in the tech giant and said he has been a great successor to the late Steve Jobs.\n\nBuffett also touched on the tax consequences of selling Apple stock at this time when the capital gains tax rate is lower than it has been historically and said that it may be higher again in the future as the government looks to narrow the budget deficit. He also said that given alternatives in the market and uncertainty around the world, holding a larger cash stake is preferable.\n\nWARREN BUFFET BLASTS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ANNUAL LETTER\n\n\"I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what's available in the equity markets and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"Almost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it's been 52% in the past when I've been operating,\" Buffett said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope that with all that America has done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it and if I'm doing it at 21%, and we're doing it at a lot higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he explained.", "source": {"uri": "foxbusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_revell@foxbusiness.com", "name": "Eric Revell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_Queen", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital gains tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1024/512/Warren-Buffett-Berkshire-Hathaway.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 427, "textEnd": 435}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Operating earnings also rose, buoyed by his collection of insurance businesses.\n\nThe firm's hoard increased to $US189 billion ($290 billion) at the end of the first quarter, topping the record it set at year-end. The company also reported first-quarter operating earnings of $US11.2 billion, versus $US8.07 billion for the same period a year earlier.\n\nBuffett, 93, in February decried a lack of meaningful deals that he said would give the firm a shot at \"eye-popping performance\". Even as the company ramped up acquisitions in recent years, including an $US11.6 billion deal to buy Alleghany and its purchase of shares in Occidental Petroleum, Berkshire has struggled to find sizable deals. That's left Buffett with more cash -- what he has called an unrivalled mountain of capital -- than he and his investing deputies could quickly deploy.\n\nAs Berkshire's annual meeting kicked off in Omaha on Saturday, Buffett said that \"it's a fair assumption\" that its cash pile will hit $US200 billion at end of this quarter. \"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money.\"\n\n\"The company will hope for an \"occasional big opportunity,\" he said.\n\nIn the absence of deals, Berkshire has turned to buying back its own shares. It spent about $US2.6 billion doing that in the first quarter, it said in its earnings statement Saturday.\n\nStill, higher interest rates helped drive up interest and other investment income to $US1.9 billion, from $US1.1 billion in the first quarter of last year.\n\n\"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. \"Rising rates are enabling Berkshire's still considerable cash balance to once again earn a competitive return.\"\n\nThe company reported a $US135.4 billion stake in Apple in that period, down from $US174.3 billion at the end of the year -- though it remains its top holding. Apple has been hit by a drumbeat of negative news, including a $US2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project.

The sale pumped up Berkshire's cash reserves big time, pushing them up to $189 billion by the end of March. Buffett insisted there was no love lost, though, chalking the decision up to a simple tax-focused decision. He went so far as to say Apple was \"even better\" than other \"wonderful\" businesses in Berkshire's portfolio, including American Express and Coca-Cola. At the same time, he maintained that he expects Apple to be the highlight of its holdings for years to come.\n\nMind you, investors aren't just interested in Berkshire's holdings. With Buffett blowing out 94 birthday candles this year, and after the passing of his long-time partner Charlie Munger, onlookers are curious about the next leader of the world-famous company. The honor looks likely to land on Greg Abel's shoulders. Buffett has complimented Abel's business acumen and capital management skills, appointing him as Berkshire's heir apparent back in 2021. If he does indeed secure the plaque, investors might not need to brace for much change: Abel seemingly shares Buffett's golden rule of betting on the US.\n\nThe bigger picture: Bills, bills, bills.\n\nBuffett's stocks may as well be playing second fiddle nowadays. The Oracle of Omaha has parked a ton of cash in Treasury bills - potentially up to $200 billion.

The truck-stop chain, which Berkshire took full ownership of early last year, grew its revenues by 32% year-on-year to $12.5 billion for the period spanning February and March.

Should You Buy the Stock, Too?", "body": "Warren Buffett usually doesn't bet the farm on any one stock. Most of the 40 or so stocks in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio make up less than 1% of the conglomerate's total equity investments.\n\nHowever, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a notable exception. A whopping 40.3% of Buffett's $336 billion portfolio was invested in the iPhone maker as of March 31 -- even after Buffett and his team trimmed their position. Should you buy Apple stock, too?\n\nTo understand why Buffett loves Apple so much, it's helpful to remember what he wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year. The legendary investor said he and his longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, were business-pickers rather than stock-pickers.\n\nBuffett holds Apple's business in high regard. At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2023, he said, \"Apple happens to be a better business than any we own.\" That says a lot, considering Berkshire owns great businesses like BNSF, Geico, and See's Candies.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook enjoys strong support from Buffett. He told CNBC last year, \"Tim Cook is one of the classiest CEOs, and he understands the business.\" Buffett noted that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs \"basically invented\" the iPhone, but Cook \"has managed that company in an extraordinary way.\"\n\nSure, Berkshire trimmed its position in Apple a little in the first quarter. Buffett said at the company's annual meeting Saturday that Apple is still \"extremely likely\" to remain its largest holding.\n\nApple has a couple of strikes against it, in my view. First, its revenue growth has been weak or nonexistent. In Apple's fiscal 2024 second quarter, the company's sales fell 4% year over year. Second, the stock's valuation is expensive in light of that meager growth. Apple's shares currently trade at more than 26 times forward earnings.\n\nSo, am I deadset against buying the stock? Nope. I agree with Buffett that the company has a wonderful business. Apple is the biggest individual stock holding in my portfolio, too.\n\nI also think the company's Worldwide Developers' Conference (WWDC) in June will provide a nice catalyst for the stock. Apple is widely expected to introduce multiple artificial intelligence (AI) products at the WWDC, with a special focus on generative AI.\n\nMost of the attention so far with generative AI has been on cloud-based applications. However, there is a huge opportunity for edge AI -- the deployment of AI apps on devices. With an installed base of over 2.2 billion devices, Apple could dominate the edge AI market.\n\nI won't be surprised if Apple's new AI offerings spark a \"super-cycle\" in iPhone upgrades over the next couple of years. As iPhone revenue goes, so goes Apple.\n\nThere's one cautionary note I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up. I don't think it's wise to copy Buffett in every respect concerning Apple. In particular, most investors shouldn't put 40.3% of their portfolio (or anywhere close to that level) in only one stock.\n\nBuffett once said, \"Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.\" However, the reality is that most investors (including yours truly) are ignorant. We don't know all we need to know to bet the farm on an individual stock, even one as great as Apple.\n\nI think all of Buffett's reasons for loving Apple are good. But spread your love across more stocks in multiple industries. That way, you'll reduce the chances of losing the farm.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $544,015!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The meeting featured a video tribute to Munger, who served as vice chairman, and praise from Buffett, who said Munger was the best person to talk to about managing money, according to remarks broadcast on CNBC.\n\n\"I trust my children and my wife totally, but that doesn't mean I ask them what stocks to buy,\" he said.\n\nArtificial intelligence risks\n\nBuffett also recalled seeing an AI-generated image of himself and warned on the technology's potential for scamming people.\n\n\"Scamming has always been part of the American scene,\" he told shareholders. \"But this would make me -- if I was interested in investing in scamming -- it's going to be the growth industry of all time.\"\n\nHe then likened AI to nuclear weapons, saying \"I don't know any way to get the genie back in the bottle, and AI is somewhat similar,\" according to CNBC.\n\nSuccession outlook\n\nBuffett, 93, had already indicated three years ago that Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel would take over for him.\n\nBut he dropped a hint on Saturday about when new management would actually come into office, saying \"you don't have too long to wait on that.\" While he said he feels fine, he quipped that he shouldn't sign any four-year employment contracts.\n\nBuffett also confirmed that Abel will be in charge of investing decisions, saying that responsibility \"ought to be entirely\" with the next CEO.\n\nQuestions had arisen about Berkshire's closely followed portfolio as Buffett has acknowledged he delegated some calls and that certain stock picks were made by others.\n\nCanada investment?\n\nBuffett has lamented the lack of attractive investment opportunities in recent years, allowing Berkshire's massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents to reach fresh record highs.\n\nIndeed, it surged to $189 billion at the end of the first quarter from $167.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nOn Saturday, Buffett reiterated that when it comes to investments, \"we only swing at pitches we like.\" But he also teased, \"We do not feel uncomfortable in any way shape or form putting our money into Canada. In fact, we're actually looking at one thing now.\"\n\nThose comments came after he touched on his investment in Japanese trading houses, saying it's \"unlikely we will make any large commitments in other countries.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Learn More\n\nLook, I'm sure that, like me, you were up at an ungodly hour on Sunday morning watching the livestream of the Berkshire Hathaway meeting, right?\n\nTruth be told (don't tell anyone, or I'll be kicked out of the investing nerds club), I wasn't either. I did get up a couple of hours early to watch the back end of it being livestreamed, and then caught up with the rest over brekky.\n\nBut perhaps I should backtrack.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is the company that's run by the world's greatest investor, Warren Buffett.\n\nBuffett, who started investing at 11, is now 93, and is, according to Forbes, the world's eighth-richest person, with a fortune estimated at US$137 billion (about $207 billion in our money).\n\nHe has smashed the market over almost 60 years, with a cumulative return of 4,384,738% between 1965 and 2023, compared to the market's 31,223%. The latter is impressive: a 300-times return. The former is astounding: a 43,800-times return!\n\nIf you prefer annual numbers, that's an average 19.8% per annum bump over 58 years, compared to the market's very good 10.2%.\n\nSo he's kind of a big deal.\n\nBut not only is he rich and successful, he walks the talk. He shares his wisdom with the general public in a 6-hour Q&A session once a year at the company's annual meeting.\n\nAnd yes, I am absolutely going to suggest you watch it! (CNBC livestreamed it and you can find it on that company's YouTube channel).\n\nWhy? Because you will truly get no better investment education - none - than reading what Buffett writes and watching him speak.\n\n(I don't want to be too prescriptive, either, but there's an argument that the individual investor who is picking stocks, but can't find the time to watch Buffett, might be doing themselves and their portfolio a huge disservice.)\n\nBut if you don't want to watch it, let me share some of the highlights from what I saw and heard.\n\nHe's missing Charlie\n\nCharlie Munger, his long time vice-Chairman, died late last year at 99. The tributes were as effusive as they were deserved. What I said about reading and listening to Buffett applies equally to Munger. The man was a polymath genius.\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting always includes an expo of sorts: a huge hall full of the company's subsidiaries selling their various merchandise, and a bookstore, which usually sells dozens and dozens of titles. This year, it only sold one: Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger. I suggest you grab a copy from your favourite bookseller!)\n\nIn prior years, Buffett usually answered questions first, then asked Charlie if he wanted to say anything. At one point this year, Buffett accidentally asked his next-in-line, Greg Abel, if he wanted to add anything, calling him 'Charlie' in an amusing, if poignant, reminder of Charlie's absence.\n\nThe company has cash. A LOT of cash\n\nBerkshire Hathaway now has around $190b worth of cash on the balance sheet. That's a lot of money in anyone's language, but is now almost one-quarter of the company's market capitalisation (total value of all the shares, put together). That's huge in general, and unusually huge for a company of that size.\n\nBuffett said he simply can't find anything attractive to do with the money, but also noted that it was earning more than 5% on the cash in government bonds, which made him feel more comfortable about the holding. He didn't say directly, but seemed to infer that if the yield was meaningfully less, he might feel differently about having that much cash.\n\nIs Buffett 'timing the market'? No. But he is content to keep his powder dry until and unless he finds something that meets his criteria. And with one additional complexity - as he says, it's hard to find deals big enough to move the needle, when you're as big as Berkshire.\n\nStay within your circle of competence\n\nIt's a recurring theme, but Buffett reminded us that he stays within his circle of competence. Asked about AI, he said didn't have views on its impact. Not that there wouldn't be an impact, but that he realised he had no special ability to opine on what it might be.\n\nThat tied in nicely to comments made in a video that was shown before the meeting, with some of Charlie Munger's past comments and highlights - that just avoiding doing dumb things can be a great contributor to investing success. Dumb things tend to happen when you don't know that you don't know... or you do, but do things anyway!\n\nRegret the right mistakes\n\nAre there really good mistakes and bad ones? Buffett seems to think so. One of his more interesting comments was that missing some opportunities didn't worry him, because he didn't understand the investment case at the time:\n\n\"Charlie and I missed a lot of things ... we never worried about missing something that we didn't understand.\"\n\nThat's a really important insight. Don't chase something just 'in case' it subsequently makes money. Don't do things other people are doing, just because they're making money. Do things only when it seems smart, based on your reasoning and experience, and don't regret the ones that got away.\n\nAnd the 'why' is important, here. Implicit in regretting the ones you didn't understand would be the assumption that you should swing at every pitch, just in case one of them turns out well. I hope I don't need to tell you that doing so would mean you'd run out of money with which to invest, but also you'd have insufficient capital invested in your best ideas.\n\nPortfolio curation is vital, if you're going to build your own portfolio (otherwise, just stick with ETFs).\n\nFiscal policy is the risk\n\nIn a comment on US policy that should have Australians thinking about the local analogs, Buffett called US Fed Chair Jerome Powell a \"very wise man\". But then added that Powell \"doesn't control fiscal policy, and every now and then he sends out a disguised plea ... because that's where the trouble will be, if we have it.\"\n\nBuffett said he wasn't concerned about the US dollar or US government bonds (known as 'Treasuries') because he didn't think there was much alternative, but the implication is clear - unchecked national debt could be more of an issue than interest rates themselves.\n\nBringing that back home, there are alternatives to the AUD and Australian government bonds, of course... and so what Buffett is (in effect) advising the US Government should be considered even more important for our federal politicians (and we have a Federal Budget coming up).\n\nHe intends to be back next year\n\nClosing the meeting, Buffett said he hoped the attendees would be back next year. Then added a joke:\n\n\"I not only hope you come next year. I hope I come next year.\"\n\nBuffett is, of course, 93. But you won't find a sharper 93 year old. At one point, he mentioned the CEO of one new subsidiary, adding, without notes, details of his family background, his schooling, his sporting career and his subsequent work career, then adding details of the number of staff in that business, the number of sites it operated and the average size of each site. That'd be impressive from the CEO of a single business. But Berkshire has dozens of subsidiaries. His recall, analysis and wit were as sharp as ever.\n\nYou may not be surprised to know that Berkshire Hathaway is my largest individual holding (only the cheap shares, unfortunately!). If you get to invest in a portfolio of partly- and wholly-owned businesses, put together by the world's greatest investor, and then have him work on your behalf every day... I think you'd need a pretty good reason not to take the opportunity!\n\nBut, whether you do that, or not, I reckon you'd be mad to ignore or avoid the investment wisdom he's imparted over the last half-century. You'll be a better investor for spending a little time taking it in.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motley Fool Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Apple sales resulted in Berkshire's realizing $11.2bn of after-tax gains in the quarter from selling investments.\n\nBuffett maintained that he doesn't mind paying taxes.\n\nPROFIT SWELLS First-quarter operating profit rose 39% to $11.22bn, or about $7,807 per Class A share, from $8.07bn a year earlier.\n\n\"Berkshire continues to benefit from attractive yields on short-term investments and large cash balances,\" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said in a research note.\n\nNet income fell 64% to $12.7bn, or $8,838 per share, from $35.5bn a year earlier, when Berkshire had large unrealized gains from its stocks.\n\nAn accounting rule requires Berkshire to report those gains with its financial results.

Anything happens to me, it will work very well the next day.\"\n\nWhat did Greg Abel or Warren Buffett say about Iowa?\n\nQuestioned about challenges to the energy industry, Abel and Buffett said tremendous amounts of money will be needed to meet growing energy demand and climate change goals.\n\nWith data centers and artificial intelligence such as ChatGP under development in Iowa, MidAmerican expects energy demand will double by the mid-2030s, Abel said.\n\n\"That will require substantial investment from MidAmerican and from shareholders\" as well as supportive regulatory policies, he said, adding that MidAmerican had already made \"substantial investments.\n\nMidAmerican received state approval last year to invest $3.9 billion to build nearly 2,100 megawatts of wind and solar energy generation. The utility says it will be at \"no net cost to consumers,\" in part because of last year's Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarked $369 billion in tax credits and other support for renewable energy generation that cuts greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nShould Berkshire Hathaway Energy companies shift to renewable energy faster?\n\nMembers of the Iowa Environmental Council and other groups protested outside the annual meeting Saturday, criticizing MidAmerican for not retiring coal plants more quickly.\n\n\"From leading the charge to gut energy efficiency programs, killing efforts to require utilities to consider the cost of new generation, and proposing to dump coal ash leachate into the Missouri River, MidAmerican constantly demonstrates that their profits are more important than their customers,\" said Kerri Johannsen, the environmental council's energy program director, said in a statement.\n\nBuffett and Abel said the move to renewable energy will take years.\n\n\"We're transitioning from carbon to renewables, but it will not happen overnight,\" Abel said, adding that so far, batteries are unable to store energy long enough to cover times when solar and wind aren't generating.\n\nAbel said in Nevada, a gas-powered plant is being built to replace two retiring coal, so that power is available \"every day, every minute.\"\n\n\"We have great examples in Iowa at times when 100% of our energy comes from wind,\" he said. \"I believe that we did that for example, on Earth Day ... but the next day, if the wind is not blowing, we need our gas plants to fill that gap.\"\n\nWhat would Warren Buffett do if granted another day with Charlie Munger?\n\nBuffett said he and Munger have enjoyed their lives.\n\n\"We were happy doing what we did every day,\" he said.\n\n\"What you should really ask yourself is, who do you feel you would want to spend the last day of your life with, and figure out how to meet them tomorrow and meet them as often as you can.\"", "source": {"uri": "desmoinesregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Des Moines Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abel", "type": "person",

And we have Tim Cook here in the audience, I believe, who has proved that and has set an example for a lot of people to follow,\" Jain said, referring to the chief executive of technology giant Apple, who succeeded Steve Jobs in 2011.\n\nJain was responding to a question from a shareholder at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday, who asked Chair Warren Buffett and Jain to talk about how the company will meet the challenge of finding a successor for Jain. Prefacing the question, the shareholder cited a comment that frequently appears in Buffett's annual letters to shareholder: If Charlie [Munger], I and Ajit are ever in a sinking boat -- and you can only save one of us -- swim to Ajit.\" (Editor's Note: Munger, who was vice chairman, died earlier this year at the age of 99.)\n\nBuffett and Jain, who heads up Berkshire's insurance and reinsurance businesses, had slightly different takes on what those businesses will be like at some point in the future when Jain is no longer at the helm, but both agreed that they will remain in excellent shape no matter who Jain's successor turns out to be.\n\nEarlier in the day, Berkshire Hathaway released first-quarter financial results for the conglomerate, revealing a 39 percent jump in operating results across the insurance and non-insurance businesses, driven largely by soaring underwriting results in the insurance and reinsurance operations. Personal auto insurer GEICO's underwriting result nearly tripled over first-quarter 2023, and underwriting income for Berkshire's reinsurance operations came in almost four-times higher than last year's first quarter.\n\nRead related article, \"Berkshire's Most Important Biz Drives Up Q1 Operating Results; GEICO Still Catching Up on Tech\" for more information about insurance and reinsurance results.\n\n\"Our board is conscious of the succession issue, not only at Warren's level but also at my level,\" said Jain, who took the role of vice chair-Insurance Operations in early 2018 when Greg Abel was also appointed as vice chair-Non-Insurance Operations. \"Every year, they [the directors] have me sitting in front of them answering questions and have me share my ideas with them in terms of what would happen to the operations if I get hit by a truck.\"\n\n\"We go through the various operations we have. I review with them a short list of people I think want to be candidates for replacing me. In addition to that I go a step further and identify a particular individual as the person I would hand over the keys to if something were to happen to me,\" Jain said.\n\n\"Obviously, that would [be] subject to change, [but] we take this issue fairly seriously,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, Tim Cook has proved to us, it would be the biggest nonissue of the day. The earth will still keep revolving around the axis,\" Jain said. (Editor's Note: Berkshire Hathaway lowered its investment stake in Tim Cook's Apple during the quarter, but the iPhone maker remained Berkshire's largest holding. Related Reuters article, \"Buffett Praises Successors, Lauds Apple Despite Lowering Stake\")\n\nBuffett had a slightly different take, agreeing, however, that the businesses currently led by Jain will not be in jeopardy when his tenure at Berkshire is over.\n\n\"We won't have the same business if Ajit isn't running it, but we'll have a very good business. And that's thanks to Ajit,\" Buffett said, recalling a story he repeats often at the annual meetings about how Jain showed up at Berkshire's office on a Saturday looking for a position to challenge his intellect.\n\n\"You've never seen an insurance policy or owned an insurance stock but here are the keys,\" Buffett recalls saying to Jain who was working in management consulting back in 1986. \"And that's worked out very well,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd been in the business [before]. I first went to GEICO in 1950. We first bought National Indemnity in 1957 and ...made quite a bit of money in the stocks of the insurance companies. But we needed Ajit\" to grow the understanding of underwriting and risk, Buffett said.\n\nLater, Buffett referred to Jain's risk management expertise again during a discussion of Berkshire's aversion to writing a lot of cyber insurance. \"You've got to have somebody in charge of things that understands that you may get an aggregation of risk that you never dreamed of -- and maybe worse than some earthquake happening someplace,\" Buffett said during the cyber discussion. (Related article, \"Berkshire Wary of \"Fashionable' Cyber Insurance, AI\")\n\nAnswering the question of Jain's succession, Buffett said, \"We won't find another Ajit, but we have an operation that he has created and...there are certain parts of it that are almost impossible for competitors to imitate. If I were in their shoes, I wouldn't try.\"\n\n\"We've institutionalized some of our advantages. [Ajit's] presence allowed us to do it,\" said Buffett noting that the structure of the insurance and reinsurance businesses at Berkshire didn't exist when Jain came in 1986.\n\n\"Nothing close to it existed with us or with anybody else. And insurance is the most important business at Berkshire,\" Buffett asserted. \"Marketable securities are important, but they're not in the [same] class exactly as our insurance business.\"\n\nLesson in Leadership\n\nAt a later point during the meeting, when another Berkshire investor asked how things have changed for leaders of individual operating companies since Jain, 72, and Abel, 61, took their vice chair roles in 2018, Jain shared a glimpse of Buffett's leadership style with the crowd assembled in Omaha, Neb., and others watching virtually on CNBC.com.\n\n\"Do the operating CEOs still reach out to Warren Buffett directly?\" asked CNBC's Becky Quick, reading the question on behalf of a shareholder.\n\nBuffett, 93, said they do not, modestly suggesting that he has little advice to offer.\n\nJain suggested another reason.\n\n\"From my perspective, the transition has worked out very, very well, but I think the credit really goes to how Warren handled the situation,\" Jain said. After the transition was announced, the operating managers were used to calling Buffett and continued to do so. Continuing to receive those calls, Buffett \"would very skillfully, in his manner, [handle] them such that he would not answer what they were looking for. But at the same time, [he] made them feel good and told them that he enjoyed hearing from them and talking to them.\"\n\nAs a result, managers \"got the message. They were very responsive to it and it's a nonissue as far as today is concerned,\" Jain reported.\n\nAbel also credited the managers in easing the transition. \"They cared deeply about Berkshire, they cared deeply about the culture and they very much wanted it to be a success,\" Abel said.\n\nBuffett insisted that the operating executives prefer to speak to Jain and Abel. \"That's understandable because I don't really do much, and I don't operate at the same level of efficiency that I would have 30 or 40 years ago. I don't know the managers as well as I would have when we were smaller and when I could get more accomplished in the day than I can now...\"\n\n\"When you've got somebody like Greg and Ajit, [then] why settle for me?\" Buffett said, going on to note that the insurance managers had gotten used to working for Jain even before he ascended to the vice chair role, and also describing the energy that Abel brings to his role -- and a toughness that neither he or Munger did.\n\nDrawing an analogy between Berkshire and the wealthy parents of 20 children, Buffett said, when \"you're very rich, you'll have some [children] that will be go-getters anyway, and you'll have some that won't.

This is lower than the $174.3 billion worth Apple stock as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, Buffett stated that the sale was for tax reasons following significant gains.\n\nMeanwhile, Buffett at the meeting added that it was extremely likely that the iPhone maker will remain Berkshire's largest holding at the end of 2024.

Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.50 per share, according to figures compiled by Thomson Reuters.

They offloaded over $17 billion of shares on a net basis.\n\nApple, Berkshire's number-one holding, made up \"substantially all of the sales,\" James Shanahan, a senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones, told Business Insider.\n\nThe stated value of Berkshire's stake fell from $174 billon at the end of December to $135 billion at the end of March, suggesting that Berkshire sold about 117 million Apple shares or 13% of its stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nBuffett confirmed the disposals during the shareholder meeting, but said he was virtually certain that Apple would still be Berkshire's top holding at the end of this year.\n\nHe appeared to rationalize the sale by noting that federal taxes are likely to rise in the years ahead as the government scrambles to service the ballooning national debt, meaning Berkshire will keep a greater share of its profits on Apple if it sells now rather than later.\n\n\"I don't think you'll mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he said.\n\nBerkshire's net stock sales totaled $24 billion in 2023, which was a big turnaround from its purchase of $34 billion of stocks on a net basis in 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, Buffett deployed $2.6 billion on stock buybacks last quarter -- Berkshire's biggest quarterly outlay since he repurchased $4.4 billion worth of the company's stock in the first quarter of last year.\n\nBerkshire spent roughly $9 billion on buybacks last year, and just under $8 billion in 2022, down from over $24 billion in both 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe parent company of See's Candies, Geico, and NetJets grew its operating income by 39% year-on-year to $11.2 billion last quarter, as strong growth in its insurance and energy divisions offset lower earnings at the BNSF Railway.\n\nAnother major highlight was Pilot Travel Centers. The truck-stop chain, which Berkshire took full ownership of early last year, grew its revenues by 32% year-on-year to $12.5 billion for the period spanning February and March.

That would mark a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshire's biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter.\n\nThis is the second quarter in a row that the Omaha-based conglomerate has trimmed the stake in the iPhone maker. It sold about 10 million Apple shares (just 1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. This filing, when accounting for the change in Apple's stock price, would imply Berkshire sold about 116 million shares.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha became a big fan of Apple after one of his investing managers Ted Weschler or Todd Combs convinced him to buy the stock. Buffett even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire's cluster of insurers.\n\nMany has speculated that the 93-year-old investing icon reduced his favorite stake due to valuation concerns. Apple's stock gained a whopping 48% in 2023 as megacap tech shares led the market rally. At its peak, Apple ballooned in Berkshire's equity portfolio, taking up 50% of it. The shares are trading at more than 27 times forward earnings.\n\nShares of the iPhone maker got a big boost in the past week after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. The shares are down more than 4% so far this year amid concerns about how it will revive growth.\n\nIt's not without precedent that the Berkshire CEO would adjust the Apple bet. He sold a bit of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2020, but Buffett admitted then that it was \"probably a mistake.\" Also it's not usual for Buffett to trim a position that has grown so large.\n\nEven with the sale, Berkshire is still Apple's largest shareholder outside of exchange-traded fund providers.", "source": {"uri": "nbcbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Bay Area"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2024/05/107410287-1714759879668-untitled-259-2-350.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Insurance investment income also swelled 32% to more than $2.5 billion.\n\nBerkshire's railroad business raked in $1.14 billion in profit, down slightly from the first quarter of 2023. Its energy division saw earnings nearly double to $717 million from $416 million a year prior.\n\nFirst-quarter net earnings, which include fluctuations from Berkshires stock investments, fell 64% to $12.7 billion. However, this is because of massive gains in Berkshire's stock portfolio as the market surged to start 2023. Buffett calls these unrealized investing gains (or losses) each quarter meaningless and misleading, but the unique conglomerate is required to report these numbers based on generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nThe company's cash hoard reached a record high of $188.99 billion, up from $167.6 billion in the fourth quarter. That massive holding, well above a CFRA Research estimate of more than $170 billion, points to Buffett's inability to find a suitable major acquisition target -- which he has lamented in recent years.\n\nThe report comes ahead the company's annual shareholder meeting, known as \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\" Buffett will answer questions from shareholders on everything ranging from the conglomerate's holdings as well as his thoughts on investing and the economy.\n\nThis will also be the first annual meeting since the death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger in November.\n\nYear to date, Berkshire Class A shares are up more than 11%, reaching an all-time high in late February.

It marks the second quarter in a row that Berkshire has dumped some of the iPhone maker's shares.\n\nDespite selling off a not-so-insignificant amount of shares, the conglomerate still owns roughly 790 million Apple shares. During a question-and-answer session Saturday during Berkshire's annual shareholder conference, Buffett said it's \"extremely likely\" that Apple remains the conglomerate's largest common stock holding.\n\n\"Unless something really extraordinary happens, we will own Apple, and American Express, and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" Buffett told investors Saturday, referring to Greg Abel, his handpicked successor.\n\nOn Sunday, an X user asked Buffett to sell all of Berkshire's Apple stock and reinvest that cash into Tesla, which has recently -- somewhat -- bounced back from a brutal few months. Musk replied to the user on the social media platform he owns, writing that \"it's an obvious move\" for the Oracle of Omaha to take a position in Tesla.\n\nTesla stock is worth $181 per share as of early Monday morning after gaining almost 1% in pre-market trading.

Anything happens to me, it will work very well the next day.\"\n\nQuestioned about challenges to the energy industry, Abel and Buffett said tremendous amounts of money will be needed to meet growing energy demand and climate change goals.\n\nWith data centers and artificial intelligence such as ChatGP under development in Iowa, MidAmerican expects energy demand will double by the mid-2030s, Abel said.\n\n\"That will require substantial investment from MidAmerican and from shareholders\" as well as supportive regulatory policies, he said, adding that MidAmerican had already made \"substantial investments.\n\nMidAmerican received state approval last year to invest $3.9 billion to build nearly 2,100 megawatts of wind and solar energy generation. The utility says it will be at \"no net cost to consumers,\" in part because of last year's Inflation Reduction Act, which earmarked $369 billion in tax credits and other support for renewable energy generation that cuts greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMembers of the Iowa Environmental Council and other groups protested outside the annual meeting Saturday, criticizing MidAmerican for not retiring coal plants more quickly.\n\n\"From leading the charge to gut energy efficiency programs, killing efforts to require utilities to consider the cost of new generation, and proposing to dump coal ash leachate into the Missouri River, MidAmerican constantly demonstrates that their profits are more important than their customers,\" said Kerri Johannsen, the environmental council's energy program director, said in a statement.\n\nBuffett and Abel said the move to renewable energy will take years.\n\n\"We're transitioning from carbon to renewables, but it will not happen overnight,\" Abel said, adding that so far, batteries are unable to store energy long enough to cover times when solar and wind aren't generating.\n\nAbel said in Nevada, a gas-powered plant is being built to replace two retiring coal, so that power is available \"every day, every minute.\"\n\n\"We have great examples in Iowa at times when 100% of our energy comes from wind,\" he said. \"I believe that we did that for example, on Earth Day ... but the next day, if the wind is not blowing, we need our gas plants to fill that gap.\"\n\nBuffett said he and Munger have enjoyed their lives.\n\n\"We were happy doing what we did every day,\" he said.\n\n\"What you should really ask yourself is, who do you feel you would want to spend the last day of your life with, and figure out how to meet them tomorrow and meet them as often as you can.\"\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

(NYSE: BRK-A) from Warren Buffett and appears to have the full backing of at least one board member ahead of the firm's annual shareholders meeting on Saturday.\n\nWhat Happened: According to a report by The Independent, Berkshire board member Ron Olson expressed confidence in Abel's capabilities to succeed Buffett.\n\nOlson lauded Abel's grasp of the core principles that have steered Buffett and his dedication to managing Berkshire conservatively to ensure the company's financial stability.\n\nOlson also believes that Abel's leadership will not deter business owners from selling their firms to Berkshire, as reported by the outlet.\n\nHe dismissed worries that the public legal dispute with the Haslam family over the final price of the Pilot truck stop chain last year would affect future transactions.\n\n\"Greg is not somebody who is going to be as likely to create the kind of following in the press that I think Warren has had,\" Olson told The Independent. \"On the other hand. I have every reason to believe that he will run the companies that we have the responsibility for in the same way that Warren ran them.\"\n\nAlso Read: Warren Buffett's Real Estate Firm Coughs Up $250M To Avoid Bigger Payout Over Commissions\n\nAbel, known for maintaining a low profile, will field questions alongside Buffett during the shareholders meeting on Saturday.

During the company's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett stated that he was \"100% comfortable\" with his decision and suggested that the transition would largely be business as usual.\n\n\"Greg understands capital allocation as well as I do.

I am sure there are loads of opportunities in countries like India.\"\n\n\"The question, however, is whether we have any advantage or insights into those businesses in India, or any contacts that will make possible transactions that Berkshire would like to participate in. That is something a more energetic management at Berkshire could pursue,\" Buffett noted.\n\nThe ace businessman also recalled his experience with another Asian nation, Japan, where the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate bought into five trading houses last year. The Japanese experience, he mentioned, has been \"fascinating enough.\"\n\nContinuing on India, Buffett then said, \"There may be an unexplored or unattended opportunity, but that may be something in the future.

There's a reason for that\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe's Airbus had established a clear sales lead over Boeing even before the American company encountered more fallout from manufacturing troubles and ongoing safety concerns. Airbus has outpaced Boeing for five straight years in plane orders and deliveries. And now Boeing is facing a government-mandated production cap on its best-selling plane. Yet aviation analysts say the European company is unlikely to extend its advantage much further despite having customers clamoring for more commercial aircraft. That's because Airbus already is making planes as fast as it can and is sold out for the rest of the decade. Manufacturing constraints at both companies are bad news for travelers as well as airlines.\n\nKim Godwin out as ABC News president after 3 years as first Black woman as network news chief\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Kim Godwin is out as ABC News president after three years as the first Black woman to lead a television network news division. The move seemed inevitable after parent Walt Disney Co. earlier this year appointed another executive, Debra O'Connell, to oversee the division. Announcing the move on Sunday, O'Connell says she'll be in charge at ABC News \"for the time being.\" Godwin was an outsider, appointed president of ABC News, after working most recently at CBS News. ABC's flagship programs, \"World News Tonight\" and \"Good Morning America,\" remain atop the network rankings, although the morning show has seen some slippage lately.\n\nCelebrating excellence in journalism and the arts, Pulitzer Prizes to be awarded Monday\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Text journalism's biggest day of the year has arrrived with the annual announcement of the Pulitzer Prizes. The Columbia University-based Pulitzer Board on Monday will reveal winners and finalists in 15 journalism categories for work done in 2023. The awards normally highlight some of the previous year's biggest stories. The ceremoney broadcast via livestream also will honor distinguished work in arts categories including books, music and theater. Columbia has been the site of student demonstrations over the war in Gaza in recent weeks, prompting the the Pulitzer Board to meet away from the New York City campus this past weekend to deliberate.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway event gives good view of Warren Buffett's successor but also raises new questions\n\nThis year's Berkshire Hathaway meeting gave shareholders their best chance yet to hear from the man who will one day take over as CEO when Warren Buffett is gone. Buffett said for the first time Saturday that Greg Abel should also take responsibility for the company's investments after he takes over, raising new questions about the succession plan. Abel put his encyclopedic knowledge of the utility business that he led directly for years on display and delved into railroad operations and potential acquisitions that Berkshire pursued while sharing the stage with Buffett all day. For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp. Observers said even if Abel is going at evaluating businesses, stock picking isn't easy.\n\nLawsuit against Meta asks if Facebook users have right to control their feeds using external tools\n\nDo social media users have the right to control what they see -- or don't see -- on their feeds? A lawsuit filed against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is arguing that a federal law often used to shield internet companies from liability also allows people to use external tools to take control of their feed -- even if that means shutting it off entirely. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Meta Platforms on behalf of an Amherst professor who wants to release a tool to let users unfollow all the content fed to them by Facebook's algorithm.\n\nWarren Buffett says AI may be better for scammers than society. And he's seen how\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett has come face to face with the downside of AI. And it looks just like him. The billionaire investing guru told tens of thousands of shareholders at his annual conference in Omaha that he recently saw an AI video of himself, complete with a perfect voiceover, giving fake advice. It was so convincing, he says, he can see how people would fall for the scam. Buffett spent all day Saturday answering shareholder questions at his first annual meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died. The absence offered shareholders the chance to hear more from the next generation of leaders who will take over after Buffett is gone.\n\nBerkshire's profit plunges 64% on portfolio holdings as Buffett sells Apple\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway says its first quarter profit plummeted on the paper value of its investments. At the same time, the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright did well. A few hours before shareholders got the chance to hear from CEO Warren Buffett at the annual meeting in Omaha, Berkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down roughly one-third from a year ago. The biggest news is that Berkshire sold off about 13% of its massive Apple stake, though the iphone maker remains Berkshire's biggest single investment and Buffett says he plans to keep it.\n\nBoeing locks out its private firefighters around Seattle over pay dispute\n\nBoeing has locked out its private force of firefighters who protect its aircraft-manufacturing plants in the Seattle area and brought in replacements after the latest round of negotiations with the firefighters' union failed to deliver an agreement on wages. The company said Saturday that it locked out about 125 firefighters and a facility about 170 miles away in central Washington. The firefighters serve as first responders to fires and medical emergencies and can call in help from local departments. Boeing says its firefighters were paid $91,000 on average last year. The International Association of Fire Fighters says they are paid far less than crews at local fire departments in the Seattle area.\n\nBrad Parscale helped Trump win in 2016 using Facebook ads. Now he's back, and an AI evangelist\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Brad Parscale was the digital campaign operative who helped engineer Trump's 2016 presidential victory with the heavy use of Facebook ads. Now Parscale is back working for Trump and is an evangelist for artificial intelligence. Parscale has a company called Campaign Nucleus that is working for Trump's campaign. He says his suite of AI-powered tools can spin up customized emails, parse oceans of data to gauge voter sentiment and find persuadable voters and amplify the social media posts of \"anti-woke\" influencers to help conservative candidates, according to an Associated Press review.\n\nNervous about falling behind the GOP, Democrats are wrestling with how to use AI\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden campaign and top Democrats are wrestling with how best to use artificial intelligence, exposing the party's anxiety over falling behind Republicans in the race to deploy technology that could transform the future of elections. Democratic strategists say they are nevertheless treading carefully in embracing tools that disinformation experts warn could pose a threat it poses to democracy. So far, they say, AI is primarily helping them find and motivate voters and to better identify and defeat disinformation.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The 'Oracle of Omaha' has spent his whole life doing what he loves, while amassing a $131.7bn personal fortune.\n\nBuffett turns 94 on 30 August, but is remarkably spry for his age. However, his right-hand man Charlie Munger's death at age 99 in November 2023 must have shaken Warren.\n\nA lifetime of going long\n\n'Uncle Warren' started investing aged 11 in 1942, investing his savings into three shares of a long-gone US business. And 82 years on, he has lost none of his sparkling enthusiasm for capitalism.\n\nToday, Warren Buffett is chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, which he and Munger grew into an $861bn conglomerate. (Disclosure: my wife and I own Berkshire B stock.) Buffett has also donated over $50bn to good causes and intends to donate 99% of his entire wealth during his lifetime or on death.\n\nHence, Buffett is one of my personal heroes, along with physicists Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking, mathematicians Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss and Srinivasa Ramanujan, and computer scientist Alan Turing.\n\nBuffett has a problem\n\nRight now, Warren has a big -- but welcome -- problem. Berkshire Hathaway is so massively profitable, it sits on a record cash pile of $168bn. Buffett has admitted that with big bargains few and far between in the US stock market, he struggles to put this cash to work.\n\nOf course, no-one but Buffett himself knows what he's thinking regarding Berkshire's cash pile. But I've learnt from reading his wisdom that, ideally, he likes his \"holding period to be forever\" and he likes to \"buy wonderful businesses at fair prices\".\n\nFor several years, I've argued that the UK's FTSE 100 index was much too low and that too many of its constituent shares were undervalued. Thus, my advice to Warren Buffett is simple: why not buy big outside of your homeland?\n\nWhat could Warren buy?\n\nTherefore, my suggestion to the world's greatest investor would be this: why not bid to buy global drinks giant Diageo (LSE: DGE)? (Another disclosure: my wife and I also own Diageo shares.)\n\nBuffett wants acquisitions that 'move the needle', delivering strong earnings and cash flow to Berkshire and its shareholders. Diageo certainly fits that bill. At the current share price of 2,723p, this firm is valued at \u00a360.4bn, making it #9 in the Footsie by market value.\n\nDiageo's shares have weakened in recent years, falling 25% in the past 12 months and losing 15.1% of their value over five years. What's more, they stand 26.3% below their 52-week high of 3,694.5p, set on 5 May 2023, and just 1.8% above their low of 2,676p, hit on 23 January. (Excluding cash dividends).\n\nSure, Diageo has a few short-term problems, notably shrinking sales in the Caribbean and Latin America. Also, the under-25s are drinking less than their older cohorts, partly driven by the legalisation of cannabis in various states and countries.\n\nThat said, if I had well over \u00a360bn at hand, I'd love to own this centuries-old business outright. Perhaps Warren Buffett -- a fellow value investor -- might one day reach this same conclusion?

The Warren Buffett-led behemoth kept the makeup of its top five holdings unchanged in the first three months of 2024, as the stock market ripped to record levels to mark the start of a new bull run. However, Berkshire did trim its Apple investment by 13% during the first quarter, marking the second straight period in which the company lowered its stake in the iPhone maker. At the end of the January-March period, Berkshire owned $135.4 billion in Apple shares , implying about 790 million shares. That said, Apple remained by far the conglomerate's largest holding. Apple has struggled this year, losing more than 4%, while the S & P 500 has soared 7.5% to record levels.

You also need to find a great stock picker who isn't a pickpocket.\n\nTo do that, you need to think less about investing and more about investment management. For Buffett, his business strategy bred a structure that set him apart from other money managers -- and made shareholders a bundle.\n\nTo see why, let's ask: How would Berkshire Hathaway have performed if Buffett had run it like a hedge fund?\n\nYes, I know you know the answer is \"worse.\" Do you realize how much worse?\n\nIf you'd invested $1,000 in the S&P 500 in early 1965 when Buffett took over at Berkshire, you'd have a bit over $300,000 today. If you'd bought Berkshire instead, you'd have more than $42.5 million -- a big reason why tens of thousands of adoring shareholders will gather in Omaha this weekend to hear Buffett hold court.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Buffett had charged hedge-fund fees, you'd have under $5 million -- still far more than the market, but about 90% less than Berkshire's actual results.\n\nPut another way, if Buffett had charged conventional hedge-fund fees, his investors would have earned only about 10% of the wealth they have enjoyed -- and he could have been even wealthier than he is today.\n\nI asked several researchers to calculate these returns independently: Andrea Frazzini, head of global stock selection at AQR Capital Management; James Carson, professor of insurance at the University of Georgia, and his former student Anthony Le; and Mila Getmansky Sherman, a finance professor at UMass Amherst, and her student Maya Peterson.\n\nWe assumed the hypothetical Berkshire hedge fund -- let's call it Berkaway LP -- charged a management fee of 2% of assets, plus a performance fee that took 20% of any gains above 6% (or, in one iteration, 8%).\n\nOver a period when the S&P 500 compounded at 10.2% annually and Berkshire at 19.8% annually, Berkaway would have returned somewhere between 13.6% and 15.9% annually.\n\nThe real Buffett nearly doubled the market's rate of return over a 59-year period; hedge-fund Buffett would also have beaten the market, but by far less.\n\nA Berkshire representative said Buffett was too busy this week to comment.\n\nIf Buffett had gone the hedge-fund route, though, I think investors would have earned less than that 13.6% to 15.9% annually. This brings us back to Berkshire Hathaway's structure.\n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Buffett ran investment partnerships that did charge hedge-fund-like fees (including a 25% cut of any annual return in excess of 6%, but no management fee).\n\nBut Buffett understood that structure should follow strategy, not the other way around. So in 1969 he announced he would close down his partnerships, and he ended up transforming Berkshire into an investment vehicle unlike any other.\n\nBecause Berkshire is a publicly traded holding company, rather than a mutual fund or hedge fund, it doesn't charge fees. And Buffett never had to worry that investors would flood him with too much money at a market top or yank it out at the bottom. Most funds have fickle capital; Berkshire has permanent capital.\n\nAlmost everywhere else in the asset-management business, investment vehicles charge fees at least partly based on a percentage of assets under management.\n\nThe bigger a fund gets, the more money the manager earns.\n\nFor clients, that's a problem for several reasons.\n\nAsset-based fees focus the managers' attention not only on increasing the fund's returns but also -- and often primarily -- on increasing the fund's size.\n\nLarger funds are cheaper to run -- but when fees are a flat percentage of assets it's the managers, not the clients, who reap those economies of scale.\n\nInstead of seeking to maximize the internal cash flows from their investments, the managers are driven to maximize the external cash flows from their investors.\n\nThat leads many managers to hype their results at the peak -- drawing in performance-chasers who fling cash at the fund just as markets are overheating and stocks are overpriced.\n\nThe managers pour the new cash into overpriced stocks that then collapse in the inevitable downturn -- at which point the hot-money customers bail out of the fund, forcing the managers to dump stocks at the bottom.\n\nThus the fund is compelled to trade in response to its investors' behavior rather than to investment opportunity: buying more when stocks are less desirable and selling when they are more desirable.\n\nThe managers, though, prosper by collecting swollen fees at peak asset levels.\n\nBuffett, meanwhile, has taken a $100,000 annual salary for more than 35 years and retains more than 216,000 shares of Berkshire's Class A stock, worth about $131 billion this week.\n\nIn theory, had Buffett run Berkshire as a hedge fund with typical fees and reinvested them all, Frazzini estimates that they would have added approximately $300 billion to Buffett's net worth by now.\n\nIn practice, that would have been impossible. Charging standard fees and having to kowtow to clients would have slashed Buffett's returns.\n\nYet most people keep ignoring Buffett's example. Institutional investors, and increasingly individual investors, have poured trillions of dollars into hedge funds, private-equity funds and other vehicles whose expenses can run as high as 6% annually.\n\nThese private funds are often structured, from the get-go, to maximize their size, rather than their rate of return.\n\nA few mutual-fund companies, including Artisan, Bridgeway, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard, have shown the courage to close funds to new investors when markets get overheated. Some hedge funds also restrict new money when they run out of opportunities.\n\nA few managers, including Orbis Investments, whose main office is in London, and Westwood Management of Dallas, offer portfolios that earn no fees at all unless they outperform their benchmark.\n\n\"It's a way of truing up the fees paid with the cumulative performance of the clients,\" says Dan Brocklebank, a senior executive at Orbis.\n\nSuch funds aren't always available to most individual investors, though -- and these fair fee arrangements remain discouragingly rare.\n\nPart of the problem is that investors should be willing to share some of the upside with fund managers, but they dislike paying higher fees for better performance. AllianceBernstein, which offered a set of funds that charged higher fees for outperformance and lower fees when returns lagged behind, had to abandon them for lack of demand.\n\nUntil investors insist that funds change their structure and fees, and more fund managers cooperate, the quest for the next Warren Buffett will remain futile.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQR_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AQR Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Management fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Georgia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strategic management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assets_under_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assets under management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rate of return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutual fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllianceBernstein", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AllianceBernstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private equity fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Vanguard Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economies of scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fidelity Investments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Rowe_Price", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

A few hours before shareholders got the chance to hear from CEO Warren Buffett at the annual meeting in Omaha, Berkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter.

The firefighters serve as first responders to fires and medical emergencies and can call in help from local departments. Boeing says its firefighters were paid $91,000 on average last year. The International Association of Fire Fighters says they are paid far less than crews at local fire departments in the Seattle area.\n\nWarren Buffett's company rejects proposals, but it faces lawsuit over how it handled one last year\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Shareholder proposals are usually uneventful at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, but Warren Buffett and the company are now facing a lawsuit over the way one presenter was treated last year. Peter Flaherty with the National Legal and Policy Center came back with another proposal this year asking Berkshire to produce a report on the risk of doing business in China after he was cut off in the middle of his presentation last year and arrested for trespassing. The charges were later dropped, but Flaherty decided to sue. He said he had never had trouble at dozens of meetings he has presented at since 2005, including Berkshire's 2022 meeting. Flaherty's proposal was one of six rejected Saturday after Berkshire and Buffett opposed them all.\n\nUS employers scaled back hiring in April. How that could let the Fed cut interest rates\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's employers pulled back on their hiring in April but still added a decent 175,000 jobs in a sign that persistently high interest rates may be starting to slow the robust U.S. job market. Last month's hiring gain was down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March. Yet the moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown last month in wage growth, will likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates at a two-decade high to fight persistently elevated inflation. Hourly wages rose a less-than-expected 0.2% from March and 3.9% from a year earlier, the smallest annual gain since June 2021.\n\nStock market today: Wall Street rallies after hiring shows welcome signs of cooling\n\nStocks closed sharply higher on Wall Street, erasing their losses for the week, after the government reported a cooldown in hiring last month. For markets that was a welcome sign that the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight inflation by slowing the economy with high interest rates might be making some progress. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% Friday, its biggest gain since February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2%. U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month, down sharply from a big increase in March. Apple jumped after announcing a mammoth $110 billion stock buyback.\n\nGoogle, Justice Department make final arguments about whether search engine is a monopoly\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and Google are making their closing arguments in a high-stakes antitrust trial to a federal judge in Washington who must now decide whether the tech giant's search engine constitutes an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department argued Friday that Google's preeminence as an internet search engine is an illegal monopoly propped up by more than $20 billion spent each year by the tech giant to lock out competition. Google argues that its ubiquity flows from its superior product and its ability to deliver consumers the results that it's looking for. A final ruling in the case is expected later this year.\n\nUS loosens some electric vehicle battery rules, potentially making more EVs eligible for tax credits\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin says new rules governing electric vehicle tax credits are a giveaway to China. Manchin, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said that exemptions in the new rules effectively endorse the idea that EVs will be \"made in China.\" The comments came as the Treasury Department loosened some rules governing EV tax credits a bit, potentially making more EVs eligible for credits of up to $7,500. The rule are aimed at juicing demand for EVs in an effort to reach a Biden administration goal that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030.\n\nApple's quarterly iPhone sales plunge 10%, but stock price surges on dividend, stock buyback news\n\nApple has posted its steepest quarterly decline in iPhone sales since the pandemic's outset. The results reflect a deepening slump that's increasing the pressure on the trendsetting company to spruce up its products with more artificial intelligence. The 10% drop in year-over-year iPhone sales for the January-March period is latest sign of weakness in a product that generates most of Apple's revenue. It marked the biggest drop in iPhone sales since July-September period in 2020 when production bottlenecks caused by factory closures during the pandemic resulted in a delayed release of the new model that year. Apple's revenue and profit still eclipsed analyst projections, and its stock rose in extended trading.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors":

Flaherty's proposal was one of six rejected Saturday after Berkshire and Buffett opposed them all.\n\nUS employers scaled back hiring in April. How that could let the Fed cut interest rates\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's employers pulled back on their hiring in April but still added a decent 175,000 jobs in a sign that persistently high interest rates may be starting to slow the robust U.S. job market. Last month's hiring gain was down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March. Yet the moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown last month in wage growth, will likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates at a two-decade high to fight persistently elevated inflation. Hourly wages rose a less-than-expected 0.2% from March and 3.9% from a year earlier, the smallest annual gain since June 2021.\n\nStock market today: Wall Street rallies after hiring shows welcome signs of cooling\n\nStocks closed sharply higher on Wall Street, erasing their losses for the week, after the government reported a cooldown in hiring last month. For markets that was a welcome sign that the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight inflation by slowing the economy with high interest rates might be making some progress. The S&P 500 rose 1.3% Friday, its biggest gain since February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. and the Nasdaq composite climbed 2%. U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month, down sharply from a big increase in March. Apple jumped after announcing a mammoth $110 billion stock buyback.\n\nGoogle, Justice Department make final arguments about whether search engine is a monopoly\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and Google are making their closing arguments in a high-stakes antitrust trial to a federal judge in Washington who must now decide whether the tech giant's search engine constitutes an illegal monopoly. The Justice Department argued Friday that Google's preeminence as an internet search engine is an illegal monopoly propped up by more than $20 billion spent each year by the tech giant to lock out competition. Google argues that its ubiquity flows from its superior product and its ability to deliver consumers the results that it's looking for. A final ruling in the case is expected later this year.\n\nUS loosens some electric vehicle battery rules, potentially making more EVs eligible for tax credits\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin says new rules governing electric vehicle tax credits are a giveaway to China. Manchin, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said that exemptions in the new rules effectively endorse the idea that EVs will be \"made in China.\" The comments came as the Treasury Department loosened some rules governing EV tax credits a bit, potentially making more EVs eligible for credits of up to $7,500. The rule are aimed at juicing demand for EVs in an effort to reach a Biden administration goal that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030.\n\nApple's quarterly iPhone sales plunge 10%, but stock price surges on dividend, stock buyback news\n\nApple has posted its steepest quarterly decline in iPhone sales since the pandemic's outset. The results reflect a deepening slump that's increasing the pressure on the trendsetting company to spruce up its products with more artificial intelligence. The 10% drop in year-over-year iPhone sales for the January-March period is latest sign of weakness in a product that generates most of Apple's revenue. It marked the biggest drop in iPhone sales since July-September period in 2020 when production bottlenecks caused by factory closures during the pandemic resulted in a delayed release of the new model that year. Apple's revenue and profit still eclipsed analyst projections, and its stock rose in extended trading.\n\nYellen says threats to democracy risk US economic growth, an indirect jab at Trump\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen argues that a fractured democracy can have destructive effects on the economy. In an address delivered Friday in Arizona, Yellen never mentioned Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump by name but hinted at his potential influence if he regains the White House. Yellen used economic data to paint a picture of how disregard for democratic institutions can bring economic harm. Yellen's remarks serve as a sort of warning for business leaders who may overlook Trump's disregard for modern democratic norms because they prefer his vision of achieving growth by slashing taxes and stripping away regulations.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press",

He noted that even after the transition, many managers would continue to call Buffett for various issues.

Airbus has outpaced Boeing for five straight years in plane orders and deliveries. And now Boeing is facing a government-mandated production cap on its best-selling plane. Yet aviation analysts say the European company is unlikely to extend its advantage much further despite having customers clamoring for more commercial aircraft. That's because Airbus already is making planes as fast as it can and is sold out for the rest of the decade.

Buffett said for the first time Saturday that Greg Abel should also take responsibility for the company's investments after he takes over, raising new questions about the succession plan. Abel put his encyclopedic knowledge of the utility business that he led directly for years on display and delved into railroad operations and potential acquisitions that Berkshire pursued while sharing the stage with Buffett all day. For his part, the 93-year-old billionaire showed investors he is still sharp.

It was so convincing, he says, he can see how people would fall for the scam. Buffett spent all day Saturday answering shareholder questions at his first annual meeting since Vice Chairman Charlie Munger died. The absence offered shareholders the chance to hear more from the next generation of leaders who will take over after Buffett is gone.\n\nBerkshire's profit plunges 64% on portfolio holdings as Buffett sells Apple\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Berkshire Hathaway says its first quarter profit plummeted on the paper value of its investments. At the same time, the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright did well. A few hours before shareholders got the chance to hear from CEO Warren Buffett at the annual meeting in Omaha, Berkshire reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down roughly one-third from a year ago. The biggest news is that Berkshire sold off about 13% of its massive Apple stake, though the iphone maker remains Berkshire's biggest single investment and Buffett says he plans to keep it.\n\nBoeing locks out its private firefighters around Seattle over pay dispute\n\nBoeing has locked out its private force of firefighters who protect its aircraft-manufacturing plants in the Seattle area and brought in replacements after the latest round of negotiations with the firefighters' union failed to deliver an agreement on wages. The company said Saturday that it locked out about 125 firefighters and a facility about 170 miles away in central Washington.

Now he's back, and an AI evangelist\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Brad Parscale was the digital campaign operative who helped engineer Trump's 2016 presidential victory with the heavy use of Facebook ads. Now Parscale is back working for Trump and is an evangelist for artificial intelligence. Parscale has a company called Campaign Nucleus that is working for Trump's campaign. He says his suite of AI-powered tools can spin up customized emails, parse oceans of data to gauge voter sentiment and find persuadable voters and amplify the social media posts of \"anti-woke\" influencers to help conservative candidates, according to an Associated Press review.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.\n\nInvestors often gauge their exposure choices based on popular fund allocations. The problem is a 60-day deadline lag between their reports and current market sentiment. The most common is the 30-day reporting lag after the end of the quarter.\n\nThis leaves plenty of room for front-running stocks, as insiders could use confidential information to game the market. It also means the fund could have already unloaded certain stocks after the last report.\n\nSuch a scenario could play out between Berkshire Hathaway and Apple, among other stocks.\n\nOn Saturday's Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder conference, Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett directly addressed the selling of ~116 million AAPL shares in Q1. This represents a 13% Apple exposure reduction, following the sale of ~10 million shares in Q4 '23, representing 1.09% of the Berkshire Hathaway stake.\n\nThis puts the total AAPL stake worth $135.4 billion to around 790 million shares, a significant cut from 905.5 million at the end of 2023, making 50.19% of the portfolio weight. Buffett hinted that the reduction was due to taxes potentially going up. Presumably, tax hikes would be used to patch up massive budgetary deficits amid sticky inflation, next to astronomical $34.7 trillion US debt.\n\n\"if I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year\"\n\nYear-to-date, AAPL shares are down 2.7%, severely lagging behind other Magnificent Seven stocks like META (up 30.5%) and AMZN (up 23.3%) for the same period. As previously covered, Apple's cancellation of its electric vehicle project and lackluster Vision Pro demand created a lack of excitement for the company.\n\nCombined with stiff smartphone competition from China and an antitrust lawsuit, it seems as if the best Apple days are in the rearview mirror. Investors could only guess what the AAPL price would be now without the heavy reliance on Apple's record-breaking stock buyback program.\n\nIn this light, Buffett may even reconsider his stance on the company, having called it one of \"Our Four Giants\" in February 2022. Back then, the Oracle of Omaha was pleased with Tim Cook's aggressive buybacks, noting that \"each 0.1% of Apple's 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million\".\n\nAlongside Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP), Apple (AAPL) remains Berkshire Hathaway's most significant stake. Buffett considers AAPL shares \"extremely likely\" to hold this status by the end of the year.\n\nMore interestingly, Berkshire reported in the Q1 earnings that cash and cash equivalents ramped significantly to $36.16 billion from $27.3 billion in a year-ago quarter. Of that, $33.67 billion in cash reserves came from the insurance sector. Further, Berkshire's cash holdings from insurance and other businesses, including U.S. Treasury equivalents ($156.2 billion), rose to $182.3 billion.\n\nAmid this quarterly 12% cash hoarding uptick, Buffett foresees cash holdings to increase to $200 billion by the end of Q2. From an investing standpoint, holding that rapidly depreciating asset would warrant allocation into currency debasement hedges, like Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin advocates often point out dilutive inflation as the main reason for gaining BTC exposure, which is up 50% YTD vs BRK.B stock at 13%.\n\nHowever, Warren Buffett remains a staunch Bitcoin opponent, saying that he wouldn't buy the entire Bitcoin supply if it were priced at $25, which now has a market cap of $1.25 trillion.\n\n\"If you ... owned all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it,\"\n\nUnlike farmlands and apartments, Buffett believes that Bitcoin \"isn't going to do anything.\" For now, he doesn't see any significant investing opportunities.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\"\n\nDo you agree with Warren Buffett's sentiment that Bitcoin has no purpose or use?

The labour market is cooling, as is wage growth, boosting hopes of a couple of rate cuts by the Fed this year. This would be a relief to investors after the timeline for, and quantum of, rate cuts have been pushed and reduced respectively from where it sat at the start of the year. The Dow Jones soared 450 points, the S&P500 had its best session since February, rallying 1.3%, and the Nasdaq leapt 2%. Shares in Apple jumped 6% following the iPhone maker's better than expected results. Oil prices declined further on signs of easing geopolitical risks in the Middle East.\n\nThe world's largest economy created 175,000 jobs in April, below estimates for 240,000. This was well down from the upwardly revised 315,000 jobs added in March. It was the first downside payrolls surprise in several months. Bond rates dropped on the report with the 10-year US Treasury briefly falling below 4.5%. Rate-sensitive stocks rose, including the Mag7.\n\nThe healthcare sector led job creation, with 56,000 additions. Overall workers holding full-time jobs soared by 949,000, while part-time workers fell by a similar number. The unemployment rate though ticked higher to 3.9%, the highest since January 2022, against expectations it would hold steady at 3.8%. A more encompassing jobless rate which includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged up to 7.4%, the highest level since November 2021.The labour force participation rate, or those actively looking for work, was unchanged at 62.7%.\n\nThe US employment market is easing up a bit, and this is also helping ease inflationary pressures as well. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% from the previous month and 3.9% from a year ago, both below consensus estimates and an encouraging sign given recent concerns around the stickiness of inflation. The US jobs market is cooling, but not too much. This provides support for the well-worn financial market cliche about a \"Goldilocks\" scenario where the economy glides to soft landing, and where growth continues but not at such a rapid pace to force the Fed to tighten policy further or hold off too long on rate cuts.\n\nThe labour market \"porridge\" for April was \"not too hot or cold\". The release comes following last week's Fed meeting where officials noted that progress on inflation had stalled but the central bank remains in data-dependent mode. This was a \"good\" piece of data for the markets, which are now pricing in a strong chance of two interest rate cuts this year, with the first in September.\n\nAdding to the prospect of the Fed bringing forward rate cuts was a release showing that the US services sector contracted in April for the first time since December 2022. The ISM Services Index fell to 49.4, down two points from March and below estimates for 52. Inventories and order backlogs also saw gains as did prices, while production, employment and new orders declined. A hot services sector has been driving the US economy, so bad economic news here is possibly good news from the market's perspective.\n\nApple shares jumped 6%. As noted on Friday the quarterly result was stronger than expected, particularly in China. The iPhone maker raised its dividend and announced a record share buyback of US$110 billion. The company gave no formal guidance on the outlook, but things appear to be picking up. The services sector posted record 14% growth - the App Store now has over 1 billion subscribers. Apple CEO Tim Cook said overall sales would grow in the \"low single digits\" during the June quarter. Apple's product line will get a boost this week with a new iPad lineup to be unveiled - the first update in nearly 1\u00bd years.\n\nApple was also a topic of discussion at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting over the weekend. Berkshire has cut its investment by about 13% to US$135 billion. Warren Buffett said the sale was for tax reasons (he thinks tax rates may be going up given US fiscal deficits) and not any judgement of his long-term view of the stock. That would be music to the ears of Apple CEO Tim Cook who sat in the front row. Even with the sale, Apple is still Berkshire's biggest holding by far. Berkshire is also still Apple's largest shareholder outside of exchange-traded fund providers.\n\nIt was the first meeting without Buffett's right hand man Charlie Munger who passed away in November. Buffett also joked about his own mortality saying \"I know a little about actuarial tables.\" He reassured investors that a plan was in place and revealed that Greg Abel, his successor, would be making the call on investment decisions. Abel has been overseeing Berkshire's energy, railroad and retail businesses. Buffett said his own investing record was not perfect, including a recent bet on media company Paramount that went south.\n\nBerkshire though continues to deliver for its shareholders (albeit not in the form of dividends as Buffett prefers share buybacks). Berkshire's first quarter operating profit rose 39% to US$11.22 billion from a year ago. Cash has climbed to a record US$188.99 billion from US$167.6 billion at December. Buffett told investors that the cash hoard could climb to US$200 billion given a lack of large attractive opportunities. He did hint though Berkshire was looking closely at an investment in Canada.\n\nBuffett said renewable energy was of interest but needed time to develop, and solar would never be the world's only electricity source. On AI he commented that he didn't particularly understand it that well, but that it could be the growth industry of all time in the way its enabled IT scamming (think deep fake and the like). He said AI has \"enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm.\"\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the STOXX50 jumped 0.6% and the FTSE100 in the UK added 0.5%. UK service sector output grew in April at its fastest pace since May 2023. The S&P Global Services PMI Business Activity Index rose to 55.0 from 53.1 in March. The composite PMI ticked up to 54.1 in April from 52.8 the month before. This marked the sixth consecutive month in positive territory and signalled the fastest expansion of private sector business activity since April 2023. The survey results are consistent with the UK economy growing at a quarterly rate of 0.4% and therefore pulling further out of last year's shallow recession. The Bank of England meets this week and is expected to remain on hold.\n\nIn Asia, Japan and Mainland China markets were closed. The Hang Seng rallied 1.5% on Friday.\n\nNo comments yet", "source": {"uri": "sharechat.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sharechat"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But there is a high level of concentration at the top, with just seven stocks accounting for approximately 84% of its total holdings as of its latest quarterly report. And these companies can tell investors a lot about Buffett's broad, long-term strategy.\n\nBuffett's top holding is Apple (AAPL 5.98%). It has long been one of his favorite stocks, with its popular products and strong customer base.\n\nBuffett loves great brands, and Apple has proved that it is among the best of the best. In the past, he's called Apple the \"best business I know in the world.\" In the trailing 12 months, the company has generated more than $100 billion in free cash flow.\n\nGiven his admiration for the stock, it's hard to imagine any other investment could take the top spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. At 40.3% of Berkshire's holdings, the iPhone and iPad maker is far and away the top position, even after a little trimming in the first quarter.\n\nAnother company that Buffett loves is Coca-Cola (he's often spotted drinking its products). Its strong brand has allowed the company to fight off the effects of inflation by passing along higher costs to consumers while still being able to generate growth.\n\nLast year, sales rose by 6%, and earnings per share were even more impressive, rising by 13%. At around 7.3%, Coca-Cola is the fourth-largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, based on its value at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe final consumer goods stock within Berkshire's top seven is Kraft Heinz. Buffett has admitted in the past that Berkshire overpaid for the stock, but like Coca-Cola and Apple, it has been a fixture amid its top holdings. At 3.6% of the portfolio's total weight, it's barely hanging on to the No. 7 spot. It has many strong brands, including Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Jell-O.\n\nIn total, these consumer products companies account for a little over 51% of Berkshire's total portfolio, highlighting the value that Buffett places on companies with strong, iconic brands.\n\nHe is also fond of financial institutions and insurance companies, viewing them as a way to bet on the long-term health of the U.S. economy -- a good move, in Buffett's eyes.\n\nThe top two financial stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are Bank of America (11.7%) and American Express (10.3%). They are the largest holdings after Apple and account for right around 22% of the portfolio's weight.\n\nBank of America, one of the nation's top banks, is in a great position to benefit from a growing economy. And while there have been concerns with regional banks in the past few years, a top bank stock such as Bank of America provides a lot of long-term stability for Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nBuffett loves credit card companies (Visa and Mastercard are in his portfolio as well), but Amex has an elevated status. Part of the reason could be that, like Apple, it caters to an affluent customer base, making it a safer option, especially amid a challenging economy.\n\nThere are also two stocks in Berkshire's top seven devoted to the oil and gas industry: Chevron (5.8%) and Occidental Petroleum (4.8%). Energy stocks can provide investors with some good returns amid inflation, and many of them -- like Chevron and Occidental -- also pay dividends.\n\nOver the past three years, these two stocks have generated market-beating returns, with Occidental surging 160% and Chevron rising by 58% -- far higher than the S&P 500's 22% gains during that time frame.\n\nFor investors worried about persistent inflation, or looking for a way to diversify, these are a couple of solid stocks within the oil and gas industry; both generate double-digit profit margins.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio has some good diversification among its top seven stocks. There are good reasons for investors to buy the same or similar stocks. Together, they can provide you with diversification, dividends, help in fighting inflation, and safety even in a challenging economy.\n\nIf you're not sure which stocks to buy, Berkshire's top seven can be a great place to start looking.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_jagielski@fool.com", "name": "David Jagielski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Cream_Cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Cream Cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Heinz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jell-O", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jell-O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Mayer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MasterCard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occidental Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Visa Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/774675/warren-buffett-with-a-group-of-people.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Buffett Gives A Convincing Reason By Benzinga", "body": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire, Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) trimmed its position in its key core holding, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a 10-Q report for the first quarter filed with the SEC on Saturday showed.\n\nParing Equity Bets: Berkshire's equity securities investment dropped from $353.84 billion in Q1 2023 to $335.86 billion in Q1 2024. Sector-wise, the firm reduced its exposure to banks, insurance and finance as well as consumer products, while upping its stakes in commercial, industrial and other stocks.\n\nThe Apple Math: Apple shares have underperformed this year, shedding 4.63% for the year-to-date period and 10.82% for the first quarter. The decline came amid fears that the company's fundamentals would deteriorate amid slow uptake of iPhones in its key China market and elsewhere.\n\nApple met modest expectations in the March quarter but reported a decline in revenue and earnings compared to the previous year. The company issued a June quarter forecast that was not as worse as feared. That said, investors are still skeptical as the company has not been very proactive with product improvements. Analysts have hinged hopes of a rebound on the launch of the AI-enabled iPhone 16 later this year and the company's late entry into the AI arena.\n\nBerkshire's $135.4 billion Apple stake in the first quarter suggests the firm may have held 744.65 million shares at the end of the first quarter. The calculation is based on Apple's average first-quarter stock price of $181.83. This is a 17.71% reduction from the 904.87 million Apple shares it held at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nThe precise number of Apple shares Berkshire holds will be known when the firm files its 13F report for the first quarter with the SEC.\n\nThis marked the second straight quarter that the firm has cut its Apple stake. In the fourth quarter, the firm lightened its Apple stake by 10 million shares.\n\nBuffett's Take: When Buffett was asked at the annual shareholder meeting whether his views of the economics of Apple's businesses or its attractiveness as investment has changed, he replied in the negative.\n\n\"Charlie [Munger] and I looked at common stocks or marketable equities...as being businesses and so when we own a Dairy Queen or whatever we own it may be, we look at it as a business,\" he said.\n\n\"We can buy really wonderful companies in the market, as businesses we can't buy all of them.\"\n\nThe billionaire said he does not attempt to predict market or pick stocks. He referred to the book \"Intelligent Investor,\" by Benjamin Graham, which clearly suggests \"if you look at stocks as businesses and treat the market as something that doesn't tell you, isn't there to instruct you, but it's there to serve you, you will do a lot better over time.\"\n\nThis is better than taking charts and listening to people talk about moving averages, he said.\n\nAlthough this approach has changed over the years with the kind of capital the company has, the basic principle was laid out, Buffett said.\n\nThe investment guru clarified this was the reason why Berkshire owns Apple, which is a better business. \"We will own, unless something extraordinary happens, we will own Apple, American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) and Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) when Greg [Abel] takes over this place,\" he said.\n\n\"We will end up unless something dramatically happens that really changes capital allocation strategy, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nUnder current conditions, he wouldn't mind at all building the cash position considering the alternative available in the equity markets\n\nApple ended Friday's session up 5.98% at $183.38, according to Benzinga Pro data. Berkshire's Class A shares fell 0.56% to $603,000.\n\nRead Next: Warren Buffett's Berkshire To Rake In $226M Passively In A Jiffy, Thanks To Its Core Holding Apple\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Final good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class A share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_Queen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Coca-Cola Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPED6Q17U_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

While he admitted difficulty predicting where automakers will stand in the next five to 10 years, he expressed greater confidence in his ability to anticipate Apple's trajectory.\n\nThis is not the first time that Musk has tried to get Berkshire Hathaway to invest in Tesla. He held meetings with Charlie Munger, Buffett's right-hand man, and recently expressed regret that Sage of Omaha didn't invest in the company when its value was 0.1% of today's.\n\nBuffett's lack of interest in Tesla is easily explainable by the recent layoffs, the slowdown in production and deliveries, and falling product prices.\n\nDespite regaining some of their lost ground in recent trading sessions, TSLA shares are still down 27.06% year over year.\n\nHowever, with the recent announcement of increased AI applications, Robotaxi, more affordable models in 2024, and FSD rollout in China, the EV maker could soon cause its TSLA stock to surge again.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro - trusted and advanced investment platform", "source": {"uri": "finbold.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finbold"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elmaz_sabovic@finbold.com", "name": "Elmaz Sabovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intrinsic value (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EToro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/05/Will-Warren-Buffett-invest-in-Tesla-stock-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

As of April 2024, Buffett, the ninth richest person in the world, saw his net worth increase by approximately 16 billion dollars in just the first five months of 2024.\n\nContentsNotable Statements from a Prominent FigureArtificial Intelligence and Berkshire Hathaway Notable Statements from a Prominent Figure\n\nAt the shareholder meeting held in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett, praised the company's growth and determination despite the death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger in November 2023. However, as the meeting progressed, comments quickly turned to artificial intelligence. During the question-and-answer session, Buffett shared the following:\n\n\"I know nothing about artificial intelligence, but that doesn't mean I deny its existence, importance, or similar matters.\"\n\nAfter this striking start, he compared the impact of AI technologies in illegal financial activities to the emergence of the atomic bomb and the spread of nuclear weapons. According to the 93-year-old billionaire, this was due to an experience where he was exposed to a deepfake product that looked, dressed, moved, and spoke just like him. The following statements were shared at the meeting:\n\nLatest technology news here: Newslinker.co\n\n\"What I mean is fraud has always been a part of the American scene but this showed me that if I were interested in investing in fraud, it would be the growing industry of all time and somehow enabled. Clearly, artificial intelligence has the potential to do good things, but looking at what I've seen recently, I don't know how I keep sending money to myself in a crazy country.\"\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Berkshire Hathaway\n\nWhile Buffett's remarks on artificial intelligence were not the first time he criticized what he sees as the frightening potential of AI, it is noteworthy that Berkshire Hathaway's largest investment holdings are in Apple, the world's second most valuable company.\n\nThe number one spot of the Cupertino company was overtaken by Microsoft, which made a significant investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, metaphorically strapping itself to a rocket ship.

Later that year, it added even more shares, ultimately becoming the largest shareholder in the company (or at least its non-voting shares, with Shari Redstone and the Redstone family's National Amusements controlling a majority of its voting shares).\n\nSince then, of course, Paramount has been on a stock downswing, as the exorbitant costs to compete in the streaming wars and a seemingly tepid M&A market, have put the company in a difficult financial position. Paramount also slashed its dividend last year so that it could invest in streaming.\n\nIn recent months the company has been embroiled in sale talks, with an exclusive negotiating window with a consortium led by David Ellison's Skydance having just ended, and a new proposal from Apollo and Sony on the table. While the stock price had picked up slightly given the talks, it has been wobbly given the uncertainty over whether a deal would get done, and what would happen if it doesn't.\n\nThe company also parted ways with its CEO, Bob Bakish, last week, replacing him with a trio of executives forming an \"office of the CEO.\"\n\nAt Berkshire's shareholder meeting last year in Omaha, Buffett quipped that \"it's not good news when any company cuts its dividend dramatically,\" and added comments that seemed skeptical of the streaming business.\n\n\"You've got a bunch of companies that don't want to quit. Who knows what pricing does under that?\" Buffett said.\n\nAt Saturday's meeting, Buffett said that the experience taught him, at 93 years old, a lesson.\n\n\"Actually, owning Paramount made me think even deeper, but I certainly looked harder about the whole question of what people do with their leisure time and what the governing principles are of running an entertainment business of any sort, whether it's sports or movies or whatever it might be,\" Buffett said. \"I think I'm smarter now than I was a couple years ago, but I also think I'm poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the matter I did.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It's the investing legend's first without his right-hand man Charlie Munger, who passed away on November 28, 2023, just shy of his 100th birthday.\n\nWhile Munger's absence is significant, his presence loomed throughout the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nCharlie Munger's name was among the first words uttered by Buffett as he took the stage.\n\nBuffett described Munger as the \"architect of Berkshire\", and his request to shareholders to \"join me in applauding Charlie\" was met with cheers and a standing ovation by a crowd that included the likes of Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Frasier and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.\n\n\"In terms of having a partner, I simply cannot think of a conversation I had with Charlie that he misled me,\" Buffett later told the packed house.\n\nBuffett added: \"In terms of managing money, there wasn't anybody better in the world to talk to for many, many decades than Charlie.\"\n\nThe meeting started with a video tribute to the former Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which included a number of Munger's famous one-liners from prior meetings, including \"I think that, every time you saw the word EBITDA, you should substitute the word \"bulls**t\" earnings.\"\n\nEBITDA is more formally known on the Street as shorthand for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Companies tend to hype the metric as a purer read on the health of the business rather than net profits.\n\n\"It's a bittersweet moment... a tough day for a lot of people,\" new Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me of Munger's absence.\n\nSheridan's message was echoed by executives of other Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nDairy Queen Executive Vice President Maria Hokanson described it as \"an air of gratitude\" and \"a moment for us to reflect and celebrate his character and his wisdom.\" Meanwhile, long-time See's Candies CEO Pat Egan noted that Munger's investment influence is evident in how Berkshire's businesses operate.\n\n\"He's still here in many ways... It's about simplicity, doing the right thing, not overthinking things and taking care of the customer,\" Egan said to me.\n\nEgan added: \"You can't replace Charlie Munger. He's just an incredible, incredible presence and he's missed.\"\n\nAs the meeting got underway, Buffett misspoke and called his successor Greg Abel \"Charlie\" when asking him to weigh in on a shareholder's question. His mistake was met with cheers from the audience.\n\nBuffett was also quick to highlight Munger's influence on Berkshire's portfolio, telling shareholders BYD (BYDDY) and Costco (COST) were the two stocks Munger advocated for the most.\n\n\"Charlie in all those years, only two times said \"buy, buy, buy.\" BYD was one of them and Costco was the other. Looking back, I should have been more aggressive in Costco. He was right, big time, in both companies.\"\n\nBuffett and Munger's unique and special partnership was evident when the Oracle of Omaha was asked what he would do if he could have one more day with Charlie.\n\n\"Charlie liked learning. He liked a wide variety of things... We had as much fun, perhaps even more fun, with things that failed because then we really had to work out a way out of them,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"It's an interesting question,\" Buffett added. \"We never had any doubts about the other person, period... Charlie always said 'just tell me where I'm going to die so I'll never go there.' The truth is, he went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99 but the world was interested in him.

For the first time since the company was founded, the meeting took place without Buffett's right-hand man and vice president Charlie Munger. The latter passed away in November last year at the age of 99.\n\nMunger was and Buffett remains a persistent critic of Bitcoin, claiming that BTC is going nowhere. Once Buffett even referred to it as \"rat poison squared.\" However, last year, the primary cryptocurrency amazed the financial world by surpassing Berkshire Hathaway by the size of its market capitalization and leaving it far behind.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Buffett company's market cap stands at 862.05 billion, while Bitcoin already boasts $1,245,020,193,429.\n\nSaylor tweeted that he only hope he sees for the company legendary to the investment world is Bitcoin.\n\nIn his tweet, Saylor hints that Warren Buffett should consider following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy. This company has been steadily buying BTC since the August of 2020.\n\nIn April, the company purchased another 122 BTC lump with $7.8 million. This increased its overall holdings to 214,400 BTC evaluated at a whopping $13.22 billion on the balance sheet. Thanks to Bitcoin and the money raised from shareholders to buy more of it, MicroStrategy's market capitalization now holds at $21.57 billion.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has managed to stage a recovery of almost 7% as it suddenly rose from the $59,000 price tag to $63,190 where it is changing hands as of this writing.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Saylor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael J.

Will Oracle Of Omaha Bet On Tesla? By Benzinga", "body": "Will Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) full self-driving technology pose a risk to the prospects of one of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.'s (NYSE:BRKA) (NYSE:BRKB) portfolio companies? Billionaire investor Warren Buffett was asked this question at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.\n\nTesla A Risk To GEICO? An investor in both Elon Musk's Tesla and Berkshire posed a question to Buffett: If Musk succeeds in reducing accidents by 50% compared to human drivers with Full Self-Driving (FSD), wouldn't auto insurance rates decrease to reflect the reduced underwriting risk? The investor also asked the investment guru whether this would affect GEICO's revenues, float and margins.\n\nIn response, Buffett stated that if accident rates decrease, the data will reflect it, and consequently, prices will come down.\n\n\"There have been a lot of people talk about doing that in the past. I mean General Motors used to be very big in the insurance business and when Uber first started, they used some firm, which now is, I think, confirmed they're close to bankruptcy ... because of taking things out at the wrong prices,\" he said.\n\nThe billionaire said a 50% reduction in accidents is good for society and would be bad for the insurance company's volume.\n\n\"But you know, good for society is what we're looking for,\" he said.\n\nBuffett pointed out that the number of people killed per 100 million passenger miles driven has declined from 15 during his youth to approximately seven after World War II. It has since fallen substantially to around two, Buffett said, giving credit to political activist Ralph Nader, who crusaded for auto safety.\n\nAt that point, Ajit Jain, vice chairman of insurance operations, asserted that Tesla's belief that the number of accidents will decrease is certainly demonstrable.\n\n\"What needs to be factored in as well is the repair cost of each one of these accidents has skyrocketed,\" he said.\n\n\"If you multiply the number of accidents times the cost of each accident, I'm not sure that total number has come down as much as Tesla would like us to believe.\"\n\nJain also remarked that Tesla has been considering the possibility of offering insurance directly or indirectly, but thus far, it hasn't experienced significant success.\n\n\"I think ... automation just shifts a lot of the expense from the operator to the equipment provider,\" he said.\n\nOpportunities In EV Space: Buffett was also asked about potential opportunities in the zero-emission vehicles space, as these vehicles have finally reached the cusp of massive adoption.\n\nHe said that massive adoption has been a moving target so far.\n\n\"I hope we get there,\" he said, adding that he didn't believe Berkshire brought any special expertise to that field. He noted that vehicle manufacturers were better suited for such endeavors.\n\n\"I would certainly not know how to pick the winners in an industry like that, but I'll be delighted if there are some winners, but don't count on us for seeing who the winners will be and don't count on us for predicting when something will happen,\" Buffett said.\n\nRead Next: 'Charlie And I:' Warren Buffett Reminisces About Late Friend, Whom He Credits As 'Architect Of Today's Berkshire'\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GEICO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Autopilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Nader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEC602U7_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

I was late, as far as several hundred people were concerned. The folks I talked to at the front of the line had been there since 2 a.m.\n\nSuch is the scene every year at the shareholders meeting at Berkshire Hathaway, the $826 billion conglomerate helmed by the Oracle of Omaha himself, Warren Buffett. By the time the doors opened at 7 a.m., shareholders queued up by the tens of thousands, some in sensible outerwear, others clinging to the free coffee provided by the Pilot chain of truck stops -- a Berkshire subsidiary.\n\nEach year Buffett spends hours taking questions from shareholders, answering each at length with his trademark mix of razor sharp investing acumen and warm, Midwestern wit. CNBC covers every word he says, and we financial journalists tune in along with investors the world over, hoping to glean some wisdom from the legendary investor.\n\nAs I roamed the streets outside the arena on Saturday, I began to wonder why some of these people flew halfway around the world and showed up as early as 2 a.m. in the cold to see an event that they could catch in crystal clear 4K at home.\n\nSo I asked. Here's what they said, edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nJames F. Eddins, Fairhope, Alabama: When you're live and you're here, you get to see them in their element. And you get to experience the whole thing just like this -- standing here and meeting people every year, and sometimes year after year. And you make a lot of friends here with the same mindset: They wanna learn from the best investor of all time.\n\nWalter Chang, Taipei, Taiwan: I love coming here and seeing them in person, and it's like going to a lecture and getting the Graham and Dodd value investing, and also buying a business at a fair price. [I try to come] every year, and it's amazing to see Warren and Charlie in this meeting.\n\nMatt McAllister, Fairhope, Alabama: Omaha's a great place. The people are a lot of fun. I think you absorb the material of the meeting very differently in person that you do watching it on a screen at home.\n\nJason Garner, Oakville, Canada: I think the biggest thing that comes to mind is the people that all come, that you meet in line, that you meet in the bars after. That's what really makes the difference. Because of course you could just watch the stream. I think just like in-person work, it's the same thing. You're able to pick up on some more smaller details when you're here in person.\n\nJames Hunt, South Africa: It's the human-to-human connection with people just like this. It's fun being together.\n\nNathan Prottsman, Omaha, Nebraska: It's just a big event here in Omaha. And it's always worth seeing. We're gonna miss Charlie [Munger] this year. But just when they communicate, they summarize micro- and macroeconomics in a way that's just very understandable. And their conservative views on investing -- it just draws a lot of people and it's just fun to be a part of this and be here.\n\nBarbara Govan, Houston, Texas: I wanted to have the actual experience. And I wanted to come, since I had missed coming when Charlie Munger was alive. And I wanted to see Warren Buffett in person.\n\nYuan Fang, Dublin, Ireland: We come with the whole family. Warren Buffett is the guy who changed our life. When my husband was in college, he stuck to Warren Buffett's methods and stuck to it his whole life. Then we had our fund company and achieved something. So we appreciate what Warren Buffett brought us.\n\nTom Keady, New Market, Maryland: It's more of an immersive experience. [My son] is just 11 years old. In the classroom you're not getting that kind of immersive experience. We can sit behind a computer like he did through the pandemic. Or you can come here, see Warren Buffett in person, and just enjoy the conference. That's really the point here.\n\nGiuliano Guarino, Milan, Italy: It's completely different. You can feel it. You're part of a community when you come here. The feeling is always the same -- like-minded people. It's like being in a church, to be honest. I want [my children] to be exposed to all of these things from a very early stage. They're small shareholders of Berkshire. It's fantastic coming with the family.\n\nEleanor Abney, Hayden & Parker McIntosh, ages 9-12, Louisville, Kentucky: It's a special learning experience for us.\n\nI think it's exciting, because you get to stand two hours in the cold -- that's really fun.\n\nIt's really fun -- you get to hear people in person. Sometimes you get to meet famous people, too. And we got to see Charlie Munger actually talk before he died.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

During the shareholders meeting held in Omaha, Nebraska he lauded the company's growth and perseverance despite the November 2023 death of vice chairman Charlie Munger.\n\nHowever, the commentary quickly turned to AI as the meeting wore on. Speaking during a Q&A session, Buffett said \"I don't know anything about AI but that doesn't mean I deny its existence or importance or anything of the sort.\"\n\nAfter this auspicious start, he compared the impact of AI technologies in illicit financial activities to the advent of the atomic bomb and the proliferation of nuclear weaponry.\n\nThis, as the 93-year-old billionaire related it, stemmed from an experience he had wherein he was exposed to a deepfake doppelganger that looked, dressed, moved, and talked exactly like himself.\n\nPer a transcript of the meeting:\n\nWhile this isn't the first time that Buffett has decried what he sees as the scary potential of AI, it's notable that Berkshire Hathaway's largest investment holdings lie in the world's second most valuable company, Apple.\n\nThe Cupertino company's number one spot was usurped by Microsoft who metaphorically strapped itself to a rocketship when it invested heavily in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nIn the time since, it's appeared as though Apple has been playing catch up.

But there is a high level of concentration at the top, with just seven stocks accounting for approximately 84% of its total holdings as of its latest quarterly report. And these companies can tell investors a lot about Buffett's broad, long-term strategy.\n\nBuffett's top holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). It has long been one of his favorite stocks, with its popular products and strong customer base.\n\nBuffett loves great brands, and Apple has proved that it is among the best of the best. In the past, he's called Apple the \"best business I know in the world.\" In the trailing 12 months, the company has generated more than $100 billion in free cash flow.\n\nGiven his admiration for the stock, it's hard to imagine any other investment could take the top spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. At 40.3% of Berkshire's holdings, the iPhone and iPad maker is far and away the top position, even after a little trimming in the first quarter.\n\nAnother company that Buffett loves is Coca-Cola (he's often spotted drinking its products). Its strong brand has allowed the company to fight off the effects of inflation by passing along higher costs to consumers while still being able to generate growth.\n\nLast year, sales rose by 6%, and earnings per share were even more impressive, rising by 13%. At around 7.3%, Coca-Cola is the fourth-largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, based on its value at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe final consumer goods stock within Berkshire's top seven is Kraft Heinz. Buffett has admitted in the past that Berkshire overpaid for the stock, but like Coca-Cola and Apple, it has been a fixture amid its top holdings. At 3.6% of the portfolio's total weight, it's barely hanging on to the No. 7 spot. It has many strong brands, including Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Jell-O.\n\nIn total, these consumer products companies account for a little over 51% of Berkshire's total portfolio, highlighting the value that Buffett places on companies with strong, iconic brands.\n\nHe is also fond of financial institutions and insurance companies, viewing them as a way to bet on the long-term health of the U.S. economy -- a good move, in Buffett's eyes.\n\nThe top two financial stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are Bank of America (11.7%) and American Express (10.3%). They are the largest holdings after Apple and account for right around 22% of the portfolio's weight.\n\nBank of America, one of the nation's top banks, is in a great position to benefit from a growing economy. And while there have been concerns with regional banks in the past few years, a top bank stock such as Bank of America provides a lot of long-term stability for Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nBuffett loves credit card companies (Visa and Mastercard are in his portfolio as well), but Amex has an elevated status. Part of the reason could be that, like Apple, it caters to an affluent customer base, making it a safer option, especially amid a challenging economy.\n\nThere are also two stocks in Berkshire's top seven devoted to the oil and gas industry: Chevron (5.8%) and Occidental Petroleum (4.8%). Energy stocks can provide investors with some good returns amid inflation, and many of them -- like Chevron and Occidental -- also pay dividends.\n\nOver the past three years, these two stocks have generated market-beating returns, with Occidental surging 160% and Chevron rising by 58% -- far higher than the S&P 500's 22% gains during that time frame.\n\nFor investors worried about persistent inflation, or looking for a way to diversify, these are a couple of solid stocks within the oil and gas industry; both generate double-digit profit margins.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio has some good diversification among its top seven stocks. There are good reasons for investors to buy the same or similar stocks. Together, they can provide you with diversification, dividends, help in fighting inflation, and safety even in a challenging economy.\n\nIf you're not sure which stocks to buy, Berkshire's top seven can be a great place to start looking.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

When asked whether his view on Apple had changed, the Oracle of Omaha told shareholders that he thought Apple is an even better business than American Express (AXP) and Coca Cola (KO), two of Berkshire's other large holdings.\n\nBuffett's remarks helped alleviate investors' concerns that Berkshire was reducing exposure to Apple over valuation concerns following its 48% gain in 2023 and forward earnings multiple of 28 times. Still, the stock may face short-term price fluctuations as investors digest Berkshire's latest sales in the stock.\n\nApple shares have oscillated roughly within a 30-point trading range since August 2023, with the price testing the pattern's upper and lower levels several times over the past eight months. More recently, the stock gapped above the 200-day moving average on Friday after posting a better-than-expected earnings report.\n\nIf the shares continue to see follow-through buying, investors should monitor the $196 level, an area on the chart where the price may encounter overhead resistance from the range's top trendline. However, during periods of weakness, watch for a potential gap fill down to around $173, which sits in close proximity to the 50-day moving average.\n\nApple shares were down 0.5% at $182.42 at around 7:00 a.m. ET. Through Friday's close, the stock had lost about 5% since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

By Benzinga", "body": "Benzinga - by Piero Cingari, Benzinga Staff Writer.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK)(NYSE:BRK) significantly reduced its holdings in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), cutting its stake by 22% to $135.4 billion from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, as reported in a recent SEC 10-Q filing.\n\nThis adjustment occurred despite Apple's share price only dropping 11% during the same period, reflecting a substantial sale of about 115 million shares, or 13% of Berkshire's total holdings in the tech giant.\n\nBerkshire's Strategic Shifts Amid Market Dynamics The sale marked the second consecutive quarter in which the Omaha-based conglomerate trimmed its stake in Apple. The reduction in holdings aligned with an overall cautious approach in the stock market, although Apple shares experienced a decline of 4.63% year-to-date.\n\nDespite these reductions, Buffett reassured investors at Berkshire's annual meeting that Apple was likely to remain the company's largest investment barring significant capital allocation changes.\n\nThe proceeds from selling Apple stock have significantly bolstered Berkshire Hathaway's cash reserves, expected to exceed $200 billion by June, positioning Warren Buffett favorably for potential market downturns.\n\nLatest Price Actions And Technical Analysis On Apple\n\nApple was proactive in countering market downturns by announcing a massive $110 billion share repurchase program, the largest ever done in the U.S. stock market.\n\nThis strategic move helped Apple's stock rebound strongly, with a 6% rally last Friday, marking its best performance since November 2022.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Apple showed signs of a potential market turnaround, having recently surpassed its 200-day moving average.\n\nFurthermore, Apple's share price recently cleared the 50% Fibonacci retracement mark from its December 2023 highs to April 2024 lows, pointing towards a possible reversal of the recent bearish trend.\n\nDespite the sizeable sell-off from one of its most steadfast investors, Apple remains a key player in Berkshire's portfolio, and the broader market's response to its latest actions indicates resilience in its stock.\n\nRead Now: Apple's Largest iPhone Manufacturer Reports Its Best-Ever April Revenue Amid 'Stronger' iPhone Demand\n\nPhotos: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_retracement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fibonacci retracement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moving average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEJ55021_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Within Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of publicly traded stocks, just 10 positions comprise more than 90% of its invested capital.\n\nOne of those positions is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Buffett and Berkshire are betting on this company in a far greater way than most investors realize.\n\nAccording to the most recent filings, Berkshire's publicly traded portfolio is worth around $350 billion. It's important to note that this is just a piece of Berkshire's total asset base. It has, for example, complete ownership over dozens of additional businesses whose value is not included in this figure. Still, this $350 billion portfolio is a great way to see what Buffett and his investment team are backing.\n\nOccidental Petroleum is currently the sixth largest position in this portfolio, just behind Chevron, another oil and gas producer. Berkshire owns around 250 million shares of Occidental Petroleum worth around $14 billion in total. Note that Occidental Petroleum has a market cap of around $60 billion, meaning Berkshire owns roughly one-quarter of the entire company.\n\nBerkshire first bought shares in the first quarter of 2022. At the time, Occidental Petroleum shares traded between $20 and $30 per share. Today, the share price is above $60. Still, Berkshire remains heavily invested, with no share sales reported last quarter.\n\nOccidental Petroleum and Chevron are the only oil and gas stocks Buffett owns in this portfolio, but in combination, they represent roughly 10% of the portfolio's total value. It's clear that someone at Berkshire, maybe even Buffett himself, loves Occidental Petroleum stock.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

Not being able to have a worst case cap on it is what scares us,\" he said.\n\nSo far, he admitted, losses have been \"fairly well contained. Out of 100 cents on the dollar of premium, losses over the last four or five years...have not been beyond 40 cents on the dollar leaving a decent profit margin. But having said that, there's not enough data to be able to hang your hat on and say what your true loss cost is.\"\n\nAdvising the people running Berkshire's insurance operations, he said that while he discourages them from writing cyber insurance at all, \"to the extent they need to write it so as to satisfy certain client needs, I have told them no matter how much you charge you should tell yourself that each time you write a cyber insurance policy you're losing money. We can argue about how much money you're losing but the mindset should be you're not making money on it...\"\n\nHe continued, \"My guess is at some point it might become a huge business but it might be associated with huge losses. Our approach is to stay away from it right now until we can have access to some meaningful data and can hang our hat on data.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's Chairman Warren Buffett interjected. \"You have just heard why Ajit is invaluable -- because when you insure something you really want to think of how much can you lose.\" (Related article: \"Jain Successor Is Recurring Berkshire Board Topic; Leadership Lessons from Warren Buffett\")\n\nDrawing an analogy between riot insurance losses in the wake of assassinations of political figures in the 1960s, Buffett explained that said having a policy limit was slim protection for carriers. \"If somebody is assassinated in some town, and that causes losses of thousands of businesses all over the country, if you've written all those thousands of policies, do you have one event or do you have 1,000 events?\n\n\"There's no place where that kind of a dilemma enters into more than cyber,\" he said.\n\nA carrier may feel comfortable writing $10 million dollars of limit per risk, but \"if that one event turns out to effect a thousand policies, and somehow they're all linked together in some way, and the courts decide that way, [then] you have written something that there's no way [you're] getting the proper price for -- and it could break the company,\" he said.\n\n\"People want to be in anything that's fashionable when they write insurance. And cyber is an easy [issuance.] Agents like it. They're getting a commission on every policy they write,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"You've got to have somebody in charge of things that understands that you may get an aggregation of risk that you never dreamed of [that] may be worse than some earthquake happening someplace.\"\n\n\"Human nature is such that most insurance companies will get very excited-and their agents will get very excited. And it's very fashionable. And as Charlie [Munger] would say, it may be rat poison,\" Buffett said, eluding to the frank statements that Berkshire Hathaway's former vice chairman has made about similar ideas. Editor's Note: Munger died earlier this year at the age of 99.)\n\nAI Scamming: The Next Growth Industry\n\nDuring the annual meeting, Buffett was asked several times to share thoughts the impacts of artificial intelligence on business and society. With Munger-like directness, Buffett admitted he didn't have a good understanding of AI but drew analogies to the handling of nuclear weapons in describing the potential risks.\n\nAt one point, he said had recently seen an AI version of himself that he felt was realistic enough to scam anyone who knew him.\n\n\"Scamming has always been part of the American scene but this would make me -if I was interested in investing in scamming, it's going be the growth industry of all time....\n\n\"Obviously AI has potential for good things too but....based on the one I saw recently, I practically would send money to myself over in some crazy country,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't have any advice on how the world handles it because I don't think we know how to handle what we did with the nuclear genie. But I do think as someone who doesn't understand a damn thing about it that it is it has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm. I just don't know how that plays out,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "carriermanagement.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carrier Management"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEICO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "GEICO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinsurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reinsurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.carriermanagement.com/assets/AdobeStock_648772965-AI-Generated-Warren-Buffett-cropped.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538966", "eventUri": "eng-9538966", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

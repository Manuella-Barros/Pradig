{"id": 225056458, "title": "Reps Stepped Down Amendment Seeking Foreign Intervention In Nigeria's Insecurity", "text": "The Nigeria\u2019s Federal House of Representatives on Wednesday retracted a contentious amendment, seeking foreign intervention to address Nigeria\u2019s insecurity issues. The motion, which ignited a heated debate in the green chamber has been a focal point of controversy among lawmakers This was as some members of the green chamber vehemently declined an amendment to the motion addressing nationwide insecurity that proposed inviting foreign mercenaries to assist in combating the issue. Hon. Ahmed Jaha\u2019s amendment followed a motion presented on the House floor during the plenary session on Wednesday. Jaha stated that despite ongoing efforts by security agencies over the years, results have been insufficient. Therefore, he emphasized the need for Nigeria to engage foreign contractors to assist in combating insecurity across the country. \u201cDuring the period of insecurity in the northeast between 2020, there was no significant hunger in the country. However, when the bandits realized that their actions were causing more hunger than insecurity, they expanded their operations to the southeast and southwest.\u201d \u201cGiven the insurgency we\u2019re grappling with, it\u2019s prudent to seek assistance from other nations. Nigeria lacks the power and influence of countries like Ukraine and Russia. Bringing in machinery to tackle insecurity is essential to prevent a worsening hunger crisis next year. The current strategy of targeting farmers is crippling agricultural productivity. While we appreciate the efforts of our security agencies, additional support is urgently needed.\u201d \u201cWe owe it to our constituents to be transparent and provide them with the truth, enabling us to effectively communicate with them.\u201d Also debating on the motion, Hon. Abbas Adigun emphasized the urgent need to prioritize the welfare of security officers and provide necessary support to boost their performance. He strongly opposed the suggestion of employing foreign mercenaries, stating that it would be a source of embarrassment for the nation. We must prioritize bolstering the capacity of our security agencies and ensuring the welfare of their personnel. When they bravely venture into the field, there\u2019s a stark reality: a 50% chance they won\u2019t return. We must also consider the welfare of their families left behind.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re sorely lacking the modern equipment needed to confront insurgents effectively. Despite discussing security measures in the 9th Assembly, no tangible actions have been taken. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve chosen not to attend any security meetings in this assembly.\u201d \u201cRequesting another nation to supply us with machinery is a slight to our stature as a leading African nation. We possess the capability within our security agencies, augmented by the expertise of retired service chiefs, to undertake such tasks internally.\u201d \u201cMany of Nigeria\u2019s security challenges stem from its poorest and least educated regions. These issues are the fruit of seeds planted long ago. Nigeria must prioritize investments in education and alternative livelihoods over criminal activities.\u201d \u201cThe Minority Leader of the House, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, is adamant that the resolutions passed regarding insecurity must be implemented promptly. He believes this action will effectively address the concerns raised.\u201d \u201cDespite differences in tongues and tribes, and even among political parties, we are united in this chamber by our acknowledgment of a pressing issue: insecurity. Let\u2019s rephrase and refine this write-up to emphasize our collective concern and commitment to addressing the problem effectively.\u201d \u201cWe committed to consolidating and addressing all security-related resolutions made in this chamber, yet to date, no action has been taken. A significant issue is food insecurity; hungry people cannot be expected to function normally. Without decisive action, this discussion will yield no positive outcomes.\u201d The House adopted the motion, resolving for its leadership to engage in further discussions with the President regarding insecurity concerns. Additionally, the House resolved to allocate funds to the Police for the reconstruction of security infrastructures damaged by insurgents.\u201d", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"593\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-29-at-15.21.50.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-29-at-15.21.50.jpeg 593w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-29-at-15.21.50-300x196.jpeg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-29-at-15.21.50-210x136.jpeg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" /></div>The Nigeria&#8217;s Federal House of Representatives on Wednesday retracted a contentious amendment, seeking foreign intervention to address Nigeria&#8217;s insecurity issues.

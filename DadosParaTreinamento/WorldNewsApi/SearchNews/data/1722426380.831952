{"id": 243352270, "title": "In battle for eyeballs, Netflix boosts Southeast Asian content in bid to fend off local rivals", "text": "An increase in local content has helped Netflix strengthen its market share in Southeast Asia, but experts say the world\u2019s largest streaming TV service still faces fierce competition from local rivals focused on Korean and Chinese dramas. \u201cLocal content plays an important role in subscriber acquisition in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia and Thailand, two of Netflix\u2019s focus markets for local content production, alongside the Philippines,\u201d said Dhivya T, lead analyst at Media Partners Asia (MPA), which provides insights and advice to media companies in the Asia-Pacific. According to ampd research, MPA\u2019s research arm, 11 per cent and 21 per cent of Netflix viewers became subscribers in Indonesia and Thailand, respectively, between January 2023 to March this year through first watching their local content offerings. Netflix has also benefited from its US streaming rivals back-pedalling from Southeast Asia. Disney+, which raised subscription prices in the region last year, is no longer focused on original content creation. Neither is Amazon\u2019s Prime Video due to shareholders\u2019 demand of profitability over subscriber growth. At an event in Jakarta earlier this month, Netflix highlighted its new and coming series and feature films from regional creators, which include acclaimed Indonesian director Joko Anwar\u2019s Nightmares and Daydreams, the country\u2019s first sci-fi series. \u201cWe want to make sure that we bring locally authentic stories to our members in each of these countries. That\u2019s why we have our teams on the ground, communicating with local creators on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Minyoung Kim, vice-president of content at Netflix in Asia-Pacific except India, said at the June 13 event. Joko\u2019s series, which premiered on June 14, went on to become the platform\u2019s fourth most watched non-English language programme globally, gaining 2.1 million views as of Thursday. The show has also earned praise from Indonesian viewers, who often favour Korean dramas, Chinese series, or Japanese anime over locally produced content. \u201cIt\u2019s not often for me to binge-watch Indonesian series, let alone a sci-fi one. Joko Anwar\u2019s Nightmares and Daydreams is an exquisite, mind-blowing masterpiece,\u201d user Ola wrote on X. Hikmat Darmawan, an Indonesian film industry observer and producer at Jakarta-based production house Imaginarium Pictures, said \u201cit\u2019s only natural\u201d that Nightmares and Daydreams was popular with Indonesian audiences due to its high production values. \u201cNetflix\u2019s content has the latest production standards. This has an impact because there is a transfer of technology and a transfer of knowledge to Indonesian filmmakers. \u201cJoko Anwar is also a proven brand, it\u2019s natural that his TV show is popular,\u201d he said. Beating K-dramas? Netflix entered Southeast Asia in 2016 and remains committed to commissioning content in the region, including Indonesia, amid a push in Hollywood to find new growth markets in Asia, according to Hikmat. \u201cThere have also been many strikes in Hollywood from the workforce there, especially writers and actors. A lot of production was hampered, and when production is forced, the results are bad. Market saturation can be seen in Marvel products,\u201d he noted. Marvel Studios\u2019 2023 release of The Marvels was its worst-performing film to date, with a box-office run of only US$205 million worldwide. Deadpool & Wolverine is the only Marvel film slated for this year. Southeast Asian producers are also competing for eyeballs with Korean and Chinese content, which still rules streaming platforms in the region. According to MPA\u2019s report, K-dramas were the most popular content among Asian viewers on streaming platforms between January 2023 to March this year, with over 40 per cent of engagement, followed by Japanese anime at 18 per cent and Chinese dramas at 9 per cent. Indonesian and Thai-produced content each earned 3 per cent engagement. Getting as much Korean content as possible has been the playbook for local and regional streamers such as Hong Kong\u2019s Viu and Jakarta-based Vidio, which also focuses on sports and dramas, according to Hikmat. \u201cViu and Vidio are focused on the K-pop fan market. When dealing with Indonesian production houses, they would say, \u2018your content is not Korean enough\u2019. Netflix doesn\u2019t operate like that,\u201d he said. \u201cNetflix is willing to pay for high-quality local productions, but it\u2019s very selective. So, on one hand, Netflix has boosted the value of our movie industry, but it\u2019s only enjoyed by a handful of elite [filmmakers]. Netflix does not want to take risks with new directors.\u201d That playbook seems to be working. In Southeast Asia, Netflix leads the region across subscribers and monetisation, accounting for 49 per cent of the streaming sector\u2019s total subscription revenue, according to the MPA report. The platform also surpassed 10 million subscribers at the end of the first quarter of this year, pulling ahead of local and regional competitors such as Viu, Disney+ Hotstar, Vidio, WeTV and Amazon Prime Video, the report added. Dhivya noted that Vidio leads over Netflix in terms of subscribers in Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest economy, with a market share of 20 per cent, 9 per cent bigger than Netflix\u2019s. \u201cHowever, those subscriptions have very different average revenue per user, of US$5 to US$6 for Netflix and US$2.50 for Vidio,\u201d she said, adding that viewers also spent more hours on Netflix compared with Vidio and Viu. According to MPA\u2019s report, paid subscriptions to premium video-on-demand services in Southeast Asia reached 48.5 million in the first quarter of this year, up from 47.9 million last year, collecting an estimated revenue of US$381 million. Romance and horror In Southeast Asia, a line-up ranging from Thai dramas to romance and comedy titles and Indonesian horror films is expected to boost viewership, as such content has \u201cthe strongest regional impact\u201d, according to Dhivya. Among the Indonesia-produced Netflix original content scheduled to premier later this year is a horror film depicting a dysfunctional family trapped in a zombie outbreak, tentatively called Abadi Non Jaya, as well as Borderless Fog, about a detective trying to solve serial murder cases along the Indonesia-Malaysia border. From Thailand, an eight-part show about a sex columnist called Doctor Climax premiered on June 13, while Tomorrow and I, an anthology series exploring the intersection of futuristic technologies and Thai culture, is slated to air in the near future. Unhinged zombies will also figure into the plot of Filipino-made film Outside, which will premiere on October 11.", "summary": "Local content such as Indonesian series Nightmares and Daydreams has earned praise from viewers, as Netflix seeks new Asian growth markets.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3268524/battle-eyeballs-netflix-boosts-southeast-asian-content-bid-fend-local-rivals", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/28/b7f0ed3f-17af-47d6-9757-eb98cc1c41c7_de378647.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:00:16", "author": "Resty Woro Yuniar", "authors": ["Resty Woro Yuniar"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.539}

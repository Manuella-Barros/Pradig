After Tim Beckham singled to load the bases, Machado hit a drive far over the center-field wall to give the Orioles their first lead.\n\nMachado also hit a two-run homer in the third and a solo shot in the fifth to finish with seven RBIs.\n\nAlbert Pujols set the tone for the game in the first inning with a milestone homer off Jeremy Hellickson. There would be plenty more long balls on a steamy night at Camden Yards.\n\n\"Obviously a good hitters' park,\" Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. \"We hit the ball good tonight; they did too. They got the last big hit.\"\n\nMachado's third slam of the year came on a fastball that caught way too much of the plate.\n\n\"I was looking for a pitch and I got it,\" he said. \"I made a good swing on it. Off the bat, I knew it was going to go far.\"\n\nSaid Middleton: \"I was trying to go fastball away, and I left the fastball over the middle.\"\n\nPujols' two-run drive was the 609th of his career, tied with Sammy Sosa for eighth on the all-time list. Pujols and Sosa share the distinction of hitting more home runs than any other foreign-born player.\n\nAfter Pujols and Kole Calhoun connected in succession in the first inning, C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart homered in the second for a 5-0 lead. The Orioles used homers by Mark Trumbo, Machado and Caleb Joseph and cut the gap to a run before a two-run drive by Mike Trout made it 7-4 in the fifth.\n\nAll five L.A. home runs came off Hellickson, the first time the right-hander yielded more than three in a game.\n\nBut his hard-hitting teammates made up the deficit.\n\n\"It's going to make my night a little better,\" Hellickson said. \"It would still have been nice to do my part in that win.\"\n\nDarren O'Day (4-1) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nROCKY SEASON DEBUT\n\nPitching for the first time since April 2016 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, Angels starter Andrew Heaney gave up five runs and seven hits -- including four home runs -- in five innings.\n\n\"I just really never got into a rhythm. My tempo was pretty terrible,\" he said. \"All of those things lead to bad pitches and lead to big innings. That's on me.\"\n\nScioscia said, \"\"It was good to see him out there. As he gets into his next start he'll get better.\"\n\nLUCKY FRIDAY\n\nThe Orioles lost 10 straight games on Friday since June 2 before rallying in this one.\n\nWELCOME TO THE BIGS\n\nOrioles Rule 5 pick Anthony Santander played in his first major league game, going 1 for 4 with a fine diving catch in right field. He was on the disabled list with a strained forearm from March 30 through Wednesday.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nAngels: LF Cameron Maybin was held out with a knee issue. \"He's OK. His knee was just a little bit stiff,\" Scioscia said.\n\nOrioles: 1B Chris Davis was feeling ill and did not play. ... SS J.J. Hardy (wrist) took batting practice and could start his rehabilitation assignment on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: JC Ramirez (10-10, 4.26 ERA) starts Saturday night. He gave up a grand slam to Machado last week and has a 7.27 ERA in his career against Baltimore.\n\nOrioles: Kevin Gausman (9-8, 5.08 ERA) has lost once in 10 starts since June 21, against the Angels last Wednesday night.\n\nFor more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tags/MLBbaseball", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:33:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2851, "textStart": 2845, "date": "-06-02", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 3100, "textStart": 3092, "date": "-03-30", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 3681, "textStart": 3674, "imp": true, "date": "2017-06-21", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 2367, "textStart": 2357, "date": "2016-04-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.9137254953384399, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373529", "time": "04:33:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373529", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "189313", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 2}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 3}, {"id": "304989", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disabled list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_list", "score": 2}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 5}, {"id": "310459", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tommy John surgery"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_John_surgery", "score": 2}, {"id": "310511", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "score": 1}, {"id": "310548", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "score": 5}, {"id": "310589", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (S)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(S)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "score": 3}, {"id": "310660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "score": 4}, {"id": "312731", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim", "score": 4}, {"id": "315353", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Albert Pujols"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pujols", "score": 5}, {"id": "325673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Single (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "326620", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Oriole Park at Camden Yards"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards", "score": 3}, {"id": "328427", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "334720", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "score": 2}, {"id": "350076", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike Trout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Trout", "score": 2}, {"id": "358564", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Buck Showalter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Showalter", "score": 3}, {"id": "365365", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cameron Maybin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Maybin", "score": 1}, {"id": "369187", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "score": 4}, {"id": "375952", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sammy Sosa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Sosa", "score": 3}, {"id": "377883", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Davis (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Davis_(baseball)", "score": 1}, {"id": "383104", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Hellickson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hellickson", "score": 3}, {"id": "393584", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "J.

After Tim Beckham singled to load the bases, Machado hit a drive far over the center-field wall to give the Orioles their first lead.\n\nMachado also hit a two-run homer in the third and a solo shot in the fifth to finish with seven RBIs.\n\nAlbert Pujols set the tone for the game in the first inning with a milestone homer off Jeremy Hellickson. There would be plenty more long balls on a steamy night at Camden Yards.\n\n\"Obviously a good hitters' park,\" Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. \"We hit the ball good tonight; they did too. They got the last big hit.\"\n\nMachado's third slam of the year came on a fastball that caught way too much of the plate.\n\n\"I was looking for a pitch and I got it,\" he said. \"I made a good swing on it. Off the bat, I knew it was going to go far.\"\n\nSaid Middleton: \"I was trying to go fastball away, and I left the fastball over the middle.\"\n\nPujols' two-run drive was the 609th of his career, tied with Sammy Sosa for eighth on the all-time list. Pujols and Sosa share the distinction of hitting more home runs than any other foreign-born player.\n\nAfter Pujols and Kole Calhoun connected in succession in the first inning, C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart homered in the second for a 5-0 lead. The Orioles used homers by Mark Trumbo, Machado and Caleb Joseph and cut the gap to a run before a two-run drive by Mike Trout made it 7-4 in the fifth.\n\nAll five L.A. home runs came off Hellickson, the first time the right-hander yielded more than three in a game.\n\nBut his hard-hitting teammates made up the deficit.\n\n\"It's going to make my night a little better,\" Hellickson said. \"It would still have been nice to do my part in that win.\"\n\nDarren O'Day (4-1) got the win with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.\n\nROCKY SEASON DEBUT\n\nPitching for the first time since April 2016 after undergoing Tommy John surgery, Angels starter Andrew Heaney gave up five runs and seven hits - including four home runs - in five innings.\n\n\"I just really never got into a rhythm. My tempo was pretty terrible,\" he said. \"All of those things lead to bad pitches and lead to big innings. That's on me.\"\n\nScioscia said, \"\"It was good to see him out there. As he gets into his next start he'll get better.\"\n\nLUCKY FRIDAY\n\nThe Orioles lost 10 straight games on Friday since June 2 before rallying in this one.\n\nWELCOME TO THE BIGS\n\nOrioles Rule 5 pick Anthony Santander played in his first major league game, going 1 for 4 with a fine diving catch in right field. He was on the disabled list with a strained forearm from March 30 through Wednesday.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nAngels: LF Cameron Maybin was held out with a knee issue. \"He's OK. His knee was just a little bit stiff,\" Scioscia said.\n\nOrioles: 1B Chris Davis was feeling ill and did not play. ... SS J.J. Hardy (wrist) took batting practice and could start his rehabilitation assignment on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: JC Ramirez (10-10, 4.26 ERA) starts Saturday night. He gave up a grand slam to Machado last week and has a 7.27 ERA in his career against Baltimore.\n\nOrioles: Kevin Gausman (9-8, 5.08 ERA) has lost once in 10 starts since June 21, against the Angels last Wednesday night.\n\n--\n\nFor more AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/tags/MLBbaseball", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:24:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2851, "textStart": 2845, "date": "-06-02", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 3100, "textStart": 3092, "date": "-03-30", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 3681, "textStart": 3674, "imp": true, "date": "2017-06-21", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 2369, "textStart": 2359, "date": "2016-04-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.9137254953384399, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373529", "time": "04:24:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373529", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "189313", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 2}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 3}, {"id": "304989", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disabled list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_list", "score": 2}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 5}, {"id": "310459", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tommy John surgery"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_John_surgery", "score": 2}, {"id": "310511", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "score": 1}, {"id": "310548", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "score": 5}, {"id": "310589", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (S)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(S)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "score": 3}, {"id": "310660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "score": 4}, {"id": "312731", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim", "score": 4}, {"id": "315353", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Albert Pujols"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pujols", "score": 5}, {"id": "325673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Single (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "326620", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Oriole Park at Camden Yards"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards", "score": 3}, {"id": "328427", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "334720", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "score": 2}, {"id": "350076", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike Trout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Trout", "score": 2}, {"id": "358564", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Buck Showalter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Showalter", "score": 3}, {"id": "365365", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cameron Maybin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Maybin", "score": 1}, {"id": "369187", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "score": 4}, {"id": "375952", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sammy Sosa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Sosa", "score": 3}, {"id": "377883", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Davis (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Davis_(baseball)", "score": 1}, {"id": "383104", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Hellickson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hellickson", "score": 3}, {"id": "393584", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "J.

So, what exactly did you expect when he came up with a the Orioles down two and the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth?\n\nHe hammered a one-out grand slam for his third home run of the night and the Orioles escaped with a 9-7 victory Friday night before 26,185 at Camden Yards.\n\nIt was his third grand slam in the past 11 games and it was a huge blow for the Orioles (60-62), who were on the verge of falling four games behind in the crowded race for the second American League wild-card slot.\n\nWhat a way to finish a game that certainly didn't start well.\n\nNew Orioles starter Jeremy Hellickson had given up as many as three home runs in a game just once this season and had never given up more, but the Angels apparently failed to read the game notes Friday night.\n\nThey homered four times before Hellickson could get his fifth out of the evening and allowed one more before leaving the game in the fifth inning.\n\nAlbert Pujols started the barrage in the first inning with a line drive into the left-field seats that was his 609th career home run. The two-run shot tied him with Sammy Sosa for the most home runs all time by a foreign-born major leaguer and eighth place overall.\n\nThe way the ball was flying out of Oriole Park, it didn't look like Sosa's share of that distinction would last the night.\n\nRight fielder Kole Calhoun followed immediately with a shot to center field for his 15th homer of the season, and Hellickson would give up solo homers to C.J. Cron and Kaleb Cowart before the second out of the second inning.\n\nThings were looking pretty grim until the Orioles also discovered that the 6-o'clock cloudburst that delayed the start of the game for 42 minutes also turned Camden Yards into a giant pinball machine.\n\nMark Trumbo got the Orioles on the board with a towering solo shot in the bottom of the second -- his 19th homer of the year. Caleb Joseph led off the Orioles third with his eighth homer of the season before Machado made it a one-run game with a two-run moonshot to center. By the end of the evening, Machado would be tied for the club lead with 26 homers and closer to team leader Jonathan Schoop with 81 RBIs after driving in seven Friday.\n\nHellickson seemed to regain his footing after the fourth Angels homer and retired the next nine batters in order to allow his teammates to creep back into the game, but Mike Trout cranked a two-run shot in the fifth inning for a 7-4 lead.\n\nThe Orioles right-hander allowed seven runs on eight hits over 4 2/3 innings before being replaced by reliever Miguel Castro. Richard Bleier pitched two-thirds of an inning and Darren O'Day (2-3) finished up with 1 1/3 scoreless innings to earn the win.\n\nSantander's debut: Rule 5 draft pick Anthony Santander was a surprise addition to the Orioles lineup Friday night and he made a good first impression in right field.\n\nHe ranged far to his left to make a diving catch and rob Trout of a hit in the second inning. It wasn't quite a work of art, however, since he bounced back up and immediately lost his footing and belly-flopped on the wet grass a second time.\n\nSantander went down weakly in his first three at-bats, but got his first major league hit to lead off the bottom of the ninth.\n\nTerrestrial meteor shower: Through the first three innings, eight balls were hit with an exit velocity of at least 101 mph, according to Statcast.\n\npeter.schmuck@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/schmuckstop", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:25:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "dateCrawl":

Before the introductions, Anderson won a Home Run Derby over Sam Horn, Joe Orsulak, Hoiles and Mike Devereaux. Rick Sutcliffe, who tossed a shutout in that 1992 opener, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nAngels: OF Cameron Maybin, who leads the team with 25 stolen bases, missed a second straight game with a sore knee.\n\nOrioles: 1B Chris Davis was sidelined by a virus for the second game in a row. ... SS J.J. Hardy (fractured wrist) remains on course to start a rehab assignment next week and could return by Sept. 1.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: Drafted by the Orioles in 2010 and traded by Baltimore to the Angels in April, the surprisingly successful Parker Bridwell (7-1, 2.88 ERA) makes his first appearance at Camden Yards in the series finale Sunday. The Angels are 11-1 in games started by Bridwell, whose career with the Orioles consisted of two appearances and a 13.50 ERA.\n\nOrioles: Chris Tillman (1-7, 7.83 ERA) is expected to make his first start since being demoted to the bullpen two weeks ago.

JC Ramirez left the game in the sixth inning with right forearm irritation. There was no immediate word on the severity.\n\nAt least they could wonder after a victory, which came a night after they blew an early five-run lead and lost on a walk-off grand slam. They began burying those memories in the first inning on Saturday, with a homer barrage that started with Trout's 25th of the season.\n\nTrout became just the third player ever to have six 25-homer seasons before his age-26 season, joining Hall of Famers Frank Robinson and Eddie Mathews.\n\nTwo innings later, Trout added No. 26, his third in a span of five plate appearances, back to Friday night.\n\nTrout's homers in the first and third innings were wrapped around Valbuena's in the second and fourth.\n\nValbuena, who missed the season's first five weeks with a strained right hamstring, slumped for most of the season after he came back, his average sitting under .200.\n\nSince the All-Star break, though, he's been on a power surge. He has hit nine homers since the break, including four this week. Valbuena's two-run homer in the fourth, his 15th of the season, put the Angels up 5-1.\n\nWhile they were hitting homers, Ramirez worked his way around a rough first inning to get into the sixth.\n\nAfter he covered first to get the second out of the inning, he indicated something didn't feel right. Trainer Adam Nevala came to the mound, and left with Ramirez.\n\nRamirez retired nine of the last 10 batters he faced, after allowing a run in the first on two hits, a walk and a wild pitch.\n\nUnlike Friday night, the Angels' bullpen locked this one down.

It hadn't been above .240 since the fourth game of the year, and some wondered if Machado was destined to have one of those off years.\n\nSince then, his average has steadily climbed, the power followed and over the past 15 games, his surge has reached a new level.\n\nThe fact that Machado hit three homers and drove in seven runs in the Orioles' 9-7 comeback win over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night was one thing, but that he walked off the victory with his third grand slam in a span of 11 games was another.\n\nMachado watched the 0-1 pitch from Angels reliever Keynan Middleton land in the glove of closer Zach Britton, who had enough time to walk from the Orioles bullpen to the grassy area in front of the center-field batter's eye to catch the ball.\n\n\"I got it,\" Machado said. \"I was looking for a pitch and I got it. I made a good swing on it. Off the bat, I knew it was going to go far. It's always good to get yourself in the situation that you could try to put the team above you, and try to go for it.\"\n\nAs Machado rounded first base, he yelled \"Let's go\" into the Orioles dugout as his teammates began flooding out to home plate, where Jonathan Schoop and Adam Jones doused Machado with water before he touched home plate.\n\n\"It's about giving guys some space to be themselves,\" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \"And also to -- some guys are looking at the order going, 'I hope this game doesn't come to me,' but very seldom at the big league level.\"\n\nWith 26 homers, Machado has now tied Schoop for the team lead, his 81 RBIs trail only Schoop and his .494 slugging percentage is third behind Schoop and Trey Mancini.\n\nAs much as Machado spent the opening months of the season grinding, as much as he might've been trying to hit the ball out of the yard too often, now there might not be a player anyone would rather have at the plate with the bases loaded. As the Orioles waited for the Machado they knew would return, a new one has emerged.\n\nOver his past 14 games, Machado is hitting .371 with eight homers and 26 RBIs. Over that stretch, Machado is a perfect 4-for-4 with the bases loaded, hitting three grand slams, a two-run single and a sacrifice fly over that stretch. Before that, Machado was still hitting a respectable .429 with the bases loaded, but all three of those hits were singles.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Machado said. \"Everybody likes to hit with people on base. Those are RBIs you've got [to get], especially with less than two outs. You try to get one at least. That's my mentality going up there, which is at least get one guy in with less than two outs with a guy like that. Just put the ball up in the air. I've been fortunate to have a little more power and get a little stronger as the years go on and those fly balls keep going a little bit.\"\n\nNo player has hit more grand slams since the beginning of the 2016 season than Machado, hitting six of his seven career slams over that span. No other player has more than four (the Los Angeles Dodgers' Chris Taylor) over the past two seasons.\n\nOver that stretch, Machado has hit safely in half of his at-bats with the bases loaded, going 11-for-22 with 36 RBIs.\n\nMachado opened the road trip at the Angels with a game-winning grand slam on Aug. 7, then hit another in Monday's win at the Seattle Mariners.\n\nOn Friday, the Orioles set the stage for Machado by pecking away at the Angels bullpen. Rule 5 draft pick Anthony Santander had his first major league hit off Yusmeiro Petit to open the inning. Two batters later, pinch hitter Seth Smith drew a seven-pitch walk and shortstop Tim Beckham then hit an opposite-field single off Middleton to load the bases.\n\n\"If we want to win and take it to the next level, this is what we have to do,\" Machado said. \"Keep fighting and pass the baton and next guy [can] do damage. The last inning, man on first and second, Beckham can homer easily. He got on base and passed the baton. That's what we have to do if we're going to be successful and make it somewhere. Our pitching staff is going to have to do well and pass the baton to the next guy, the next guy. We get into a good situation where we go forward.\"\n\neencina@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/EddieInTheYard", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T05:47:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3310, "textStart": 3304, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-07", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373529", "time": "05:47:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373529", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302619", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home plate"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Home_plate", "score": 4}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 3}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 5}, {"id": "303714", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "304985", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "score": 2}, {"id": "305016", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "score": 1}, {"id": "305018", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "score": 3}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 1}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 5}, {"id": "305787", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "score": 1}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 5}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 3}, {"id": "310508", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "score": 2}, {"id": "310511", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "score": 3}, {"id": "310591", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "score": 3}, {"id": "310660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "score": 3}, {"id": "310664", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310668", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "score": 2}, {"id": "310670", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batter's eye"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batter's_eye", "score": 3}, {"id": "312731", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim", "score": 3}, {"id": "356283", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Zach Britton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Britton", "score": 3}, {"id": "358564", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Buck Showalter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Showalter", "score": 3}, {"id": "396872", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "score": 4}, {"id": "422010", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Schoop"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Schoop", "score": 3}, {"id": "441356", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Seth Smith"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Smith", "score": 1}, {"id": "519420", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tim Beckham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Beckham", "score": 1}, {"id": "541330", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Yusmeiro Petit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusmeiro_Petit", "score": 1}], "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5997cc05/turbine/bs-sp-orioles-machado-20170819", "timeCrawl": "05:47:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Orioles' Manny Machado proving to be the king of slams", "originalArticle": null}

Now, the Orioles will try to keep this roll at Camden Yards going on Saturday night.\n\nThe victory improved Baltimore (60-62) to 36-23 at home -- compared to 24-39 on the road. Orioles manager Buck Showalter said he doesn't worry about the past; he just wants them to keep winning.\n\nShowalter knows the Orioles have 40 games left and are fighting for a wild-card spot. They now are two games behind the Angels (62-60) and the Minnesota Twins (61-59), who are deadlocked for the last wild-card berth.\n\n\"You don't think about what it might have been,\" Showalter said. \"You play again tomorrow and you play the next day and there's an opportunity around every corner. It has that potential always, but it depends on how we pitch tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day.\"\n\nBoth teams hit five homers in Friday's Baltimore win, but Manny Machado has finally gotten going. He's hit three grand slams in 11 games and given the Orioles a big lift, including his walk-off grand slam Friday, a game where Machado finished with seven RBIs.\n\n\"I know sometimes because of how fluid he is, sometimes people don't know how much he cares and how hard he works,\" Showalter said. \"For a young player to go through the struggles he did with that kind of talent, to get back is a real testament to him and his makeup.\"\n\nIn the middle game of the series, Kevin Gausman (9-8, 5.08) will start for the Orioles versus JC Ramirez (10-10, 4.26). Gausman has pitched much better in the second half of the season, giving a boost to an inconsistent starting rotation.\n\nThe right-hander's last outing came on Aug. 14 in an 11-3 victory over the Mariners in Seattle. He allowed two runs on six hits in seven innings as the Orioles won the first game of that three-game series.\n\nGausman has a 1-2 career mark against the Angels along with a 5.11 ERA.\n\nRamirez has an 0-1 career record with a 7.27 ERA versus Baltimore. The last time he pitched against the Orioles was last week, taking the loss in a 6-2 Baltimore win.\n\nHe gave up six runs on eight hits in seven innings in that loss, the big hit being a Machado grand slam.\n\nFor the Orioles, Chris Davis and Welington Castillo both missed Friday's game due to undisclosed illness. There might be more news about them on Saturday.\n\nBaltimore also has not announced a starter for Sunday's series finale but there's a chance it could be Chris Tillman. His last two appearances have come from the bullpen after losing his regular spot in the rotation by going 1-7 in his first 15 starts.\n\nThe Angels placed starter Tyler Skaggs on the bereavement list Friday (three days) due to the death of his grandfather.

After an early five-run deficit, Machado -- who had already homered twice -- came up with the bases loaded and did the unthinkable: blasting a grand slam to catapult Baltimore to a 9-7 walkoff win over the Angels.\n\n\"If we want to win and take it to the next level, this is what we have to do,\" said Machado, who also homered in the second and fifth innings off Angels starter Andrew Heaney in his seven-RBI night.\n\n\"You try to get one [run in] at least. That's my mentality going up there, which is at least, 'Get one guy in with less than two outs,' with a guy like that. Just put the ball up in the air. I've been fortunate to have a little more power and get a little stronger as the years go on and those fly balls keep going a little bit.\"\n\nThe fateful one-out, ninth-inning blast came on the second pitch Machado saw from Angels reliever Keynan Middleton, soaring over the center-field wall and into the Orioles bullpen ... into the glove of closer Zach Britton.\n\n* Flown save: Closer runs down Manny mash\n\n\"I was warming up,\" Britton said. \"Once Manny hit it, I knew it was gone. [Darren] O'Day would have disowned me had I not caught that ball.\"\n\nThis is the second year in a row Machado has had three home runs and seven RBIs in a game, with the third baseman doing so on Aug. 7, 2016. The only other player to accomplish the feat twice in O's history is Eddie Murray, who did so in 1979 and '85.\n\nThe Orioles relievers' home run competition aside, Machado's slam mattered a lot. It mattered to the All-Star third baseman, who now has 26 homers on the year after a frustratingly slow first half. It mattered to the Angels, who saw their bullpen woes continue. And perhaps it will matter to the rest of the American League Wild Card hopefuls, a group so jumbled up that there is no clear leader of the pack.\n\n* O's celebrate 25th anniversary of Oriole Park\n\nMachado is the special talent that could help separate the O's from the chaff.\n\n\"I cannot tell you how hard it is to do, but there's always that potential when you're dealing with guys like Manny,\" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said of Machado's impressive evening, which pulled Baltimore two games behind the Angels and Twins in the AL Wild Card race.\n\n\"I know sometimes because of how fluid he is, sometimes people don't know how much he cares and how hard he works. For a young player to go through the struggles he did with that kind of talent, to get back is a real testament to him and his makeup.\"\n\nMachado's slam also brought back an oft-missing element of Orioles wins -- the postgame pie. Center fielder Adam Jones wasted no time making his move, nabbing Machado in the face while he was conducting an on-field interview.\n\n\"We haven't done the pie all year. But we're glad it's back,\" Machado said. \"The last time the pies were out there, we had some wins and we had nice win streaks and we got the team where it needed to go, which was a division championship. So let's keep doing it.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T06:35:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1323, "textStart": 1311, "date": "2016-08-07", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373529", "time": "06:35:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373529", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "189313", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 3}, {"id": "303714", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 5}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 3}, {"id": "306191", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pie"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie", "score": 1}, {"id": "310552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "score": 3}, {"id": "310590", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310591", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "score": 3}, {"id": "310660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "score": 4}, {"id": "310664", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "310669", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "310901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "score": 3}, {"id": "312236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "score": 2}, {"id": "314175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "score": 2}, {"id": "325678", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "score": 3}, {"id": "328427", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "335355", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catapult"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapult", "score": 4}, {"id": "356283", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Zach Britton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Britton", "score": 3}, {"id": "358564", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Buck Showalter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Showalter", "score": 2}, {"id": "476889", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Eddie Murray"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murray", "score": 2}], "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/3/7/6/249360376/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "timeCrawl": "06:35:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Orioles Manny Machado turning season around", "originalArticle": null}

But on Saturday night, the Orioles right-hander tied his career high by allowing four homers over four innings against the Los Angeles Angels in a 5-1 loss at Camden Yards\n\nThe Orioles overcame a home-run barrage Friday, outslugging the Angels on Manny Machado's walk-off grand slam in the ninth. But they couldn't hide another short outing from the team's starting rotation.\n\nGausman's start marked the fourth straight game in which an Orioles starting pitcher failed to get through five innings. Over that stretch, the club's rotation owns a 10.70 ERA.\n\nOn a night in which the Orioles welcomed back members of the first team to play at Camden Yards as part of the ballpark's 25th-anniversary celebration -- the Orioles also wore uniforms from 1992 in front of a packed crowd of 43,929 -- this year's club continued to struggle building momentum in the wild-card race.\n\nWith the loss, the Orioles (60-63) fell to three games out of the second American League wild card held by the Minnesota Twins and Angels.\n\nThe Angels arrived at Camden Yards ranked 25th in the majors in home runs. But they hit nine over the first two games of the series between the two teams jockeying for position in the muddled playoff race.\n\nOne day after the teams combined for 10 homers in Friday's series opener, the Angels received multihomer games from Mike Trout and Luis Valbuena.\n\nThree of the Angels' four homers off Gausman came on four-seam fastballs, and the right-hander allowed one homer in each of his first four innings.\n\nGausman entered the night having posted five quality starts over his previous six outings, and he had allowed just four homers combined over that stretch.\n\nBut the Angels (63-60) jumped on Gausman early, with Trout taking an 0-1 pitch nearly to the left-field concourse an estimated 429 feet. Valbuena opened the second inning with a solo blast that landed just out of left fielder Seth Smith's reach to put the Angels up 2-1.\n\nTrout hit his second home run of the night -- and his 26th of the season -- with one out in the third, a 418-foot blast off a 1-1 hanging slider that landed in the Angels' top-tier bullpen in left-center field. Valbuena's second blast -- his 15th of the season -- came after Andrelton Simmons opened the fourth with a double. Valbuena turned on a 96 mph 2-1 delivery from Gausman and sent it into the first row of the left-field stands.\n\nGausman escaped the fourth inning, inducing a pop-up from Trout with runners on second and third, but he'd last just two batters in the fifth after he allowed a leadoff single to Albert Pujols and walked Kole Calhoun.\n\nIt was Gausman's second rocky outing against the Angels; he allowed four runs over 5 1/3 innings two starts ago in Anaheim. Take away those two outings and Gausman has a 1.04 ERA in his five other starts over the past month.\n\nSmith plays big\n\nSmith just missed catching Valbuena's second homer, but positioned himself well under Martin Maldonado's fly ball to deep left off reliever Miguel Castro with the bases loaded in the fifth.\n\nSmith made a leaping catch right at the left-field warning track in front of the wall, robbing extra bases from Maldonado and possibly a grand slam that would have broken the game wide open.\n\nCastro provides length\n\nFor the second straight night, Castro saved the Orioles bullpen by providing multiple-inning length after a short start.\n\nCastro tossed 2 1/3 scoreless innings on back-to-back nights, facing just eight batters -- one over the minimum -- on Saturday.\n\nHe loaded the bases in the fifth after walking Valbuena with two on and two out, then struck out C.J. Cron and induced the deep fly to left from Maldonado that Smith caught.\n\nFive of Castro's past seven outings have been two innings or longer, and he's provided an important bridge to the late innings.\n\nCastro, left-hander Richard Bleier and right-hander Mychal Givens combined for five scoreless relief innings Saturday.\n\nOrioles waste early opportunities\n\nThe Orioles had early-inning scoring chances against Angels starter J.C Ramirez, but plated their only run of the game on a Ramirez wild pitch that scored Tim Beckham in the first inning.\n\nThey put the first two batters of the game on base against Ramirez with Beckham's leadoff double and Manny Machado's single, but that inning was squashed by a 4-6-3 double play off the bat of Trey Mancini.\n\nThe Orioles also put runners at second and third with two outs in the third inning, but Mancini grounded out to third to end the inning.\n\nOverall, the Orioles were 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position.\n\nRamirez held the Orioles to one run on five hits over 5 1/3 innings before leaving the game with right forearm irritation.\n\nThe Orioles recorded just two hits after Anthony Santander's leadoff single int the fifth as the Angels retired 15 of the final 17 Orioles batters they faced on the night.\n\nTrout joins elite company\n\nWith his first homer of the night two batters into the game, Trout became the third player in major league history to record six 25-homer seasons before his age-26 season.\n\nFormer Orioles Frank Robinson and Eddie Mathews, both Hall of Famers, are the only others to accomplish that feat.\n\neencina@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/EddieInTheYard", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:20:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.615686297416687, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri":

With his team down 5-2 in the third inning, Machado smoked a two-run tater 418-feet to center field. With the Orioles down 7-4 in the fifth inning, Machado yanked a 400-foot solo dinger to left field. And with the score stuck at 7-5 in the bottom of the ninth inning, Machado took a strike looking and then did this:\n\nMachado was batting just .215/.283/.418 on July 6. He smoked a pair of dingers as part of a four-hit day on July 7, and has been on an absolute tear ever since, bringing his slash line all the way up to .264/.319/.494 in 37 games. And the power, the power has been very good. Last night's grand slam was Machado's third in 11 games. He's up to 28 runs batted in in the month of August, and since the start of July he's had more than four times as many multi-hit games (17) as he's had multi-strikeout games (four).\n\nThe Orioles are still two games under .500, but they're also only two games back of the final American League Wild Card spot, and after a miserable May and early June they seem to have mostly righted the ship. There was talk earlier in the summer of the O's trading away Machado, but I have a better idea: literally never trade Manny Machado. He's got a higher career WAR (27.9) than Bryce Harper (26).

Ram\u00edrez (10-10, 4.26)\n\nWhat to watch\n\n1. Happy anniversary. Be in your seats early -- as in by 6 p.m. -- as the Orioles celebrate the 25th anniversary of Camden Yards with a Home Run Derby involving members of the 1992 team as well as a special pregame ceremony. See if Cal Ripken Jr. was right, that Brady Anderson set up the derby field so he could win.\n\n2. Sub-5.00 opportunity. Kevin Gausman takes the mound with a chance to get his ERA under 5.00 for the first time since his third start of the season. If Gausman keeps pitching the way he has for most of the past month, that's a realistic possibility. The right-hander has a 1.80 ERA over his past six starts to bring his ERA from 6.39 to 5.08.\n\n3. Macho carryover. The Orioles and Angels combined for 10 home runs Friday night, five apiece, with Manny Machado hitting three to lead the way. The biggest was the last swing of the game -- a walk-off grand slam with the Orioles trailing by two in the ninth. Machado now has three grand slams in his past 11 games, and 28 RBIs in his past 15 games. Can keep it going tonight against the Angels? The Orioles might need it with Chris Davis and Welington Castillo again out of the lineup because of illness.\n\nOrioles lineup\n\nSS Tim Beckham\n\n3B Manny Machado\n\n2B Jonathan Schoop\n\nCF Adam Jones\n\n1B Trey Mancini\n\nDH Mark Trumbo\n\nLF Seth Smith\n\nRF Anthony Santander\n\nC Caleb Joseph\n\njland@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/JoshLandSun", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:46:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373529", "time": "19:46:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373529", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "303569", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 4}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 2}, {"id": "304992", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "score": 5}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 2}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "310657", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "310660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "score": 5}, {"id": "325678", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "score": 1}, {"id": "326620", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Oriole Park at Camden Yards"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards", "score": 5}, {"id": "327981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "score": 1}, {"id": "328595", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cal Ripken, Jr."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Ripken,_Jr.", "score": 3}, {"id": "358565", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Gausman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Gausman", "score": 4}, {"id": "377883", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Davis (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Davis_(baseball)", "score": 1}, {"id": "383029", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orioles", "score": 4}, {"id": "396872", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "score": 2}, {"id": "401035", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Mid-Atlantic Sports Network"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Sports_Network", "score": 4}, {"id": "419672", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brady Anderson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Anderson", "score": 3}, {"id": "422010", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Schoop"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Schoop", "score": 1}, {"id": "510757", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Welington Castillo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welington_Castillo", "score": 1}, {"id": "519420", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tim Beckham"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Beckham", "score": 1}, {"id": "547640", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WJZ-FM"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJZ-FM", "score": 4}, {"id": "1268874", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home Run Derby (Major League Baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Run_Derby_(Major_League_Baseball)", "score": 3}], "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5998921e/turbine/bs-sp-orioles-on-deck-angels-0819", "timeCrawl": "19:46:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Orioles on deck: What to watch Saturday vs. Angels", "originalArticle": null}

It's not like basketball where the team with the best overall player on the court normally wins out, and it's not like football where having a good quarterback alone can lift you into playoff contention in the NFL. In baseball, one player doesn't normally dominate and drag their team to victory by himself. However, Manny Machado tried his very best to buck that trend with the gargantuan performance that he delivered on Friday night.\n\nThe Orioles were down 5-0 at one point against the Angels, but they continued to scratch and claw their way out of that hole for the entirety of the game, and Machado played a huge role in that comeback. He started his attack on LA's pitching staff in the third inning by turning a seven-pitch duel into a two-run dinger. His next at-bat only lasted three pitches, but the end result was the same -- a home run. By that time, the O's had five runs on the board but the comeback wasn't complete as the Angels still had seven. There was still work to be done, but Machado wasn't done, either.\n\nBy the time the bottom of the ninth inning rolled around, the Angels still had their two-run lead, but it was an extremely tenuous lead and things got especially dangerous when the O's loaded the bases with just one out. Manny Machado had an opportunity to turn this into a night that Baltimore fans wouldn't forget for a long time, and he delivered. Keynan Middleton gave Machado a meaty ball right down the middle of the plate to smack, and he smacked it right into Zach Britton's glove in the bullpen. The comeback was complete, the O's had won the game, and Manny Machado had completed one of the most dominating single-game performances by a batter in recent memory.\n\nWith the way the AL Wild Card is loooking right now, every game is crucial. It's still a bit early to say whether or not this will be a major moment in the race for either team, but if Baltimore makes the playoffs, they'll have Manny Machado's otherworldly effort on a muggy night in August to thank as part of the effort to get them into October baseball again.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T13:46:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5568627715110779, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373529", "time": "13:46:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373529", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "189313", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "303711", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "score": 5}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "310660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "score": 3}, {"id": "311917", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "At bat"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "score": 2}, {"id": "356283", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Zach Britton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Britton", "score": 2}, {"id": "361271", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (D)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(D)", "score": 3}, {"id": "396872", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "score": 5}, {"id": "548622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball wild card"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_wild_card", "score": 1}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xY4c125cqOf5GPDOvPUG-4NleOc=/0x66:3000x1754/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56268883/835339906.0.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:50:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Manny Machado unleashed his fury on the Angels", "originalArticle": null}

It was that kind of night. In total, there were 58 home runs hit on Friday, second most in major league history.\n\nWe take a look at some of the best stats by the numbers:\n\n8 : It's the eighth time this season there have been at least 50 home runs hit in a single day. From 2008 to '16, there were only six such days.\n\n16: There were 16 runs scored between the Los Angeles Angels and Baltimore Orioles on Friday, all via the home run. The Orioles and Angels combined for 10 homers in the game. According to Elias, it was the third time in MLB history that teams combined for 10 home runs that accounted for every run in the game.\n\n3: Manny Machado became the third player in MLB history to cap three-homer game with a walk-off grand slam. He joins Khris Davis (2016) and Joey Votto (2012) as the only players to accomplish the feat, according to Elias.\n\n2: Byron Buxton and Nick Delmonico each had an inside-the-park home run. It was the first time there were two in the same day since July 8, 2015. On that day, Jarrod Dyson (with the Royals) and Logan Forsythe (with the Rays) did it in the same game.\n\n609: Albert Pujols hit his 609th career home run, tying Sammy Sosa for the eighth-most all time, and most by a player born outside the 50 states. Pujols has a unique link to the single-day homer record. Of all the players to hit a home run Friday, he is the only player who homered on both days.\n\n1963: The Angels joined the 1963 Cubs as the only two teams in MLB history to give up three walk-off grand slams in a single season. All three have come since July 25 for the Angels.\n\n0: The top eight MLB leaders in homers entering the day didn't hit a single home run Friday.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T07:01:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1096, "textStart": 1084, "date": "2015-07-08", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1666, "textStart": 1659, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-25", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373529", "time": "07:01:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373529", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 5}, {"id": "310515", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Inside-the-park home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside-the-park_home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "310657", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "310660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "score": 5}, {"id": "312731", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim", "score": 3}, {"id": "312738", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "score": 2}, {"id": "315353", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Albert Pujols"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pujols", "score": 3}, {"id": "322748", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "score": 2}, {"id": "330938", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Byron Buxton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Buxton", "score": 2}, {"id": "375952", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sammy Sosa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Sosa", "score": 2}, {"id": "383510", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Joey Votto"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Votto", "score": 2}, {"id": "384188", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Logan Forsythe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Forsythe", "score": 2}, {"id": "396872", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "score": 3}, {"id": "398960", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Dyson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Dyson", "score": 2}, {"id": "406432", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Khris Davis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khristopher_Davis", "score": 2}, {"id": "637649", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "50 home run club"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_home_run_club", "score": 3}], "image": "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0818%2F835339906_17151053.JPG", "timeCrawl": "07:01:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Every crazy stat from a homer happy Friday", "originalArticle": null}

On Saturday night, however, the Baltimore Orioles right-hander tied his career high by giving up four homers over four innings against the Los Angeles Angels in a 5-1 loss at Camden Yards before 43,929.\n\nThe Orioles overcame a home-run barrage Friday, outslugging the Angels on Manny Machado's walk-off grand slam in the ninth. But they couldn't hide another short outing from their starting rotation.\n\nSaturday marked the fourth straight game in which an Orioles starting pitcher failed to get through five innings. Over that stretch, the rotation owns a 10.70 ERA.\n\nOn Saturday, the Orioles welcomed back members of the first team to play at Camden Yards as part of the ballpark's 25th-anniversary celebration -- the Orioles also wore uniforms from 1992 in front of a packed crowd.\n\nYet this year's club continued to struggle to build momentum in the wild-card race.\n\nWith the loss, the Orioles (60-63) fell three games out of the second American League wild card spot held by the Minnesota Twins and Angels.\n\nThe Angels arrived at Camden Yards ranked 25th in the majors in home runs. But they have hit nine over the first two games of the series. One day after the teams combined for 10 homers in Friday's series opener, the Angels received multihomer games from Mike Trout and Luis Valbuena.\n\nThree of the Angels' four homers off Gausman came on four-seam fastballs, and the right-hander allowed one homer in each of his first four innings.\n\n-- Baltimore Sun", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373529", "time": "04:04:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373529", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "189313", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303569", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "score": 3}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 2}, {"id": "304992", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "305860", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "score": 2}, {"id": "310553", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball park"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_park", "score": 4}, {"id": "310657", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "310660", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "score": 5}, {"id": "312731", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim", "score": 3}, {"id": "314175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "score": 2}, {"id": "326620", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Oriole Park at Camden Yards"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards", "score": 4}, {"id": "350076", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike Trout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Trout", "score": 1}, {"id": "358565", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Gausman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Gausman", "score": 4}, {"id": "383029", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Orioles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orioles", "score": 5}, {"id": "396872", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "score": 3}, {"id": "430008", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Luis Valbuena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Valbuena", "score": 1}, {"id": "548622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball wild card"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_wild_card", "score": 2}, {"id": "1275467", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Major League Baseball single-game home run leaders"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_single-game_home_run_leaders", "score": 3}], "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/20/Production/Daily/Sports/Images/Angels_Orioles_Baseball_07846-fbe69.jpg?t=20170517", "wgt": 1, "timeCrawl": "04:04:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Kevin Gausman gives up four home runs as Orioles lose, 5-1", "originalArticle": null}], "pages": 32}}}

{"id": 243295912, "title": "Surprise! Edmonton Oilers trade for last pick in first round, select London Knights forward Sam O'Reilly", "text": "Just like that the Oilers were on the clock, and their brass (Jeff Jackson, Kris Knoblauch, Rick Pracey) were on the stage. The club announced the selection of Sam O\u2019Reilly, a forward who played for the OHL champion London Knights. A fairly recent convert from defence to forward, the right-shot O\u2019Reilly can reportedly play centre or wing, making him a pretty darn versatile hockey player. Decent size at 6\u20191, 186. Tturned 18 on Mar 30 placing him in the middle of the class by age. As an OHL rookier in 2023-24, O\u2019Reilly put up decent numbers in the full 68 games with 20-36-56, +32, then added 5-7-12, +2 in 16 playoff games. He then posted 1-3-4, +2 in 4 games at the Memorial Cup, where the Knights fell in the final to Saginaw Spirit on a 60th minute goal. Elite Prospects provides the following thumbnail scouting report: O\u2019Reilly is a relentless shutdown defensive centre with physicality, details, and a clever quick-touch passing game. Moments where he\u2019s not perfectly positioned are rare, and his endless work rate allows him to impact plays many can\u2019t. He checks the hands, ties up sticks, and torpedoes himself into opponents along the wall.

The local squad had long since traded away its first-round pick, with a long wait until pick #64 on Saturday morning and an even longer one to #160 and a few more after that.

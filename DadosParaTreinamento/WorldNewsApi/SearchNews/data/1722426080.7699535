The medication acts \u201cin exactly the same way\u201d in younger patients as it does in adults, they claim, and while no evidence exists for use in patients under the age of 12, it \u201cmay be justified\u201d in extreme cases. The comments were made by Professor Louise Baur, an obesity paediatrician and professor of paediatrics at the University of Sydney in Australia, during a presentation at the International Congress on Obesity in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Prof Baur, who is president of the World Obesity Federation, said: \u201cObesity among the youngest in our society is increasingly common. \u201cAnd just as we have realised with adults, obesity is not an acute-care, once-treated-always-cured disease. \u201cThe use of the latest generation of obesity management medications could present a less invasive option for adolescents with more severe obesity. \u201cThe evidence from various recent trials shows that these new medications, such as semaglutide, act in exactly the same way in adolescents as in adults, with a similar safety profile. \u201cOne of the ways in which semaglutide works is by acting on brain appetite centres, promoting a sense of satiety, reducing hunger and encouraging a decrease in food consumption.\u201d Semaglutide \u2013 sold under the brand names Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus \u2013 is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, a family of medications that help manage blood sugar. Wegovy is recommended to help obese adults lose weight on the NHS by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Last year, NHS England revealed hospital admissions of obese youngsters under the age of 17 had tripled in a decade, growing from 3,370 in 2011/12 to 9,431 in 2021/22. Globally, obesity rates among teenagers globally have quadrupled since 1990, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Figures released in March showed there were more than 390 million overweight youngsters aged five to 19 in 2022, included 160 million who were classed as obese. Prof Baur added: \u201cThere is a growing evidence base for some obesity management medications in adolescents \u2013 however no evidence exists yet for use in younger children aged under 12 years, but use may be justified in those younger children with more severe obesity.\u201d She warned that weight loss drugs must be combined with lifestyle changes \u201cin all cases\u201d. \u201cIt is clear from our experience with adults that long-term use will most probably be needed, but further evidence is needed on this,\u201d she said. \u201cMore evidence is also needed for use of these medications in adolescents for maintenance therapy, pre-treatment for surgery, post-surgery treatment, combination therapy, and the use of medication with other obesity therapies. \u201cYet as we have found with adults, the cost and availability of these medications are a major barrier in every country.\u201d", "summary": "Globally, obesity rates among teenagers globally have quadrupled since 1990, according to the World Health Organisation.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/world-health-organisation-obesity-wegovy-australia-nhs-england-b1167597.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/11/23/10133216-719a3f6b-faf0-4ec9-9b01-cedb807c1815.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:14:24", "author": "Storm Newton", "authors": ["Storm Newton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.056}

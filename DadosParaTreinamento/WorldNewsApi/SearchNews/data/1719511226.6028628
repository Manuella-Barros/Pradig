Kabiyesi Alayeluwa Oba Saheed Ademola Elegushi (Kusenla III) has asked Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State to call the General Manager of Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Mr. Gbolahan Oki to order. Barr. Omotayo, who is also the lawyer of Mr. Ijeoma Daniel Eboagwu/Mrs. Paulyn Onosetale Eboagwu, raised an alarm on Sunday, alleging that an Indian company Chronodexia Inv. Nigeria is using the Lagos State government officials under the auspices of Oki led LASBCA to wrestle land from her clients. Omotayo in an electronic mail sent to our correspondent said the land grabbing issue which began in 2023 climaxed on Friday 24th May 2024, where she stated that after the payment of all prescribed fees to ministry of physical planning and LASBCA, consequent upon which LASBCA gave its approval, the property was demolished of Friday. She said: \u201cI was surprised when sometime in 2023 I was informed that the Indian company had petitioned my client for an encroachment on its land. \u201cWhen we met at the ministry of physical planning, I presented the governor\u2019s consent, which my client has. And the Indian has no document to back up its claim. That was around June 2023. Again, in July, they showed up again with the false claim, and we presented our documents, and they left. \u201cIn December 2023, the GM of LASBCA led about 200 thugs wearing T-shirts of Lagos State government. When we confronted them with our valid documents, they left. She added, \u201cI was surprised that an Indian company could be using the Lagos State government to wrestle land from the genuine owners with valid documents. \u201cOn Friday 24th May, 2024, Oki came again with thugs numbering about 200 with the Indians and started to demolish the building. Nobody was allowed to move near the site, let alone show them the documents. \u201cAt about 6 pm, Chief Segun Elegushi, Opeoluwa of Ikateland, who was in charge of the area, visited the site. He spoke with the LASBCA officials and left. At about 250m from the scene, he was accosted and tear-gassed. His chief security officer who challenged the assailants was arrested and handcuffed like a common criminal. He has since been detained at Alausa,\u201dshe said. Omotayo said it\u2019s shocking that after spending close to N50m to process all the documents with approval from LASBCA, its GM, had the effrontery to demolish a building with valid papers without court judgment nor demolition notice. According to her, the value of the building is conservatively put at N3.5bn. She was particularly piqued that Elegushi\u2019s uncle was attacked and brutalised in that manner. \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable that a 76-year-old man will be brutalised in that manner,\u201d she added. Meanwhile, Chief Elegushi, also in an electronic mail sent to our correspondent, said he was surprised that the family could be treated by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in that shabby manner. The Opeoluwa of Ikateland, who was livid with anger over the treatment meted to him by Lagos State officials, called out Governor Sanwo-Olu for allowing him suffer such humiliation under his watch despite the support his younger brother, Alayeluwa Elegushi gave him before, during and after the 2023 gubernatorial elections. He, however, warned that the unruly behaviour of Oki wouldn\u2019t go unchallenged in court.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240525-WA0131.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240525-WA0131.jpg 1280w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240525-WA0131-300x225.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240525-WA0131-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240525-WA0131-768x576.jpg 768w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240525-WA0131-86x64.jpg 86w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></div>&#8230;Narrates How LABSCA Officials Pulled Down N3.5bn Property LAGOS &#8211; Mrs. Adepeju Omotayo, a lawyer to\u00a0 HRM.

I wanted to reinvent myself.\u201d And so the 55-year-old mother-of-three did just that. On Saturday, June 15, Siobh\u00e1n and four other brave women \u2014 Afric Creedon, Karen Molloy, Jackie O\u2019Connor and Orla Colreavy \u2014 swam a relay of the North Channel of the Irish Sea, from Donaghadee near Bangor in Northern Ireland to Scotland. \u2018There was no sun and it wasn\u2019t pleasant. The water was 11.8C. It was Baltic\u2019 Starting at 5.30am, they did the 42.2km swim in 12 hours, 19 minutes and 46 seconds. They were the 40th relay ever to do it. That\u2019s special. \u201cThe North Channel is known as the beast. It\u2019s one of the toughest swims,\u201d says Siobh\u00e1n. \u201cThe water is cold, 9C to 12C, and there are strong currents. There are jellyfish, but we decided to do it in June before the lion\u2019s mane jellyfish get there. They prefer warmer water. \u201cThe swim is unpredictable. Half way over the tide is going to turn, so you just get in and swim like the clappers.\u201d And they did \u2014 in ordinary swimsuits, one swimming cap each, goggles and no watch, in accordance with Irish Long Distance Swimming Association rules. They took it in turns to swim for an hour, observing strict rules about changeovers, not touching the boat while they swam. As well as the boat crew from the swim organisers at Infinity Channel Swimming, they brought an observer from the Irish Long Distance Swimming Association. When not in the water, each swimmer took turns to time a team-mate and write it on a board in 10-minute intervals. They would dangle this within the swimmer\u2019s eye-line. When one of them spotted that a swimmer was getting tired, she would draw a love heart beside the number. The relay was all about the team and supporting each other. Afric was first of the five into the water. \u201cThere was no sun and it wasn\u2019t pleasant,\u201d she says. \u201cThe temperature was 11.8C. It was Baltic. \"I was too cold to kick my legs, but I told the others that it wasn\u2019t that bad. I didn\u2019t want to put them off. \"I just thought of silly songs in my head \u2014 you tell yourself to keep on going. It really is mind over matter.\u201d In between swims, they helped each other get out of their wet togs fast, put on layers of warm clothes and sat in their dryrobes drinking tea and eating ham sandwiches and porridge. The North Channel is a massive challenge for anyone, but these five women faced it down. They range in age from 42 to 55, and four of them are mothers. When it comes to their swimming prowess, most of them are comeback kids. All swam in clubs as children, but most dropped out from the Leaving Cert onwards, if not earlier. In 1991, Siobh\u00e1n won the first-ever Ladies\u2019 Liffey Swim. But over the years they had all drifted away from their swimming lives. Things got busy and life got in the way. After college, marriage, kids and achieving some career goals, they finally got back in the water and started to swim seriously. \u2018I do all my best thinking in the water. The sea is an escape\u2019 For some of them, it started with wanting to get fit again, to feel strong and shed the baby weight. Along the way they got to know each other through doing Leinster Open Sea swims, and they all enjoyed the camaraderie at those events. Some are wives and mothers of young children. Karen is a solicitor, Orla works in mental health services, Siobh\u00e1n is a swimming teacher, Afric is a primary teacher and Jackie has just finished college for the second time. She re-trained as a primary teacher and is now looking for a teaching post. On Saturday, in between counting her strokes in the North Channel, she was rehearsing answers for her upcoming job interviews. \u201cI do all my best thinking in the water,\u201d she says. When she is in a bad mood, her husband tells her to go for a swim. \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on,\u201d says the mother of three young children. \u201cThe water is like an escape. It\u2019s just you and your thoughts. Then when I get out of the water, I\u2019m like a new person.\u201d Afric has a similar feeling. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in the water, nobody needs me, no one is calling me,\u201d she says. \u201cI teach senior infants, so there\u2019s a lot of \u2018Miss Creedon\u2019. But when I\u2019m in the sea, I can switch off.\u201d Somewhere in these women\u2019s busy lives, they made time to train. They all did it at different times, fitting it in around work, family commitments and their other activities. Some swam at dawn, some hung around a little after work to go training and others went late at night after they had put the kids to bed. They trained hard in the pool and swam in the sea at weekends all year, acclimatising themselves for the epic swim. \u2018When the sun shone, and I saw the rays in the dark green water, I thought how lucky I was\u2019 Karen has Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon which makes her fingers and toes numb with the cold. \u201cBut you get used to the cold. It\u2019s amazing how your body can acclimatise. \"You can push your own boundaries, but with Raynaud\u2019s I have to be careful not to overdo it. I\u2019m conscious not to let it get as far as the core,\u201d she says \u2014 and then tells me that last year she did the European Ice Swimming championships in Romania. Talk about toughness. Saturday was actually the first time all five women swam together \u2014 but such was the bond and trust between them, they were all ready. \u201cWe\u2019re all relaxed and easy-going,\u201d says Karen, who lives in Mayo. \u201cBut we all wanted it. This was important to us.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about doing it, but doing it in a good time,\u201d says Orla. This was her first time doing a channel relay. The other four swam the English Channel in 2023 with another swimmer, Yvonne McCarthy. They did the 32km from England to France in 11 hours, 39 minutes \u2014 an Irish record for the five fastest women. As well as being on that team, Karen did the North Channel last year, too. Being the new girl, Orla didn\u2019t want to let the others down. \u201cThis was more than just participating. It was about training hard, getting out of our comfort zone and pushing ourselves,\u201d says Orla. \u201cDoing it as a team is so enjoyable,\u201d says Karen. The most extraordinary thing about this magnificent feat is how unassuming they have been about the whole thing. Three of them are in my swimming club, NAC Masters, and after training sessions they might be happily chatting away in the changing room about swim suits and other mundane matters. Not a mention of gearing up for the North Channel and all the training they had done. I didn\u2019t tell anyone in work \u2013 talking about it would wreck my head Even now that it\u2019s done, many of them have yet to share their news. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone in work,\u201d says Orla. \u201cIt\u2019s such a long build-up and talking about it would wreck my head. \"Also, there was the danger that it mightn\u2019t happen at all, as it depends on tides and the wind. The waiting was the worst part. But I\u2019ll tell people now.\u201d In fact, she rhapsodises about it now. \u201cAt parts of the swim, it was very cold and there was a lot of chop and you\u2019d feel the swell. You\u2019re swimming in a depth of 300 metres,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when the sun shone, and you could see the rays on the dark green water, I thought how lucky I was to be doing this. What a privilege. \u201cOn the boat on the way back from Scotland, everyone was very quiet \u2014 but inside we were smiling. We were relieved we got through it, and felt a massive sense of accomplishment.\u201d They are all so appreciative of their husbands and families who supported them along the way. Some of them decided to fundraise for charity through the swim (you can contribute on North Channel Relay Swim 2024 iDonate). Karen raised money for the Parkinson\u2019s Ireland charity. Her late father \u2014 who instilled in her the love of swimming \u2014 got Parkinson\u2019s disease in his 50s. She knows how much he would love to be swimming, so she thought of him when she agreed to do the swim. She says it was something she knew she had to do. \u201cWhen these opportunities present themselves, you\u2019ve got to grab them with both hands.\u201d The swim relay raised funds for three charities.

Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said members aren't even 'in the same book' let alone on the same page, though he position on the president has remained unclear.\n\nOn Wednesday Nancy Pelosi - a staunch Biden ally - sent shockwaves through the party by stopping short of telling Biden he should stay in the race, and suggested he should reconsider.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night, Colorado's Democratic Senator warned Biden is heading for a 'landslide' defeat in the general election if nothing changes.\n\nTheir statements mirror the fears by many that Biden could lead them into a disaster in November - in the general election and their own races.\n\nJust seven House Democrats have come out publicly to say Biden should step aside, while dozens have shared their worries in secret. Some won't go further than saying they are listening to voters concerns.\n\nThe question that Democrats have so far failed to answer as a unit is: Do they stick with the languishing man with a 50-year Washington career who has beaten Donald Trump before, or do they dump him to avoid their worst nightmare in November.\n\nAlmost all of the Democrat's concerns relate to President Biden's apparent cognitive decline, which both he and the White House have furiously denied.\n\nOne of the most senior Democrats in the nation, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, is standing with the embattled president.\n\nBut he is facing mounting pressure from members running for election in their districts in November who believe Biden could cost them victory.\n\nThe progressive wing of the party are standing firmly behind Biden.\n\nAOC told DailyMail.com on Monday she is backing Biden: 'The matter is closed.' Black Democrats are also mostly in his corner.\n\nRegardless, hundreds of Democrats still have to reveal where they stand - whether for their own future or the party's.\n\nDailyMail.com breaks down all the Democrats who have publicly called for Biden to drop out, those who have flipped and the others who simply won't say.\n\nSeven House Democrats have publicly stated it is time to move on from Biden.\n\nAdam Smith, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, is the most senior party member to come forward.\n\nThe Washington lawmaker told DailyMail.com he was concerned about Biden's cognitive abilities before the debate.\n\nHe doubled down on calls for Joe to be replaced as Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J became the seventh House Democrat to call for his ousting.\n\nThey followed a handful of colleagues who broke ranks with Biden. The first was Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett.\n\nOn July 2, just five days after Biden's CNN debate, Doggett released a statement calling on the president to withdraw from the race.\n\nDoggett, a veteran Democrat who has served since 1995, said Biden had fulfilled his pledge to be to be a 'transitional' candidate, and it was time for him to let someone else take the reins.\n\nA day later on July 3, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona told the New York Times he too believes Joe Biden should drop out of the race.\n\n'If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere,' Grijalva said.\n\n'What he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat -- and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.'\n\nThe next day Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Seth Moulton also called on Biden to withdraw.\n\n'President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington's footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,' he told local outlet WBUR.\n\nOn July 5, Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois went on MSNBC - one of the president's favorite networks - to call on Biden to withdraw.\n\nAdditionally, on July 6, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig posted on X she wants Biden out too.\n\n'President Biden is a good man & I appreciate his lifetime of service,' she wrote. 'But I believe he should step aside for the next generation of leadership. The stakes are too high.'\n\nOn Sunday the dam protecting Biden as the presumptive nominee cracked further.\n\nDemocrat Reps. Mark Takano of California, Jerry Nadler and Joe Morelle of New York, and Smith all privately expressed on the conference how they want to see Biden step aside.\n\nNadler then flipped and said he would be backing the president, but for the rest their minds were made up.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of swing-district Democrats against Biden's reelection held a meeting about their support of the president.\n\n'There were actual tears from people, and not for Biden,' a source told Axios of the meeting in which members were firmly against the president.\n\nAfter the Democrats' Tuesday morning meeting at their committee headquarters, many who had called on Biden to withdraw were more subdued than their announcements might have suggested.\n\nDemocrats backing Biden's 2024 reelection bid:\n\nIn total there are roughly 30 Democrat lawmakers that have firmly said they are on team Biden.\n\nThat still leaves more than 150 who are either on the fence or having publicly commented.\n\nSome of these lawmakers include heavy hitters like South Carolina powerbroker Rep. Jim Clyburn.\n\nThe list also boasts several senators, unlike the list of defectors which is comprised solely of House Democrats.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran against Biden for the Democratic party nominee in 2020, California Senators Laphonza Butler and Alex Padilla, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman all have come out in favor of the president's reelection gambit.\n\nUndecided Democrats and those who want Biden to prove himself:\n\nThere are also around 10 lawmakers who are unsure whether they want Joe to step aside and others who want to see the president prove himself.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, for example, recently said he loves Biden and that he needs to do more to convince voters of his ability in the same interview.\n\n'Personally, I love Joe Biden,' Murphy told CNN before addressing whether the president's interview with ABC last week quelled voter's concerns.\n\n'I think the president needs to do more. I'm not advising this campaign, but if I were, I would probably suggest that the president get out there and do a town hall, that he do a press conference, and that he show the country that he is still the old Joe Biden.'\n\nMurphy's declaration of love for the president coupled with his call on Biden 'to do more' serves as a confusing middle-ground some Democrats find themselves in.\n\nThis grey zone requires not throwing Biden under the bus, but not providing a full-throated endorsement of the elderly executive either.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, when pressed on the Democrat best fit to lead the party in November, said, 'I don't think we know that yet.'\n\n'I think everybody is waiting for the dust to settle from the aftermath of the debate,' he continued.\n\nThough he lauded the president's ability to 'speak extemporaneously without a teleprompter or cue cards' and that he 'can interact with the public in various settings in an expressive way,' Connolly said he will be keeping a keen eye on Biden's performance in coming weeks as an indicator for whether he is fit for reelection.\n\n'If he can't do that, then I think we are looking at some very hard judgments and hard choices we're going to have to face as a party,' Connolly continued.\n\nThe CBC Chair Stevens Horsfor, D-Nev., came out of his call with the president bullish on Biden.\n\n'I listened to my constituents during the district work period. I'm not going to judge the president on a 90-minute debate,' he said.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

President Biden is holding several campaign events in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. The campaign events come as calls to end his re-election bid continue after an unfavorable debate performance. Credit - Michael M. Santiago-Getty Images\n\nMultiple House Democrats joined calls for President Joe Biden to hand over his candidacy for the U.S. election to another candidate during a private meeting on Sunday with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, according to U.S. media reports.\n\nDuring the Zoom call, promoted as a \"listening session\" by Jeffries, senior Democrats discussed possible ways to convince Biden that he should step aside in the aftermath of a debate performance that was widely criticized and labeled as a \"bad night\" by Biden himself.\n\nRead More: Inside Biden's Debate Disaster\n\nAccording to reports by CBS and the New York Times, the House Democrats that said Biden should leave the race included Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, who serves as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee; Rep. Mark Takano of California, who serves as the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee; Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, who serves as the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Effective Foreign Assistance; and Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, who serves as the ranking member of the Committee on House Administration. Other representatives on the call also expressed skepticism about the President's chances of winning a second election against former President Donald Trump, according to both outlets.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, who serves as the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, also voiced support for Biden to step aside. The New York Times and CBS reported, however, that Himes expressed concern for Biden's electoral chances but did not say he called for the President to make way for another candidate.

Adam Smith from the state of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. \"Since the debate, the president has not seriously addressed these concerns.\"\n\nAngie Craig from Minnesota said in a statement that she does not believe Biden can win a rematch against Trump given his poor debate performance as well as his \"lack of a forceful response\" after the debate.\n\n\"This is not a decision I've come to lightly, but there's simply too much at stake to risk a second Donald Trump presidency,\" said Craig.\n\nArizona Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva last week urged Biden to withdraw. He qualified his remarks to the New York Times by saying he would support Biden if he decided to continue running but questioned whether the president could beat Trump in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\n\"What he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat, and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race,\" said Grijalva.\n\nNew Jersey's congressman Mikie Sherrill also encouraged Biden to not run again because the threat of another Trump term in office is \"too real.\"\n\n\"And because I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won't run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee,\" said Sherrill.\n\nMike Quigley from Illinois told MSNBC last week that Biden had nothing left to prove and should withdraw from the race.\n\n\"Mr. President, your legacy is set ... we owe you the greatest debt of gratitude,\" said Quigley. \"The only thing that you can do now to cement that for all time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this.\"\n\nMassachusetts Rep.

Lloyd Doggett was the first sitting member of Congress to call for Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race.\n\n\"I represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson. Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw,\" Doggett said in a statement last week. \"President Biden should do the same.\"\n\nThree other Democratic congressmen -- New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, and California Rep. Mark Takano, the top Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee -- also urged Biden to drop out of the race.\n\nNadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, however, seemed to backtrack on his initial comments to the New York Times about concerns regarding the president's reelection bid.\n\n\"He's going to be our nominee,\" Nadler said, referring to Biden, \"And we all have to support him.\"\n\n1st senator questions Biden candidacy\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet was the first Democratic US Senator to voice concerns about Biden's reelection chances versus Trump, saying he believed the Democrats would lose the election if Biden stayed on the ticket. Although Bennet stopped short of calling for Biden to withdraw, he said that he believed Trump and the Republicans are currently on track to win by a landslide.\n\n\"So for me, this isn't a question about polling, it's not a question of politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country,\" said Bennet.\n\nMeantime, a caucus of about 60 Democratic politicians reportedly backed the president during a conference call Monday, according to media outlets.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer from New York was adamant about his support of Biden.\n\n\"I'm with Joe,\" said Schumer.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from California did not give a direct answer when asked if Biden should stay on the ticket.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide,\" Pelosi told MSNBC. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision

Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said members aren't even 'in the same book' let alone on the same page, though he position on the president has remained unclear.\n\nOn Wednesday Nancy Pelosi - a staunch Biden ally - sent shockwaves through the party by stopping short of telling Biden he should stay in the race, and suggested he should reconsider.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night, Colorado's Democratic Senator warned Biden is heading for a 'landslide' defeat in the general election if nothing changes.\n\nDemocrat lawmakers have not been able to come to a consensus on whether they believe President Joe Biden should remain the party's presidential nominee since his disastrous presidential debate performance against Donald Trump which raised questions about whether he has the mental and physical ability to run the country for another four years\n\nTheir statements mirror the fears by many that Biden could lead them into a disaster in November - in the general election and their own races.\n\nJust seven House Democrats have come out publicly to say Biden should step aside, while dozens have shared their worries in secret. Some won't go further than saying they are listening to voters concerns.\n\nRead More Biden, 81, phones into TV show and insists he 'doesn't care' about calls to drop out\n\nThe question that Democrats have so far failed to answer as a unit is: Do they stick with the languishing man with a 50-year Washington career who has beaten Donald Trump before, or do they dump him to avoid their worst nightmare in November.\n\nAlmost all of the Democrat's concerns relate to President Biden's apparent cognitive decline, which both he and the White House have furiously denied.\n\nOne of the most senior Democrats in the nation, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, is standing with the embattled president.\n\nBut he is facing mounting pressure from members running for election in their districts in November who believe Biden could cost them victory.\n\nThe progressive wing of the party are standing firmly behind Biden.\n\nAOC told DailyMail.com on Monday she is backing Biden: 'The matter is closed.' Black Democrats are also mostly in his corner.\n\nDemocrats calling on Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election\n\nLloyd Doggett, Texas\n\nRa\u00fal Grijalva, Arizona\n\nSeth Moulton, Massachusetts\n\nMike Quigley, Illinois\n\nAngie Craig, Minnesota\n\nAdam Smith, Washington\n\nMikie Sherrill, New Jersey\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless, hundreds of Democrats still have to reveal where they stand - whether for their own future or the party's.\n\nDailyMail.com breaks down all the Democrats who have publicly called for Biden to drop out, those who have flipped and the others who simply won't say.\n\nThe Democrats who have called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race:\n\nSeven House Democrats have publicly stated it is time to move on from Biden.\n\nAdam Smith, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, is the most senior party member to come forward.\n\nThe Washington lawmaker told DailyMail.com he was concerned about Biden's cognitive abilities before the debate.\n\nHe doubled down on calls for Joe to be replaced as Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J became the seventh House Democrat to call for his ousting.\n\nThey followed a handful of colleagues who broke ranks with Biden. The first was Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett.\n\nOn July 2, just five days after Biden's CNN debate, Doggett released a statement calling on the president to withdraw from the race.\n\nDoggett, a veteran Democrat who has served since 1995, said Biden had fulfilled his pledge to be to be a 'transitional' candidate, and it was time for him to let someone else take the reins.\n\nA day later on July 3, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona told the New York Times he too believes Joe Biden should drop out of the race.\n\n'If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere,' Grijalva said.\n\nTexas Rep. Lloyd Doggett was the first sitting Democrat in office to call for Joe Biden to get out of the presidential race. He said Democrat leadership did not try to keep him quiet\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, D-Ariz., became the second sitting Democrat to publicly call for President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election\n\n'What he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat -- and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.'\n\nThe next day Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Seth Moulton also called on Biden to withdraw.\n\n'President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington's footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,' he told local outlet WBUR.\n\nOn July 5, Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois went on MSNBC - one of the president's favorite networks - to call on Biden to withdraw.\n\nAdditionally, on July 6, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig posted on X she wants Biden out too.\n\n'President Biden is a good man & I appreciate his lifetime of service,' she wrote. 'But I believe he should step aside for the next generation of leadership. The stakes are too high.'\n\nOn Sunday the dam protecting Biden as the presumptive nominee cracked further.\n\nDemocrat Reps. Mark Takano of California, Jerry Nadler and Joe Morelle of New York, and Smith all privately expressed on the conference how they want to see Biden step aside.\n\nNadler then flipped and said he would be backing the president, but for the rest their minds were made up.\n\nOn a private phone call Sunday, many Democrats, including Reps. Craig and Nadler (shown above), expressed how they want to see Biden withdraw from the race. Nadler later said Tuesday he is with Biden\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of swing-district Democrats against Biden's reelection held a meeting about their support of the president.\n\n'There were actual tears from people, and not for Biden,' a source told Axios of the meeting in which members were firmly against the president.\n\nAfter the Democrats' Tuesday morning meeting at their committee headquarters, many who had called on Biden to withdraw were more subdued than their announcements might have suggested.\n\nDemocrats backing Biden's 2024 reelection bid:\n\nIn total there are roughly 30 Democrat lawmakers that have firmly said they are on team Biden.\n\nThat still leaves more than 150 who are either on the fence or having publicly commented.\n\nSome of these lawmakers include heavy hitters like South Carolina powerbroker Rep. Jim Clyburn.\n\nThe list also boasts several senators, unlike the list of defectors which is comprised solely of House Democrats.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran against Biden for the Democratic party nominee in 2020, California Senators Laphonza Butler and Alex Padilla, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman all have come out in favor of the president's reelection gambit.\n\nImmediately after the two presidents debated, criticism from inside the Democrat party aimed at Joe Biden began circulating on social media and cable news\n\nUndecided Democrats and those who want Biden to prove himself:\n\nThere are also around 10 lawmakers who are unsure whether they want Joe to step aside and others who want to see the president prove himself.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, for example, recently said he loves Biden and that he needs to do more to convince voters of his ability in the same interview.\n\n'Personally, I love Joe Biden,' Murphy told CNN before addressing whether the president's interview with ABC last week quelled voter's concerns.\n\n'I think the president needs to do more. I'm not advising this campaign, but if I were, I would probably suggest that the president get out there and do a town hall, that he do a press conference, and that he show the country that he is still the old Joe Biden.'\n\nMurphy's declaration of love for the president coupled with his call on Biden 'to do more' serves as a confusing middle-ground some Democrats find themselves in.\n\nThis grey zone requires not throwing Biden under the bus, but not providing a full-throated endorsement of the elderly executive either.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, when pressed on the Democrat best fit to lead the party in November, said, 'I don't think we know that yet.'\n\n'I think everybody is waiting for the dust to settle from the aftermath of the debate,' he continued.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did an exclusive interview with ABC News as calls for him to withdraw from the election grew louder\n\nThough he lauded the president's ability to 'speak extemporaneously without a teleprompter or cue cards' and that he 'can interact with the public in various settings in an expressive way,' Connolly said he will be keeping a keen eye on Biden's performance in coming weeks as an indicator for whether he is fit for reelection.\n\n'If he can't do that, then I think we are looking at some very hard judgments and hard choices we're going to have to face as a party,' Connolly continued.\n\nThe CBC Chair Stevens Horsfor, D-Nev., came out of his call with the president bullish on Biden.\n\n'I listened to my constituents during the district work period. I'm not going to judge the president on a 90-minute debate,' he said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That's the way it's supposed to work,\" he said, clarifying that he does not advocate for Biden's resignation before the end of his term.\n\nDespite these growing calls, Biden and his campaign remain steadfast.

Chris Murphy, an ambitious young Democrat from Connecticut, went on television Sunday with a carefully worded warning to President Joe Biden about the viability of his campaign.\n\n\"This week is going to be absolutely critical; I think the president needs to do more,\" Murphy said, arguing that Biden needed to hold a town hall and participate in unscripted events because \"the clock is ticking\" for him to put to rest the doubts about his candidacy raised by a disastrous debate performance. Multiple times, Murphy emphasized his deadline, saying that he, as well as voters, must see more action \"this week.\"\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who briefly ran for president himself, said Biden had to \"reassure the American people that he can run a vigorous campaign to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, a senior member of the Democratic leadership team, put out a statement that passed for fighting words, saying that the president \"must do more to demonstrate that he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nSo far, Biden has done none of that.\n\nAnd yet, Democrats on Capitol Hill are stifling their doubts and falling in line behind him anyway.\n\nHaving spent the last week and a half in various stages of private panic and public skepticism about Biden's viability as a candidate and whispering among themselves about what the best way to push him aside might be -- a strongly worded letter? a White House meeting? a high-level intervention? -- top Democrats on Tuesday settled on a strategy many of them conceded could be disastrous: They would do nothing, at least for now.\n\n\"As I've said before, I'm with Joe,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, said multiple times at a news conference after a closed-door Senate lunch. The lunch gave Democrats their first opportunity after a weeklong recess to gather in person and discuss how aggressive or public they wanted to be in standing up to a defiant party leader who has unequivocally refused to step aside on his own.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, explicitly told colleagues on a private call Sunday afternoon that Biden should withdraw from the race. But by Tuesday, as he made his way into a House caucus meeting, he was backtracking, saying that any concerns he harbored were \"beside the point\" and that Biden was \"going to be our nominee, and we all have to support him.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., left the Senate lunch arguing that Biden and only Biden would decide his future, and that it was not up to Congress to pressure him out of the race.\n\n\"He has my support, and I think he is right now the only one who will decide whether he continues to be the candidate,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nNever mind that Biden had done almost none of the kind of unscripted events, town halls or interviews his critics had said he needed to in order to show that he was still fit to run. He was not scheduled to until Thursday, when he is set to participate in a preplanned NATO news conference.\n\nInstead, a defiant letter Biden sent to lawmakers Monday in which he refused to drop out of the race -- coupled with members of the influential Congressional Black Caucus vociferously rallying to his side -- appeared to have successfully paralyzed the entire party into a state of uncertainty and inaction during what it had deemed to be the critical week.\n\nLongtime party loyalists said they were now reduced to hoping for another major public misstep by Biden, such as a serious stumble at his NATO news conference, to either persuade reticent members of Congress to speak out or to convince the president that he should leave the race on his own.\n\nThe stance struck the lone-wolf Democrats who have stuck their necks out to publicly call for Biden to step aside as preposterous -- and even dangerous.\n\n\"The idea that we are going to slow-walk into fascism because we don't want to hurt somebody that we respect's feelings -- I cannot even begin to tell you how angry that makes me,\" said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee and one of seven House Democrats to publicly call on Biden to step aside.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Bennet stopped short of publicly calling on Biden to end his campaign. But in an interview on CNN, he confirmed that he told his colleagues during the closed-door Senate lunch that he did not think Biden could beat Trump. \"I think we could lose the whole thing,\" he said, referring to the White House as well as both chambers of Congress.\n\nHe added, \"The White House has done nothing since the debate to demonstrate they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\nPrivately, vulnerable Democrats who represent competitive districts were panicking that there appeared to be no plan to pressure Biden out of what they expected to be a losing proposition for all of them. Behind closed doors, there was a consensus forming among the members in the toughest House seats that Democrats would have a much better shot of winning the majority with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.\n\nTheir position was expressed privately to Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the minority leader, who was still in listening mode Tuesday, debating how to proceed.\n\n\"I think he's thinking about logistics and practicality and how do you get all of this done?\" said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nPublicly, Jeffries toed the party line. \"I made it clear publicly the day after the debate that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket,\" he told reporters Monday. \"My position has not changed.\"\n\nWaters said it was up to Congress to help Biden win the election.\n\n\"We have not sufficiently educated people as to his accomplishments,\" she said. \"We all need to do a better job of that.\"\n\nYet the consensus among many Democratic lawmakers was that Biden himself was the problem. Their unwillingness to say so was reminiscent of how congressional Republicans behaved during Trump's presidency, when they would criticize and mock him privately but profess total fealty in public -- or simply avert their gaze from his latest incendiary missive.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., said it was destructive to call for Biden to step aside if he declined to leave voluntarily, adding that Democrats had to \"make the best of a complicated situation.\"\n\n\"Those publicly calling on President Biden to withdraw should ask themselves a simple question,\" Torres told CNN. \"What if the president becomes the Democratic nominee?\"\n\nFor now, top Democrats have no appetite for breaking with him. In a statement provided to The New York Times, Schumer said, \"I'm working overtime with the Biden campaign and my colleagues to win the presidency and maintain the Democratic majority in the Senate.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5,

In an extraordinary development, as of Wednesday at 2 p.m. Eastern, 10 Democratic members of Congress have either publicly called on Biden to drop out or reportedly did so in a private meeting and haven't refuted the story. Another 37 have expressed concerns about Biden as the nominee but stopped short of saying he should drop out. (These numbers are based on VoteHub's excellent tracker of Democrats' stances on Biden, supplemented by reporting from ABC News.)\n\nHowever, even more Democratic members of Congress have rallied to Biden's side. Since the debate, 89 have made public statements saying they still support Biden as the nominee -- most of them in the last few days. The rush of support has been a godsend for Biden as he attempts to save his candidacy. The question of whether he will step aside is likely to continue to dog the president, with Democrats seemingly in disagreement over the best way forward, but for now it appears Biden has every intention of staying in this race.\n\nSo which Democrats are speaking out on this issue and why? At first blush, there may not seem to be much of a pattern in who is calling on Biden to step down and who is standing by his side. But a closer look reveals there are some similarities within these two groups, which may help explain why Biden is hanging on for now.\n\nThe Democrats who have explicitly called on Biden to step aside are an eclectic bunch. They actually hail from all three clusters of the party, as defined by an analysis 538 conducted in May: three Progressive Democrats, four Core Democrats and three Moderate Democrats. They range in age from 42 (Rep. Pat Ryan) to 77 (Rep. Lloyd Doggett). Most hail from safe Democratic seats, but two (Ryan and Rep. Angie Craig) are vulnerable for reelection. And most are white, but one (Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva) is Hispanic and one (Rep. Mark Takano) is Asian American.\n\nHowever, if we include Democrats who have merely expressed concerns about Biden's candidacy, a clearer pattern emerges. This group is significantly more moderate than the Democratic caucus as a whole; their average DW-NOMINATE score is -0.319. (DW-NOMINATE is a measure of ideology based on roll-call votes, where 1 represents the most conservative and -1 represents the most liberal. The average Democratic member of Congress has a DW-NOMINATE score of -0.376.)\n\nBiden doubters also hail disproportionately from swing states or districts. Thirteen out of 37 represent places that Biden lost in 2020 or won by fewer than 10 percentage points. This makes sense when you think about it: The reelection of representatives like Rep. Susan Wild could hinge on how well the Democratic presidential nominee does in their districts, and they may fear that Biden will drag them down with him if he loses big. And for others on this list, such as Sen. Jon Tester, expressing concerns about Biden's age could be part of an overall strategy to distance themselves from a president who will probably lose in their home constituency.\n\nBy contrast, pore over the list of the Democrats who stand with Biden. They are relatively progressive, with an average DW-NOMINATE score of -0.415. (In fact, none of them hail from the 538-defined Moderate Democrats cluster of the party.) Their states and districts, on average, voted for Biden in 2020 by 36 points; in other words, most of these members are more at risk from a primary challenge than from losing a general election. (Indeed, the fear of facing a pro-Biden challenger may be part of what kept them in line.) And, perhaps most importantly, they are much more racially diverse: only 38 percent white. (Interestingly, though, they're not significantly older than anti-Biden or Biden-skeptical Democrats, so apparently this isn't a generational divide.)\n\nFor now, this list also includes the most powerful Democratic legislators in the country: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar.* Their opinions obviously carry more weight in Democratic politics than those of any of the people calling for Biden's withdrawal.\n\nMoreover, 37 Black senators and representatives have come out in support of Biden, making them a core part of his base of support. (By contrast, only one Black Democrat, Rep. Marc Veasey, has so much as expressed concerns about Biden's candidacy.) This mirrors Biden's historical support among Black voters: In many ways, they were responsible for delivering the Democratic nomination to Biden in 2020 when he won the South Carolina primary after poor finishes in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. So if Biden survives this political scare, he may once again have the support of the Black community to thank.\n\nTo be sure, it would be a political crisis for Biden to have even one elected Democrat saying he should drop out, let alone 10. Voters pay attention to elite opinions. But the weight of 10 -- or 47, if you count those with concerns -- dissenters is still not necessarily enough to force him from the race. For proof of this, look no further than the 2016 presidential campaign, when at least 24 Republican representatives and 15 Republican senators called on Trump to drop out, asked him to reconsider his candidacy or said they would not support him after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape surfaced. Trump obviously not only stayed in that race -- he won.\n\nBiden is certainly not guaranteed that happy of an ending (although his chances of winning the election, even after that debate performance, are hardly zero). But the quality and quantity of Democrats staying in his corner will make it easier for him to at least stay in the race.\n\n*Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi was on this list too, until Wednesday morning, when she said, \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\" That implies that she'll back whatever Biden decides to do, but it also implies she doesn't accept his insistence that he's not dropping out as the final word.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Which sucks for our country.\" --  an unnamed House Democrat speaking to Axios after attending a meeting with a small group of swing-district Democrats\n\nDemocrats are having a pretty miserable week -- and it's only Wednesday. Since President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance two weeks ago, the party has been in a tizzy trying to figure out whether he should remain their nominee for the 2024 ticket or exit the race. And a small group of Democrats desperate to replace Biden are frustrated about how things are going.\n\n\"Most of our caucus is with him ... meaning he'll stay in. Which sucks for our country,\" an anonymous House Democrat told Axios on Tuesday, right before the larger caucus met in a meeting described as a \"come-to-Jesus\" moment for Biden's candidacy.\n\nSo far, 10 Democrats have called on Biden to step aside and let a different, younger member of the party take on Donald Trump in November. Their efforts don't seem to be working, with Biden going on a media blitz to double down on his message: I am still running. In a prime-time interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Friday, Biden said he would only drop out of the presidential race if the \"Lord almighty\" told him to. Then he sent a letter to congressional Democrats that kicked off with \"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\" Shortly after that, Biden went on MSNBC's Morning Joe and said he believes voters still want him as their Democratic nominee, therefore he's not dropping out.\n\nBut some Democrats aren't buying this, acutely aware of just how alarming Biden's performance was in the debate and even in his recent media circuit, which was supposed to reinvigorate confidence but instead reinforced that Biden cannot communicate a coherent message. During a radio interview last week, the president said he was the \"first Black woman to serve with a Black president.\"\n\nHouse Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a progressive representing Arizona's 7District, told the New York Times he wants the party to draw a line with Biden now, adding that the stakes of this election are too high to risk him losing to an \"antidemocratic, authoritarian despot.\" Other Democrats have also tried to emphasize just how dire for democracy it would be if Biden were to lose to Trump. \"A second Trump term is a continuation of the last days of his first term, which is a nightmare in every respect,\" Mike Quigley, a House Democrat from Illinois, told MSNBC, referencing Jan. 6.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hinted in an interview with Morning Joe that she believes Biden should reevaluate his decision to run, but when pressed, she would not outright call for him to step aside as the party's nominee. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said, without actually saying what she would like Biden to do.\n\nBut party leaders are mostly ignoring these calls and sticking by Biden, despite the risks. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on Capitol Hill they were unequivocally on Team Biden -- despite Democratic House members privately telling Jeffries they want Biden to drop out. In a surprising but strategic decision, even Congress' progressive Squad members are sticking by the 81-year-old president. \"Joe Biden is our nominee. He is not leaving this race. He is in this race and I support him,\" Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters this week.\n\nSince the Biden-Trump debate, the president has consistently been trailing Trump in the polls. New Cook Political data shows Biden is losing at least three battleground states, all while a 59-year-old Black and Asian woman vice president is forced to sit on the sidelines and watch a historic opportunity become one of the messiest episodes for the Democratic Party in decades. And that does, truly, suck for our country.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shirin_ali@slate.com", "name": "Shirin Ali", "type":

Washington, his own party is in crisis mode weighing whether to jettison Biden as their election candidate.\n\nMost top Democrats have so far publicly rallied behind Biden but the party remains divided over a debate performance watched by some 51mn Americans.\n\nThe leader of the Democratic minority in the US House, Hakeem Jeffries, huddled with members from districts where fears over Biden's age -- exacerbated by his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump -- threaten their seats in November.\n\nOne participating lawmaker, speaking to US media on condition of anonymity, described the meeting as \"intense,\" with another member saying the mood was \"pretty much unanimous\" that Biden should step down.\n\n\"He just has to step down,\" House Democrat Mike Quigley told CNN on the way into Tuesday's meeting.\n\nBut in the party's full caucus meeting later Tuesday there were signs that Biden was able to firm up some support, with several lawmakers walking past rows of reporters and declaring their allegiance to the president.\n\nJerry Nadler, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, backed Biden despite having reportedly said at the weekend that he should step aside.\n\n\"He said he's going to remain in, he's our candidate, and we're all going to support him -- hopefully we're all going to support him,\" Nadler told reporters.\n\nBiden is committed to serving a full second term if reelected, the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\nThe president spoke by phone with the influential Congressional Black Caucus late

Jerry Nadler Calls For Biden To Step Down\n\nAnd today he is now saying \"We have to support Joe Biden!\"\n\nGee, what changed Nads?\n\nWho came to see you?\n\nHere's the tune he was singing just one day ago:\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler Calls For Biden To Step Down\n\nThe chorus of Democrats calling for Joe Biden to step down continues to increase....\n\nThe latest to call for his step down (or removal) is Jerry \"I don't know how to properly wear pants\" Nadler.\n\nTake a look:\n\nIn fact, Nadler is only one of four new Democrats to call for Biden to step down.\n\nThe other three are Adam Smith, Mark Takana and Joe Morelle:\n\nHere's more from Politico:\n\nSeveral more senior House Democrats called on President Joe Biden to abandon his reelection bid during a private call convened by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday afternoon, according to several people participating.\n\nAmong those forcefully calling for Biden to stand down during the nearly two-hour call were Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Adam Smith (D-Wash.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), according to two people familiar with the private session.\n\nOther members on the call voiced concerns about Biden's path to November, including Reps. Jim Himes (Conn.), Zoe Lofgren (Calif.), Don Beyer (Va.) and Rick Larsen (Wash.). It's a poor omen for the Biden campaign as the entire Democratic elected apparatus prepares to return to Washington on Monday evening where lawmakers will face tough questioning about their party's standard-bearer.\n\nAaron Fritschner, Beyer's spokesperson, posted on X to push back on reports that Beyer called for a new nominee: \"To be clear [Beyer] supports President Biden and said so on this call and any reporting to the contrary is a misunderstanding of what he said and what he believes.\"\n\nThe additional calls for Biden to stand aside from senior Democrats come after the president's interview last week with ABC News did nothing to assuage concerns among rank-and-file lawmakers about his continued viability in the race. Members have repeatedly urged the president to quickly schedule more unscripted events and town halls to continually demonstrate his vitality and energy.\n\nIt's not just the House either. A group of Senate Democrats are reportedly planning a discussion of Biden's path forward, led by Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), once that chamber returns to Washington on Monday. Five House Democrats have publicly urged Biden to stand down, while numerous others have expressed concerns about his viability in private.\n\nAnd if you think I'm only covering this to give myself an excuse to revisit Jerry Nadler crapping his pants live on stage and being seemingly incapable of wearing pants correctly.....you'd be 100% correct.\n\nRemember The Time Jerry Nadler Crapped His Pants LIVE On Stage?\n\nIt's Friday afternoon so we're having a little fun around here....\n\nFlashback Fridays!\n\nI hope this brings a smile to your face.\n\nDoes anyone else remember the time Jerry Nadler crapped his pants live on stage and then had to awkwardly waddle off?

As time continues, it doesn't seem like the president has the support he needs from his own party, but Jeffries' stamp of approval could be the one thing that changes the tide of the election.\n\nAs of July 10, seven House Democrats have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the presidential race, according to Associated Press, suggesting the Democratic party is not as strong as they need to be heading into November. Most recently, New York Rep. Jerry Nadler took back his initial stance that Biden should drop out. He spoke to reporters before entering a closed door meeting at the Democrats' national headquarters. \"Whether or not I have concerns is besides the point,\" he said. \"[Biden] is going to be our nominee and we all have to support him.\" Biden has repeatedly stated that he will continue to run, and that he still believes he can defeat Trump.\n\nBut his support is clearly shaky, and now, Democrats need Jeffries to take a stance. The House Minority Leader has two choices: either come out and tell Biden to pass the torch to a younger, fresher face, or fully support the president and call his fellow Democrats to do the same.\n\nAlthough Jeffries won't be the deciding factor on whether Biden stays or not, Democrats agree that as the House leader, Jeffries' decision has the ability to drastically sway members of the party either way.\n\n\"He's really good about laying out the facts and coming in and making people go in the direction that he wants them to go,\" said Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, a Biden loyalist, in an interview with CNN. \"I have confidence in him that he will talk to those individuals, and he will figure out how to stop the bleed and move us forward.\"\n\nEver since Biden's questionable performance at the presidential debate, Democrats, Republicans, and many voters are rethinking the 81-year-old's decision to run for reelection. During the recent Essence Festival, Vice President Kamala Harris called the upcoming election \"the most significant election of our lifetime\" before urging voters to choose for Biden.\n\nThe incumbent's defiant decision to see this race through could backfire in his face if he loses in November.

But the 81-year-old president has come under increasing pressure to yield his position, in particular after a poor showing in a debate last week.\n\nA Morelle spokesman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Immediately after the debate, Morelle told WXXI News that there were \"a lot of questions still to be answered\" regarding his candidacy.\n\n\"I wouldn't write Joe Biden off because of one bad performance,\" he said. \"By the same token, I think he has to make a decision, his family and his inner circle about whether they think he feels he can still fulfill his obligations.\"\n\nOther leading Democrats to express concern about Biden during the meeting included Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Jerrold Nadler, Adam Smith, Mark Takano, Jim Himes and Susan Wild.", "source": {"uri": "democratandchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democrat and Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

They're so worried they've been trying to convince the Biden team to pour resources into New York to shore up his campaign and boost Democrats running in a half-dozen swing districts that could determine control of the House.\n\nBiden aides have not focused on New York, committing no significant resources to a state where they expect the president to easily win all 28 electoral college votes in November.\n\nBut the warning signs are impossible to ignore and have been building over the past year. Two private polls conducted in a swing New York House district and reviewed by POLITICO -- one in September and another in March -- found former President Donald Trump leading Biden there by 1 point, a virtual tie. And public polls over the last four months found Biden's lead had winnowed to just 8 points across New York -- an unusually narrow gap in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1.\n\n\"We're still acting like this is a one-party state, which for pretty much 20, 25 years it has been,\" Democratic Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said. \"I truly believe we're a battleground state now.\"\n\nBiden, whose campaign is in free fall after a shambling debate performance last month, is yet to pay much attention to the state beyond high-dollar fundraisers. He was most recently in New York on June 29 to raise money in the Hamptons and attend a dedication ceremony for the Stonewall Inn Visitor Center in Manhattan a day earlier. He has been appearing in traditional battleground states, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania over the weekend, as the 81-year-old tries to silence doubts over his age and mental acuity.\n\nNow Democrats want Biden to get serious about the Empire State as they warn of the existential crisis to democracy posed by Trump's potential return to the White House, according to interviews with 10 Democratic Party officials, consultants and political leaders.\n\nA contested race in New York exacerbates Biden's reelection troubles as members of his party continue to call for him to step aside or question his fitness for office -- including two members of the state's House delegation. And it would cost him time and money he'd rather be spending on the country's six swing states, siphoning millions of dollars to play in the costliest media market in the country.\n\n\"The money that needs to be spent here will be subtracted from other areas he's going to lose,\" former Democratic New York Gov. David Paterson said.\n\nTop statewide Democrats -- including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries -- have signaled shared public support for Biden. Schumer, though, has been sparing in his public comments about Biden since the president's debate performance nearly two weeks ago.\n\n\"As I've said before, I'm with Joe,\" Schumer said Tuesday at his weekly press conference, repeating a version of a line he'd used previously.\n\nSchumer and Jeffries are under intense pressure this week as lawmakers return to the Capitol and Democrats try to find unity. Schumer declined Tuesday to say whether he agreed with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), another member of Democratic leadership, that Biden \"must do more\" to reassure Democrats and needs to be \"a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future.\"\n\nDemocrats have been on a winning streak in New York since 2006 and control all levers of power in Albany. A GOP presidential candidate hasn't won New York since Ronald Reagan's rout of Walter Mondale in 1984. But GOP candidates flipped enough suburban House seats to help their party maintain control of the chamber two years ago, as a Republican challenger to Gov. Kathy Hochul lost by a relatively modest 6 points.\n\nState party leaders have publicly backed Biden and expect he will remain in the race -- none more than Hochul. Still, support for Biden among New York Democrats behind closed doors is flagging. Reps. Jerry Nadler and Joe Morelle in a conference call with fellow House Democrats backed a change at the top of the ticket. Nadler publicly has said he's supporting Biden; Morelle did not return a call seeking comment.\n\nA weak Biden would spell trouble for down-ballot Democrats running in battleground House districts in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island -- particularly those who rely on increased turnout generated during a presidential election year.\n\n\"The implications for control of Congress are real enough that I think this needs more national attention,\" Levine said.\n\nFear among some Democrats has become so heightened that they are advising their party's candidates to all but disavow Biden on the campaign trail in order to bolster their own candidacies. And messaging on abortion rights or the threat Trump could pose to democracy -- issues expected to play to Biden's advantage -- may not be enough on their own, former Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said.\n\n\"If I'm a Democrat in some of these suburban races, I'd run the hell away from Joe Biden,\" she said.\n\nAnd one high-level New York Democrat, granted anonymity to speak bluntly about the political crisis surrounding the president, said the party's House candidates need to distance themselves from the top of the ticket.\n\n\"It's never been more important for a Democratic House member to focus on building their own local brand and to run on that,\" the person said. \"Biden isn't going to be handing out coattails no matter what. He's only got anchors.\"\n\nOne of Biden's New York labor allies has had trouble convincing some of his rank-and-file members to vote for the president despite the union's endorsement.\n\n\"There are going to be members, we recognize, who will never be convinced that Joe Biden is the next president,\" state Building and Construction Trades Council President Gary LaBarbera said. \"This is a very unique set of circumstances with Donald Trump. There are people who are just not going to change their minds.\"\n\nMisgivings among Democrats over Biden's waning support in New York go beyond the broader questions over his advanced age. Public polls show Democrats' troubles in the state stem from independent voters, who are more likely to side with Republicans in their assessment of the president.\n\nThe closely watched Siena College poll in June found Biden with an 8-point advantage over Trump. The same poll found only 28 percent of voters not enrolled in a major party supported Biden's reelection, and 71 percent of them disapproved of the job Biden is doing.\n\nBiden's support has declined since the winter, when he led Trump by 12 points in a February survey, according to the poll.\n\nThe public survey has matched the polling of labor groups, according to an official with one union who was granted anonymity to discuss the closely held data. The poll by the union in June found a nearly identical result for Biden.\n\n\"We were definitely alarmed at how bad he's doing statewide,\" the person said.\n\nMany of the troubles facing Biden in New York stem from a broader problem Democrats have in the state on issues GOP candidates have successfully seized in the last several years.\n\nDriven by the flood of migrants into New York City, high taxes and lingering perceptions of a crime wave, Republicans feel emboldened and believe they will be able to keep all five House seats they are contesting this year -- and come within striking distance of Trump winning the state's 28 electoral votes.\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to comment on the concerns from Democrats in New York, referring POLITICO to the state Democratic Party. Spokesperson Jen Goodman said Biden would win because voters in the state don't want Trump in the White House again.\n\n\"Time and again New Yorkers have rejected Donald Trump,\" Goodman said. \"He's the most unpopular person in New York politics, and there is no doubt that voters will once again turn out for President Biden in November.\"\n\nTrump, 78, has his own liabilities, especially with suburban voters and women. Democrats expect to run an aggressive campaign this fall that revolves around the threat Trump poses to reproductive rights -- even in a state with some of the strongest abortion laws on the books. His favorability among New Yorkers stands at a paltry 37 percent, the Siena survey in June found (Biden is at 42 percent favorable).\n\nThere is also the personal baggage Trump brings to the race, including 34 felony convictions in a case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg that stemmed from paying hush money to a porn star. A New York jury last year separately found Trump liable for sexual abuse and forced him to pay his accuser E. Jean Carroll $5 million.\n\nBut Democrats do not believe Trump's problems alone will make New York a shoo-in for Biden. The president needs to start drawing a contrast with Trump on the principles of democracy, Basil Smikle, a former executive director for the New York Democratic Party, said.\n\n\"The [Biden] campaign needs to do a better job of framing the argument that the choice is between a convicted felon and a president who has done a good job,\" Smikle said. \"It's alarming they have to do this in New York, a progressive state with a progressive history.\"\n\nDespite the stakes, elected officials and political leaders worry Democrats are sleepwalking in New York. And Biden, they argue, has to step in.\n\n\"He needs to remind New Yorkers why they should be voting for him,\" said Jasmine Gripper, the co-director of the left-leaning Working Families Party. \"We're dealing with voters who are feeling frustrated with both parties, and we just know that leads to low turnout.\"\n\nBut there is also a split screen effect among Democrats over the trouble Biden faces. The president's most ardent supporters, his pledged convention delegates from New York, expect to support his re-nomination when the party convenes in Chicago.\n\n\"Democrats will come home, and it will be an absolute landslide,\" Manhattan Democratic Chair Keith Wright said. \"Trump is not in play here.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pat Ryan, a freshman lawmaker whose seat is being targeted by Republicans this November, is confident Biden will remain a strong top of the ticket.\n\n\"I think the contrast is so clear and stark,\" Ryan said. \"You literally have a traitorous convicted felon versus a president who's really delivered in my district.\"\n\nRepublicans concede that Trump, a native New Yorker who built a business empire in the state and was a mainstay in the city's tabloids long before becoming a national figure, faces a steep uphill climb to win the state. But just a close race in New York is an indication of how successful Trump's campaign could be nationally with an otherwise deeply polarized electorate.\n\n\"Even if he doesn't win New York and New Jersey,\" Staten Island Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said, \"if he comes close, what does that tell you about the rest of the country?\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Levine_(New_York_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Levine (New York politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borough president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Hochul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Hochul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Paterson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Paterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_Inn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stonewall Inn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_LaBarbera", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary LaBarbera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

Capitol Hill will be the focus of attention this week, as Democratic lawmakers face competing arguments about whether Mr. Biden should be the party's nominee.\n\nSo far, eight House Democrats have directly called on the president to exit the race:\n\nStill, more congressional Democrats have publicly expressed support for Mr. Biden since the debate. And in recent days, some lawmakers have called for the party to unequivocally back the president, including prominent members of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nMeanwhile, as lawmakers prepared to return to Washington after last week's recess, a group of senior House Democrats met with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries over Zoom Sunday night, where a person on the call and three people familiar with the meeting told CBS News that three more lawmakers said Mr. Biden should leave the race:\n\nBut by Tuesday, Nadler said that he's \"fully supportive\" of Mr. Biden, and added that he was not going to \"comment on what I said in a private meeting.\"\n\n\"All I'll say is the president made very clear yesterday that he's running,\" Nadler said. \"And to me that's dispositive, we have to support him.\"\n\nMr. Biden has been working to address concerns about his ability to serve another term with a number of appearances in recent days, making clear his intention to stay in the race at every turn -- from a highly anticipated interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on Friday to rallies in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania over the holiday weekend.\n\nOn Monday, the president sent a letter to Democrats in Congress saying he is \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race and making clear that \"I wouldn't be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.\"\n\nThe president aimed to shut down discussions about replacing him, arguing that \"the voters of the Democratic Party have voted,\" and had selected him as their presumptive nominee. In March, he surpassed the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic Party's nomination, and now has secured 3,896 delegates. There are 1,976 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination at the convention in August. Mr. Biden warned that forcing him off the ticket would subvert the will of the voters: \"How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party?\"\n\nMr. Biden also called into \"Morning Joe\" on Monday, saying \"I'm more than presumptive, I'm gonna be the Democratic nominee.\" He expressed frustration with \"the elites\" doubting his fitness for another term, saying \"any of these guys that don't think I should run -- run against me. Go ahead, announce for President. Challenge me at the convention.\"\n\nThe president has also made outreach efforts in recent days, with a campaign official saying he personally made 20 calls to congressional members since the debate.\n\nMr. Biden, who represented Delaware in the Senate for over 30 years, will certainly be watching for signs of wavering support in the upper chamber. No Senate Democrats have publicly called for the president to step aside. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado on Tuesday night expressed doubt that the president will be able to beat former President Donald Trump in November, in the most critical comments made publicly by a Senate Democrat so far in the aftermath of the debate.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/08/27045e6c-483f-4674-8268-ebd32422bea0/thumbnail/1200x630g8/4dd0a52a858ebee4adab796e3aea1c4d/gettyimages-2159969247.jpg?v=2287029998c5246c93d6dd038eb30603", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713630", "eventUri": "eng-9713630", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

He goaded dissenting Democrats to run against him and \"challenge me at the convention\", in August.\n\nIt comes after five House Democrats have publicly called for Biden to step down for his re-election bid including Texas' Lloyd Doggett, Arizona's Raul Grijalva, Massachusetts' Seth Moulton, Illinois' Mike Quigley and Minnesota's Angie Craig.\n\nBiden continues to fight for his political survival as he maintains that he will both run against - and beat - Trump when the electorate hits the polls in November.\n\nCongressional Democrats received a two-page letter from the president on Monday as he tried to quell the uprising among senior party members.\n\nSharing on his Twitter/X account, Biden declared that he is \"firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump\".\n\nThe president will hope that this week's Nato summit will offer a reprieve and allow him to move forward with his campaign.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith_(Washington_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Smith (Washington politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Wild", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Wild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the committee on House Administration,\" reports The New York Times. The mere fact that Jeffries convened this meeting is of great significance: It's an acknowledgment from the top that this ticket isn't going to work, and that Democrats have a serious problem that lawmakers do not trust party operatives, campaign staffers, or Biden advisers to solve.\n\nBiden, in media appearances this weekend aimed at calming people's nerves about his age, said that only the \"Lord Almighty\" could convince him to step aside and allow another member of his party to run for president against Trump.\n\nDivine intervention needed: \"If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race,\" he told ABC. He added that the \"Lord Almighty's not coming down.\"\n\nWhen asked how he would feel if he lost to Trump, he responded: \"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\" (Interestingly, ABC and the White House initially disagreed on whether Biden had used the word goodest. More here.)\n\n\"All the pollsters I talk to say it's a tossup -- it's a tossup,\" Biden claimed. FiveThirtyEight, which maintains an \"updating average for each candidate in 2024 presidential polls, accounting for each poll's recency, sample size, methodology and house effects,\" does not support this assessment, saying Trump is polling ahead by 2.3 points. Two recent Ipsos/Reuters polls assessed Biden vs. Trump as well as a Kamala Harris vs. Trump ticket; Harris performed better than Biden in these matchups. Recent Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls in swing states have Biden performing better than he has been -- a recent uptick -- but only in Wisconsin and Michigan, which simply isn't enough.\n\n\"Like a lot of people, I was pretty horrified,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told WPRI, referring to Biden's debate performance. It seems as though all people of sound cognitive state agree: Biden cannot be kept on the ticket. It's Biden who refuses, along with several of the sycophants with whom he's surrounded himself.\n\nFrench chaos: Marine Le Pen's far-right party, National Rally, didn't do as well as predicted in legislative elections yesterday. A left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, won 178 seats, while President Emmanuel Macron's centrist party took 150; National Rally took 142.\n\nNo party will win a majority. It's gridlock time: As The New York Times describes it, the \"lower house of Parliament, where most legislative power resides, [has] no governing coalition appeared immediately conceivable,\" meaning Macron's \"centrists [are] squeezed between far-right and far-left groups that detest each other and him.\"\n\nIt's clear that Macron's gamble, to hold a snap election early versus later in the fall, did not pay off. Radicals on both left and right have more power and presence than before, while Macron -- who was already stunningly unpopular -- will be caught between the two.\n\n\"Finding a compromise candidate who could lead the next administration won't be easy,\" reports Bloomberg. \"Some early contenders include Marine Tondelier of the Green party and Raphael Glucksmann of the center-left Place Publique; current prime minister Gabriel Attal might also end up staying on.\" Macron must step down, ending his second term, in 2027, and current Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has, of this morning, tendered his resignation (as is customary in French politics), which Macron rejected, meaning Attal may stay on.\n\nScenes from New York: Oysters keep dying instead of reproducing, creating a huge problem for the scientists working to restore the bivalve population in New York's waters.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_wolfe@reason.com", "name": "Liz Wolfe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Adam Smith (D-Wash.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), according to two people familiar with the private session.\n\nOther members on the call voiced concerns about Biden's path to November, including Reps. Jim Himes (Conn.), Zoe Lofgren (Calif.), Don Beyer (Va.) and Rick Larsen (Wash.). It's a poor omen for the Biden campaign as the entire Democratic elected apparatus prepares to return to Washington on Monday evening where lawmakers will face tough questioning about their party's standard-bearer.\n\nAaron Fritschner, Beyer's spokesperson, posted on X to push back on reports that Beyer called for a new nominee: \"To be clear [Beyer] supports President Biden and said so on this call and any reporting to the contrary is a misunderstanding of what he said and what he believes.\"\n\nThe additional calls for Biden to stand aside from senior Democrats come after the president's interview last week with ABC News did nothing to assuage concerns among rank-and-file lawmakers about his continued viability in the race. Members have repeatedly urged the president to quickly schedule more unscripted events and town halls to continually demonstrate his vitality and energy.\n\nIt's not just the House either. A group of Senate Democrats are reportedly planning a discussion of Biden's path forward, led by Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), once that chamber returns to Washington on Monday. Five House Democrats have publicly urged Biden to stand down, while numerous others have expressed concerns about his viability in private.\n\nAnd if you think I'm only covering this to give myself an excuse to revisit Jerry Nadler crapping his pants live on stage and being seemingly incapable of wearing pants correctly.....you'd be 100% correct.\n\nIt's Friday afternoon so we're having a little fun around here....\n\nDoes anyone else remember the time Jerry Nadler crapped his pants live on stage and then had to awkwardly waddle off?

Steve Cohen off Tennessee told reporters that not only are Democrats not on the same page, \"we're not even in the same book\" while leaving a meeting of House Democrats at Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee headquarters.\n\nThat meeting was the first in a series of such get-togethers by Democrats on Tuesday in what is being described as a make-or-break day for Biden's political future, according to numerous Democrats, who told CNN that the decisions made in the separate meetings of Senate and House Democrats will likely seal his fate one way or another.\n\nCNN reported that party members described the meeting of the House Democrats as filled with \"sadness.\"\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks of New York called the meeting a \"listening session.\" Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland told CNN that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was \"listening,\" adding, \"It was organized as a listening opportunity.\"\n\nTop Biden ally Rep. Jim Clyburn said that the atmosphere in the meeting was \"very positive,\" although he did not go into further detail.\n\nThe South Carolina congressman repeatedly insisted that \"I'm ridin' with Biden.\"\n\nThere was some additional positive news for Biden on Tuesday, as a top House Democrat, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, said Democrats \"have to support\" the president, walking back calls he reportedly made in private for Biden to step down in the race, according to Forbes.\n\nThis many be an indication that Democrats are coming to terms with Biden's refusal to step down. Nadler's reversal represents a broader shift in Biden's favor as the president has firmly dismissed any calls for him to quit the race.\n\nAfter returning to Washington Monday from a holiday recess, no new congressional Democrats called on Biden to step down, but multiple lawmakers voiced their support for the president, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steve Horsford of Nevada, Forbes reported.\n\nBrian Freeman \u2709\n\nBrian Freeman, a Newsmax writer based in Israel, has more than three decades writing and editing about culture and politics for newspapers, online and television.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_freeman@newsmax.com", "name": "Brian Freeman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cohen (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Ivey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Ivey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Meeks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gregory Meeks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=79e9e571-25c8-40f5-bbf3-8adc7076ad26&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713630", "eventUri": "eng-9713630", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Jim Himes is getting texts and emails constantly about Biden's capabilities from his constituency, and none of them are kind about it. So much so that Biden has become a threat:\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-Conn), top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said he had gotten several hundred texts and emails about Biden's age -- and not a single one of them wanted him to remain. He also argued, we're told, that both chambers of Congress would be lost with Biden in the race, a sentiment we've heard from most Democrats we've spoken to in the past week.\n\nHimes isn't the only one hearing this rumbling. According to the Washington Examiner, other Democrats are sounding the alarm:\n\nSome Democrats have had to carefully watch their words concerning the president given his recent unpopularity among voters, indicated by polls that have former President Donald Trump ahead in multiple swing states, in likely fear that staunchly supporting him now may alienate some voters.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) mentioned that \"the top of the ticket is very important for down-ballot races, especially in swing districts,\" though reiterated his support for Biden in late June.\n\nBiden is posing a clear threat to the Democrat Party with his mere presence. Despite attempts to make it seem like he's both determined and capable, it's pretty clear that all the media's horses and all the media's men can't put Biden's campaign back together again. Despite the fact that it's a dead campaign walking, Biden has stated he's not moving from his position.\n\nAs RedState reported, Colorado Democrat Senator Michael Bennet foresees a \"landslide win\" for Donald Trump against Biden, and he's likely correct. I'm not entirely sure how the Democrats pull a victory out of thin air at this point. Even if they do swap Biden out with someone, none of the Democrats that could fit the bill would be able to overcome the momentum Trump has.\n\n(READ: Democrat Senator Predicts Trump Landslide Win in November)\n\nIf things are that bad for Biden, any attachment to him could be seen by voters as being complicit in, not just the downfall of the Democrat Party in the 2024 election, but also being part in allowing the man the Democrats told everyone was the most dangerous person in America back into the White House. In a way, the Democrat's own faux panic about Trump is now backfiring on them, which is par for the course for Democrats as of late.\n\nThe best laid plans of mice and men...\n\nAccording to many polls, Democrats are still projected to control the House after November, but Biden could ruin that. Even if Democrats flat-out reject Biden in public, they could still be blanket-blamed for inviting this disaster for not working hard enough as a party to get him out. Indeed, the current turmoil happening within the party isn't a good look, and if the party can't get it together as a unit then that can't help give people faith in it going forward.

One is that although most party faithful are falling into line after two weeks of rebellion, almost none of them really believes Biden is up to the job.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), for example, was one of four congressional Democrats among an advance guard saying last weekend that Biden must step down, yet now, with a tone of resignation, he concedes, \"He's going to be our nominee, and we all have to support him.\"\n\n\"Have to support him\" is not a ringing endorsement. It's no more than a shamefaced acceptance. Like everyone in his party, Nadler knows he's backing a man manifestly incompetent for the high office he holds, who cannot revive because his mental meltdown in the debate wasn't due to a curable illness and who will inevitably get more feeble and less able to cope with the strains of leading at home and abroad. Biden is declining fast, and the slide is noticeable not just each year or each month, but almost each week and day.\n\nDemocrats \"have to support him\" because Biden secured 9 out of every 10 convention delegates in the primaries and cannot be dislodged involuntarily, and he has made it plain, as he said to ABC's George Stephanopoulos, that he'll keep running unless \"the Lord almighty [comes and says] 'Joe, get outta the race.'\"\n\nInvoking intervention by the almighty may be unwise given how close Biden is to that encounter in election circumstances or otherwise. But it shows he'll fight party pressure, or that Dr. Jill, Hunter, and the rest of his inner circle won't allow capitulation. They enjoy the perks of power, and who can blame them? Some of them, after all, have been selling it for millions of dollars over the years.\n\nBut even though Democrats are closing ranks, they are not slamming the door on an alternative nominee. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told MSNBC on Wednesday that Biden \"has to make that decision because time is running short.\" That's an odd formulation given that Biden has already made his decision and started this crucial week with an unequivocal and defiant letter to House Democrats refusing to stand aside.\n\nSo, Biden probably isn't going away, and yet everyone knows he cannot run the country for another four years. (He isn't really running it now but is, rather, tottering to the tune of family members, close officials, and party bigwigs who tell him what to do.)\n\nThere is an inescapable conclusion, and one must face it. The fact that Democrats know Biden cannot lead the nation but are nevertheless backing him means they are making mental arrangements for the inauguration of President Kamala Harris.\n\nIf Biden manages to beat former President Donald Trump and takes the oath of office but dies in office or sinks into total dotage before 2028, Harris would step into the Oval Office automatically. Her favorable-vs.-unfavorable numbers are nearly as deeply underwater as Biden's, and she has shown herself an even less capable election campaigner. But she stands to inherit the presidency without ever having to win over voters to that appalling idea.\n\nThat may be the Democrats' ultimate calculation. If they can't ditch Biden, they might be able to shove him over the election finish line and have him vacate the Oval Office early in his second term, giving Harris two or three years of incumbency -- perhaps even more, as was the case for Harry Truman in 1945.\n\nIt is a breathtakingly antidemocratic calculation but wholly in line with the Left's and the Democrats' now-habitual preference for governing without input from the public. They are already talking about the election being less about Biden than about choosing a team. The Biden presidency, like the Obama presidency, has seen a massive shift in the party toward treating America's citizens as deplorable plebs who cannot be trusted with the task of self-government, which is essential to a democratic republic.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nMore and more decisions that Americans are supposed to make, which are necessary for sovereign control, are being pried from their grasp and given to an unelected oligarchy in Washington, the permanent civil service, the deep state -- whatever you wish to call it.\n\nIt would be completely on brand for these people, contemptuous of the public for whom they supposedly work, to try to install a fading figurehead in the White House at the start of a second term knowing he'd soon give them an opportunity to anoint the first woman president.

Biden has defiantly insisted he is staying the course, telling lawmakers this week he is not going anywhere.\n\nTrump, who has kept a relatively low-profile as anxious Democrats publicly and privately air concerns, returned to the campaign trail on Tuesday with a rally in Florida.\n\nU.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., became the ninth Democrat to call on Biden to end his reelection bid.\n\nBlumenauer, a senior member of the House Ways and Means and Budget committees, commended the president for his accomplishments, claiming in a statement released Wednesday that Biden \"will be recorded in history as the most successful president in the last 50 years.\"\n\nHowever, the congressmen added that, in his mind, \"We will all be better served if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee and manages a transition under his terms.\"\n\n\"The next six months will be critical in the implementation of President Biden's landmark accomplishments that will define his legacy for generations to come. He should devote his energy and undivided attention to issues of war and peace, the climate crisis, and rebuilding and renewing America,\" Blumenauer said, in part.\n\n-ABC News' Ben Siegel\n\nThe AFL-CIO for the second time in a week put out a statement in support of President Joe Biden after unanimously voting to reaffirm their support for the Biden-Harris ticket, saying that they are the \"most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nThe union, which endorsed the Biden-Harris campaign in June 2023, urged Democrats to support Biden saying, \"The labor movement is united behind President Biden and Vice President Harris. We urge his party and the American people to join us.\"\n\n\"The message from today's meeting couldn't have been clearer: Right now, it's time to come together around a vision of a country where everyone has a fair shot with a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time to do the things we love like spending time with family and friends and pursuing our interests and passions. These are fundamental to, as the president reiterated to our meeting, building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down,\" the AFL-CIO Executive Council said in a statement..\n\n-ABC News' Beatrice Peterson\n\nCalifornia Gov.

That group of donors, which gives anywhere from five to eight figures, are on pause, which is very damaging since they're a major part of the donor ecosystem, the adviser said.\n\nThis adviser adds that the hand-wringing in the meantime has been very harmful to the campaign.\n\nAnother Democratic fundraiser says while a strong performance at the solo press conference Thursday could help the situation, many donors believe the crisis around Biden just won't go away.\n\nThe doubts raised by members of Congress, the comments from Nancy Pelosi, and the op-ed from George Clooney are all fueling a flurry of discussions among donors about what to do if Biden drops out.\n\n-ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Selina Wang\n\nSeveral Congressional Black Caucus members expressed their support for the president as the Democratic nominee following their weekly meeting Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm going to work very hard for him,\" Rep. Maxine Waters. a California Democrat, told ABC News. \"I think he's kept all his promises and I am very very supportive.\"\n\nWaters and Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, emphasized their prior endorsements of the president's reelection bid and support Biden's decision to stay in the race.\n\n\"I do not think he should step aside,\" Green said. \"And I think the president has said he is not stepping aside, so I think that counts too doesn't it.\"\n\nRep. Cori Bush D-Miss., however, did not give a full-throated endorsement but emphasized she wants to beat Trump in November.\n\nWhen ask if Biden can defeat the former president, Bush told ABC News, \"that is a question for Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"I can't speak to that. It's up to the president,\" she added.\n\n-ABC News' Arthur Jones II and Rachel Scott\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has told colleagues in private meetings that he plans to relay concerns about President Biden's campaign -- voiced by House Democrats -- personally to the president, multiple people familiar with his comments told. ABC News.\n\nJeffries has been huddling with Democrats from across the ideological spectrum this week to hear their worries about the presidential election and their own down-ballot races following Biden's poor debate performance and his interview with ABC News.\n\n-ABC News' Ben Siegel\n\nPresident Joe Biden will hold a one-on-one interview with NBC News' Lester Holt Monday, the network announced.\n\nThis will mark the second TV interview Biden has held since last month's presidential debate.\n\nHolt will interview Biden earlier in the day while he's in Austin, Texas, and the full interview will air at 9 p.m. ET, the network announced.\n\nIn back-to-back House Financial Services Committee hearings with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, both regular, annual hearings on their agency's policies, Republican Mike Lawler of New York redirected from questions about inflation and tariffs on Russia to ask each official about their personal interactions with the president.\n\nYellen said she wouldn't describe the content of her meetings with the president or say when she last met with him because it was \"private,\" but she called Biden \"extremely effective.\"\n\n\"The president is extremely effective in the meetings that I've been in with him, that includes many international meetings that are multi hour, like his meetings with President Xi [Jinping of China],\" she said.\n\n\"Madam secretary, have there been any discussions among Cabinet secretaries about invoking the 25th Amendment?\" Lawler asked.\n\n\"No,\" Yellen said resolutely. The 25th Amendment states that the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet can together remove power from the president if he or she is incapacitated.\n\nPowell, asked by Lawler if he's \"noticed any mental or cognitive decline\" in meetings with the president, said \"no.\"\n\nBut Powell noted that he'd only interacted with the president twice in the last two years -- once for a meeting and once to shake his hand at a state dinner, which Powell said was normal for presidents and Federal Reserve chairs, given the independence of the agency.\n\n-ABC News' Cheyenne Haslett\n\nMultiple Senate Democrats spoke candidly with ABC News about concerns they have about Biden's viability and said they want to continue discussions about the best path forward.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he is worried about \"an existential threat to the country if Donald Trump wins,\" and added \"every day is critical\" as Biden weighs his path forward.\n\n\"I have confidence in Joe Biden doing what's right for America. What he believes is right for America is to defeat Donald Trump and he'll be a pretty good judge of whether that will be possible,\" Blumenthal said. \"We can all advise him we can raise concerns ultimately the decision is his and I am going to continue to raise concerns but I do think we need to ultimately unify because the existential threat here is Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, associated himself with the comments of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi made on MSNBC Wednesday, in which she appeared to leave the door open for the president to step aside.\n\n\"I thought Speaker Pelosi nailed it pretty well this morning,\" Whitehouse told ABC News. He repeatedly avoided answering additional questions about whether Biden should resign before reiterating his support for Pelosi's comments.\n\nAlthough Sen. Dick Durbin told ABC News Durbin he was \"very concerned\" about Biden's chances, he added that he's always known the race would be close.\n\n\"I believe we wage the right campaign and make a point of what we've achieved under this president we will see him reelected,\" Durbin said.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who expressed worries about Biden's future during a closed-door meeting among Senate Democrats Tuesday, told ABC News he was hearing legitimate concerns from voters.\n\n\"My job is to listen to them my job is to go to hearings like this to fight for lower drug prices to fight for Ohio workers,\" Brown said.\n\n-ABC News' Allison Pecorin and Rachel Scott\n\nNew York Rep. Pat Ryan, a moderate Democrat, is now calling on Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Trump is an existential threat to American democracy; it is our duty to put forward the strongest candidate against him,\" Ryan wrote on X. \"Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump. For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside -- to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.\"\n\nRyan is the eighth House Democrat to publicly call on

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also been fielding messages from colleagues, according to people familiar with the conversations, and in a Wednesday television interview she declined to express affirmative support for Biden's campaign.\n\n\"I understand Democratic leaders feel they have to be with him,\" said Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), who is among roughly a dozen Democrats who've come out against Biden on the ticket. \"But I also know that he's conveying the wide range of concerns from the broad, diverse members of the caucus to the White House.\"\n\nIt is not clear when either Jeffries or Pelosi might speak with Biden directly. In an ABC News interview last week, Biden declined to say what he would do if congressional leaders approached him with a message that his persistence in the race would cost them control of the House and Senate.\n\nMorale among congressional Democrats is miserably low, and there is a mood of profound pessimism about Biden's ability to carry Democrats to victory in November. Several up-and-coming Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to drop his campaign this week, including Reps. Pat Ryan of New York and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey.\n\nBut the president has influential allies in the House, including respected leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus who have warned the party against making an abrupt move against a president who garnered overwhelming support from Black voters in his previous campaign. Those Black Caucus leaders are also some of Jeffries' biggest supporters.\n\nLawmakers looking for guidance from Jeffries on how to proceed have not received much of it. The leader's allies say it's in his nature to meticulously survey the caucus before attempting to set a specific direction. But they also acknowledge there's no easy way for him to resolve the divisions in the party.\n\n\"Either way he loses,\" said one Democratic lawmaker close to Jeffries, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nA spokesperson for Jeffries declined to comment for this story, citing the private discussions.\n\nThe pressure on Jeffries to address those rifts has grown by the day, as new signs of frustration, backbiting and panic have continued to emerge. Closed-door and public critiques of Biden's future have infuriated Biden's supporters in the Capitol.\n\n\"I just wish they wouldn't beat up on [him],\" said Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.). \"You don't tackle your own quarterback, ... it's really stupid.\"\n\nFrustrations have been running particularly high as Democrats feel that their remarks from private meetings and phone calls over the last two weeks have been made public. And in a move that surprised many Democrats, Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) admitted -- and apologized -- to fellow senior Democrats that his office played a role in leaking part of what was said on a weekend phone call about Biden's future on the ticket.\n\nTakano, who is the top Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs panel, said in a message to a group of senior members, obtained by POLITICO, that one of his staff members shared a screenshot about Wild's remarks with a reporter, who then used the information without permission. He apologized in person to Democrats at Wednesday's whip meeting, as well.\n\nTakano himself is one of roughly a dozen Democrats who have said Biden should drop out of the race -- including eight publicly. Among those who want Biden out, there's no organized effort behind their push, according to two people familiar with the situation.\n\nThe list of boot-Biden Democrats transcends both ideology and generations. Some members of the \"Squad,\" such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have vocally stuck behind Biden, while more senior members like Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who is on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus, have taken the opposite approach.\n\nA handful of lawmakers in the centrist New Democratic Coalition also met with Jeffries Wednesday to discuss how having Biden at the top of the ticket could impact incumbents in battleground districts.\n\nMany in the party say they are waiting on Jeffries to give firmer direction on the way forward -- either steering the caucus to come together or taking a forceful step himself to boot Biden and save the House.\n\nJeffries and House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) have repeatedly said they support Biden. But other party leaders have raised eyebrows in recent days with less-than-full-throated endorsements of Biden. Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), the No. 3 Democrat, left some ambiguity when asked about the president -- voicing his support but also indicating he wanted to see more from him.\n\n\"Let's see the press conference,\" Aguilar said, referring to Biden's NATO press conference on Thursday. \"Let's see the campaign stops and see all of this because all of it is going to be necessary.\"\n\nAnother key group has been Jeffries' closest allies, the Black Caucus, which has come out strong for Biden after his debate performance and bought the president some breathing room in the party.\n\nBiden privately huddled with the Black Caucus last Friday as he started to hear out Democratic lawmakers' concerns, and the group has ramped up its own internal discussions on a path forward. The influential bloc met privately with Biden on Monday night and held a separate political meeting on Tuesday night. They've also been a key source of support for Jeffries as some of his earliest boosters and closest advisers in the House.\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), a former chair of the bloc, said at their meeting Tuesday night that their current Chair Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) \"did a great job of laying out\" to the caucus why it would be difficult to change presidential nominees.\n\nAsked why the Black Caucus was playing the role of vocal Biden defenders during the party crisis, Horsford, who represents a purple district, replied: \"We're the conscience of the Congress.\"\n\n\"The CBC has looked at President Biden's record, we looked at the Biden-Harris administration record, because I remind folks, it's not one person, it's an entire team, and they have delivered to the Black community,\" said Rep. Marilyn Strickland (D-Wash.), the whip of the Black Caucus.\n\nBut another minority group, the Asian Pacific American Caucus, feels left out of the conversation.\n\n\"We are concerned that he is not taking our views into account and we wonder what's going on with this lack of response,\" said Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), the chair of that bloc who has voiced concerns about Biden's candidacy. \"That is part of this process of making a decision for us.\"\n\nDemocrats can agree on one thing: They need a clear solution well before the Democratic convention in a month.\n\n\"I think we've got to do something fast, whether ... he decides to run or not. I think tomorrow's press conference -- a lot of people are watching that to see how that turns out,\" said Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.).", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person",

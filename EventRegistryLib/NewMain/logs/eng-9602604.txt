The Butterfly Forest features plant species endemic to the region, as well as birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates from different parts of the world, all inside about 6,400 square feet of forest with cliffs, inclinations and a waterfall.\n\nThe Butterfly Forest was created this spring to create public awareness on some of the research MUSE is doing in Udzungwa Mountains to study and protect the world's biodiversity against threats such as deforestation and climate change.\n\nDeforestation leads to habitat loss, which causes declines in nectar sources for butterflies, changing the functioning of the ecosystem.\n\nIt can also limit the movements of the insects, causing a decline in biodiversity and potential extinction of vulnerable butterfly species.\n\nChanges to soil and air temperatures are altering the life cycles of the insects, impacting their development rates, mating behaviors and migration patterns. Butterfly populations are declining in many areas, especially in places under intensive land use.\n\n\"Our aim is that of being able to study better, to understand better what is happening,\" said Lisa Angelini, a botanist and director of the MUSE greenhouse. \"Our work consists of monitoring and trying to develop projects in order to bring attention to biodiversity-related issues.\"\n\nButterflies are pollinators that enable plants to reproduce and therefore facilitate food production and supply. They are also food for birds and other animals.\n\nBecause of the multiple roles of butterflies in the ecosystem and their high sensitivity to environmental changes, scientists use them as indicators of biodiversity and a way to study the impact of habitat loss and other threats.\n\n\"Insects in general play a fundamental role in the proper functioning of ecosystems,\" said Mauro Gobbi, an entomologist and researcher at MUSE.\n\nThrough a partnership with the Tanzania National Parks Authority, MUSE established the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Center in 2006 to support research as well as in development of environmental education programs for schools.\n\n\"Research on butterflies is essential for informing conservation efforts and ensuring the long-term survival of the insects,\" said Arafat Mtui, research coordinator at Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre.\n\nConservation efforts such as habitat restoration and good land management practices, which address climate change impacts, are essential for protecting butterfly populations, he added.\n\nWith at least 2,500 plant species, more than 120 mammals and thousands of invertebrate species, Udzungwa Mountains is rich in biological diversity. It's part of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Kenya and Tanzania that are a proposed UNESCO Heritage site.\n\nIt has more than 40 endemic species of butterflies.\n\nMUSE's work here is vital because of this variety, said Sevgan Subramanian, principal scientist and head of environmental health at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi.\n\n\"If you want to have a monitoring of the health of the ecosystem, monitoring such indigenous or endemic insect population diversity is very critical, so that we have an idea whether the ecosystem is still healthy or not,\" he said.\n\nGobbi, the entomologist, said high-altitude environments like Udzungwa Mountains National Park are suitable for studying the effects of climate change because they usually have no direct human impact.\n\nHe and other scientists warned that failure to protect insects from climate change effects will drastically reduce the planet's ability to build a sustainable future.\n\nScientists at MUSE said the main challenge in butterfly conservation is changing the current farming policies to increase the amount of low-intensity farmland, and promote diverse landscapes preserving the remaining patches of natural habitats.\n\n\"Often our grandparents used to say 'there are no longer as many butterflies as there used to be,'\" he said.

Butterfly populations are declining in many areas, especially in places under intensive land use.\n\n\"Our aim is that of being able to study better, to understand better what is happening,\" said Lisa Angelini, a botanist and director of the MUSE greenhouse. \"Our work consists of monitoring and trying to develop projects in order to bring attention to biodiversity-related issues.\"\n\nButterflies are pollinators that enable plants to reproduce and therefore facilitate food production and supply.

The Butterfly Forest features plant species endemic to the region, as well as birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates from different parts of the world, all inside about 6,400 square feet of forest with cliffs, inclinations and a waterfall.\n\nThe Butterfly Forest was created this spring to create public awareness on some of the research MUSE is doing in Udzungwa Mountains to study and protect the world's biodiversity against threats such as deforestation and climate change.\n\nSt. Louis alt-weekly Riverfront Times sold, lays off all staff Sisters, 8 and 10, who died in wreck on I-270 were best friends, family says Neman: The legend of the Des Peres pickle jar continues to fascinate and delight The end of Riverfront Times brings shock, sense of loss.

Butterfly populations are declining in many areas, especially in places under intensive land use.\n\n\"Our aim is that of being able to study better, to understand better what is happening,\" said Lisa Angelini, a botanist and director of the MUSE greenhouse. \"Our work consists of monitoring and trying to develop projects in order to bring attention to biodiversity-related issues.\"\n\nButterflies are pollinators that enable plants to reproduce and therefore facilitate food production and supply. They are also food for birds and other animals.\n\nBecause of the multiple roles of butterflies in the ecosystem and their high sensitivity to environmental changes, scientists use them as indicators of biodiversity and a way to study the impact of habitat loss and other threats.\n\n\"Insects in general play a fundamental role in the proper functioning of ecosystems,\" said Mauro Gobbi, an entomologist and researcher at MUSE.\n\nThrough a partnership with the Tanzania National Parks Authority, MUSE established the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Center in 2006 to support research as well as in development of environmental education programs for schools.\n\n\"Research on butterflies is essential for informing conservation efforts and ensuring the long-term survival of the insects,\" said Arafat Mtui, research coordinator at Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre.\n\nTravel Botanists are scouring the US-Mexico border to document a forgotten ecosystem split by a giant wall By JULIE WATSON - Associated Press\n\nConservation efforts such as habitat restoration and good land management practices, which address climate change impacts, are essential for protecting butterfly populations, he added.\n\nWith at least 2,500 plant species, more than 120 mammals and thousands of invertebrate species, Udzungwa Mountains is rich in biological diversity. It's part of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Kenya and Tanzania that are a proposed UNESCO Heritage site.\n\nIt has more than 40 endemic species of butterflies.\n\nMUSE's work here is vital because of this variety, said Sevgan Subramanian, principal scientist and head of environmental health at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi.\n\n\"If you want to have a monitoring of the health of the ecosystem, monitoring such indigenous or endemic insect population diversity is very critical, so that we have an idea whether the ecosystem is still healthy or not,\" he said.\n\nTravel How cockroaches spread around the globe to become the pest we know today By ADITHI RAMAKRISHNAN - AP Science Writer\n\nGobbi, the entomologist, said high-altitude environments like Udzungwa Mountains National Park are suitable for studying the effects of climate change because they usually have no direct human impact.\n\nHe and other scientists warned that failure to protect insects from climate change effects will drastically reduce the planet's ability to build a sustainable future.\n\nScientists at MUSE said the main challenge in butterfly conservation is changing the current farming policies to increase the amount of low-intensity farmland, and promote diverse landscapes preserving the remaining patches of natural habitats.\n\n\"Often our grandparents used to say 'there are no longer as many butterflies as there used to be,'\" he said. This is \"absolutely supported by scientific research, which confirms that butterflies, like other insects, are in crisis.

The Butterfly Forest features plant species endemic to the region, as well as birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates from different parts of the world, all inside about 6,400 square feet of forest with cliffs, inclinations and a waterfall.\n\nThe Butterfly Forest was created this spring to create public awareness on some of the research MUSE is doing in Udzungwa Mountains to study and protect the world's biodiversity against threats such as deforestation and climate change.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Butterfly populations are declining in many areas, especially in places under intensive land use.\n\n\"Our aim is that of being able to study better, to understand better what is happening,\" said Lisa Angelini, a botanist and director of the MUSE greenhouse. \"Our work consists of monitoring and trying to develop projects in order to bring attention to biodiversity-related issues.\"\n\nButterflies are pollinators that enable plants to reproduce and therefore facilitate food production and supply. They are also food for birds and other animals.\n\nBecause of the multiple roles of butterflies in the ecosystem and their high sensitivity to environmental changes, scientists use them as indicators of biodiversity and a way to study the impact of habitat loss and other threats.\n\n\"Insects in general play a fundamental role in the proper functioning of ecosystems,\" said Mauro Gobbi, an entomologist and researcher at MUSE.\n\nThrough a partnership with the Tanzania National Parks Authority, MUSE established the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Center in 2006 to support research as well as in development of environmental education programs for schools.\n\n\"Research on butterflies is essential for informing conservation efforts and ensuring the long-term survival of the insects,\" said Arafat Mtui, research coordinator at Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre.\n\nTravel Botanists are scouring the US-Mexico border to document a forgotten ecosystem split by a giant wall By JULIE WATSON - Associated Press\n\nConservation efforts such as habitat restoration and good land management practices, which address climate change impacts, are essential for protecting butterfly populations, he added.\n\nWith at least 2,500 plant species, more than 120 mammals and thousands of invertebrate species, Udzungwa Mountains is rich in biological diversity. It's part of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Kenya and Tanzania that are a proposed UNESCO Heritage site.\n\nIt has more than 40 endemic species of butterflies.\n\nMUSE's work here is vital because of this variety, said Sevgan Subramanian, principal scientist and head of environmental health at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi.\n\n\"If you want to have a monitoring of the health of the ecosystem, monitoring such indigenous or endemic insect population diversity is very critical, so that we have an idea whether the ecosystem is still healthy or not,\" he said.\n\nTravel How cockroaches spread around the globe to become the pest we know today By ADITHI RAMAKRISHNAN - AP Science Writer\n\nGobbi, the entomologist, said high-altitude environments like Udzungwa Mountains National Park are suitable for studying the effects of climate change because they usually have no direct human impact.\n\nHe and other scientists warned that failure to protect insects from climate change effects will drastically reduce the planet's ability to build a sustainable future.\n\nScientists at MUSE said the main challenge in butterfly conservation is changing the current farming policies to increase the amount of low-intensity farmland, and promote diverse landscapes preserving the remaining patches of natural habitats.\n\n\"Often our grandparents used to say 'there are no longer as many butterflies as there used to be,'\" he said. This is \"absolutely supported by scientific research, which confirms that butterflies, like other insects, are in crisis. We are losing species, we're losing them forever, and this is going to break the balance of ecosystems.\"\n\nClose\n\nA Papilio Rumanzovia butterfly flies through flowers May 6 at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze, a science museum in Trento, Italy.\n\nLuca Bruno, Associated Press\n\nHeliconius Melpomene butterflies mate May 6 at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze in Trento, Italy.\n\nLuca Bruno\n\nA butterfly nursery with chrysalises of different species is displayed May 6 at the greenhouse of the Museo delle Scienze in Trento, Italy.

Italian Museum Recreates Tanzanian Forest", "body": "The Museo delle Scienze (MUSE) in Trento, Italy, has created the Butterfly Forest, a lush greenhouse modeled on Tanzania's Udzungwa Mountains, a biodiversity hotspot. The exhibit features plant species endemic to the area and animals from all over the world, including butterflies, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. This project aims to create awareness on MUSE's research on the world's biodiversity and how to protect against threats like deforestation and climate change. Research has found that the survival of butterflies, crucial pollinators and indicators of ecosystem health, is affected by environmental factors like deforestation and change in soil and air temperature. The inadequacy of these environmental factors will cause a declining butterfly population as well as habitat loss. MUSE collaborates with the Tanzania National Parks Authority to monitor and conserve butterfly species through habitat restoration and sustainable land management practices, among others.\n\nSOURCE: VOA NEWS", "source": {"uri": "iafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tanzania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tanzania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udzungwa_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Udzungwa Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_hotspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biodiversity hotspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trento"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trento"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amphibian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Endemism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deforestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reptile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biodiversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restoration ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_land_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable land management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Habitat destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National park"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Wildlife", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://iafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/9-19.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602604", "eventUri": "eng-9602604", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

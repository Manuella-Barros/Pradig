{"id": 232109676, "title": "Biden makes jab at Trump for skipping visit to WWI cemetery as he closes out trip to France", "text": "President Joe Biden called out presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump without naming him on Sunday. Biden, spending his last day in France to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, stopped at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery roughly 50 miles outside of Paris. The cemetery contains the graves of 2,289 American war dead, mostly from a significant World War I battle. But Biden also alluded to a 2018 trip Trump took to the area in which he neglected to visit the cemetery due to bad weather. \u201cMore Marines were lost here than in any battle until World War II,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd the idea that I\u2019d come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to pay tribute \u2026 think about it. America showed up.\u201d Trump was scheduled to visit the same cemetery in 2018, but the trip was canceled due to bad weather. Presidents often fly by helicopter for short trips but will go by motorcade, which is slower, in the event of heavy rain. Trump\u2019s team said the trip was canceled because the cemetery was too far to travel by motorcade in the allotted time frame. A report later emerged, citing anonymous sources, that Trump canceled the visit in part because he thoughts the Marines who died in the battle were \u201csuckers\u201d and the cemetery was \u201cfilled with losers.\u201d While Biden did not mention those words on Sunday, he has referenced them at other times. Trump and his allies have fiercely denied he ever said the comments, and the Republican National Committee sent out an email blast shortly after Biden\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t true in 2020 and it\u2019s still not true now \u2014 but no disgusting lies are beneath Biden,\u201d RNC spokesman Jake Schneider said. The blast cited a CBS report saying emails proved that a bad weather call led to the 2018 cancellation. The RNC also pointed to 15 current or former Trump associates who have denied the report. Biden also suggested that isolationism is not the right path forward for the United States, something he has said repeatedly that can be read as a rebuttal to Trump. \u201cAnd the idea that we were able to avoid being engaged in major battles in Europe \u2014 it\u2019s just not realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we continue to have the allies that we have, continue to beef up those alliances \u2026 continue to keep NATO strong. Continue to do what we\u2019ve been able to since the end of World War Two.\u201d", "summary": "President Joe Biden called out presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump without naming him on Sunday.

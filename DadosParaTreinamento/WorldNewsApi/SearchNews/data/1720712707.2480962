The \u201cOn the Floor\u201d songstress dined at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, Calif., with a friend on Saturday with the massive rock on her finger. Paparazzi caught a glimpse of the diamond sticking out of the hitmaker\u2019s creme long-sleeve knit dress as she put on her seat belt while leaving the restaurant. For the outing, Lopez, 54, wore her locks up in a low ponytail and sported hoop earrings. Affleck, 51, didn\u2019t appear to join her. The \u201cLet\u2019s Get Loud\u201d singer\u2019s sighting comes after TMZ reported she and the \u201cGone Girl\u201d star put their ritzy Beverly Hills, Calif., estate up for sale amid divorce rumors. Per the outlet, the duo enlisted The Agency\u2019s realtor Santiago Arana to help with the sale of the property that they purchased in May 2023. Potential buyers have reportedly been touring the home for the past two weeks, though it hasn\u2019t been snatched up yet. Lopez and Affleck are also asking \u201caround $65 million\u201d for their shared home after spending money on improving the estate, according to the outlet. However, they are prepared to lose \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d in the sale due to \u201ca new tax on super-expensive properties, along with significant money they plunked down in improvements.\u201d The \u201cGigli\u201d co-stars \u2014 who tied the knot in July 2022 \u2014 have been at the forefront of split rumors ever since it was revealed Affleck had moved out of their home and was living in a Brentwood, Calif., mansion. Affleck has also been photographed wearing his wedding ring on and off as he\u2019s been working on filming \u201cAccountant 2.\u201d Meanwhile, Lopez recently canceled her \u201cThis Is Me \u2026 Live\u201d tour to spend time with her family, sources told Page Six. Despite the rumors, the couple has continued to put on a united front as they attended Affleck\u2019s 12-year-old son Samuel\u2019s basketball game together alongside the actor\u2019s ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, last week. They also attended the \u201cArgo\u201d star\u2019s 18-year-old daughter Violet\u2019s high school graduation party.", "summary": "On Saturday, the singer was photographed wearing the massive rock during dinner with a friend as divorce rumors with the \"Air\" actor continue to loom.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/06/09/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-seen-wearing-wedding-ring-after-putting-60m-marital-home-with-ben-affleck-up-for-sale/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/83532997.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PLANMs2b-guILbWnz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:43:50", "author": "Vanessa Serna", "authors": ["Vanessa Serna"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.017}

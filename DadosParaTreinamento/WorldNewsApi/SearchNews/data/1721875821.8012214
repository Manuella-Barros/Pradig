{"id": 240266286, "title": "Israel bombs Gaza as fears grow of wider war", "text": "GAZA STRIP \u2014 Israel bombed the Gaza Strip where one hospital reported at least 30 dead on Friday and as exchanges of fire and threats over the Lebanon border raised fears of an even wider war. After further cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hizbollah movement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the clashes must not turn Lebanon into \"another Gaza\". Increased \u201cbellicose rhetoric\u201d from both sides risked triggering a catastrophe \u201cbeyond imagination\u201d, he said. In Gaza the director of Gaza City\u2019s Al Ahli hospital was quoted by the territory\u2019s health ministry as reporting 30 dead on Friday in intensified Israeli bombardment. \u201cIt has been a difficult and brutal day in Gaza City. So far, around 30 martyrs have arrived at the Al Ahli Arab hospital,\u201d Dr Fadel Naeem was quoted as saying. Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Basal said five municipal workers died when a garage in the city was bombed. Israel\u2019s military reported military operations on Friday \u201cnorth and south of the Central Gaza Strip Corridor\u201d. AFPTV captured an overnight strike on Khan Yunis city, showing a ball of fire and sparks erupting in a residential district. Just before midnight Thursday, Israel\u2019s army said it had \u201csuccessfully intercepted a suspicious aerial target that crossed from Lebanon\u201d. Early Friday, Lebanese official media reported new Israeli strikes in the south. They came after Hizbollah said it had fired dozens of rockets at a barracks in northern Israel on Thursday in retaliation for a deadly air strike in south Lebanon. Israel said a Hizbollah operative was killed in that strike. It said jets struck Hezbollah sites and used artillery \u201cto remove threats in multiple areas in southern Lebanon\u201d. Hizbollah claimed a number of attacks on Israeli troops and positions near the border on Friday, including two using drones. Experts are divided on the prospect of a wider war, almost nine months into Israel\u2019s campaign to eradicate Iran-backed Hizbollah\u2019s ally Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip. Exchanges between Hizbollah and Israel have escalated, and Israel\u2019s military said on Tuesday plans for an offensive in Lebanon \u201cwere approved and validated\u201d. Hizbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said \u201cno place\u201d in Israel would \u201cbe spared our rockets\u201d in a wider war, and also threatened nearby European Union member Cyprus. Israel\u2019s ally the United States has appealed for de-escalation. Two soldiers killed The violence on the Lebanon border began after the October 7 attack by Hamas militants from Gaza into southern Israel. That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead. Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,431 people, also mostly civilians, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry. Months of negotiations towards a truce and a hostage release have failed to make headway, but mediator Qatar insisted Friday it was still working to \u201cbridge the gap\u201d between Israel and Hamas. The war has destroyed much of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure and left residents short of food, fuel and other essentials. On June 16 the army said it would implement a daily \u201ctactical pause of military activity\u201d in a southern Gaza corridor to facilitate aid delivery. But on Friday Richard Peeperkorn of the World Health Organisation said \u201cwe did not see an impact on the humanitarian supplies coming in\u201d. Hisham Salem in Jabalia camp told AFP: \u201cThe markets... used to be full, but now there is nothing left. I go around the entire market and I can\u2019t find a kilo of onions, and if I do... it costs 140 shekels ($37).\u201d Dr. Thanos Gargavanis, a WHO trauma surgeon and emergency officer, said the UN in Gaza was trying to \u201coperate in an unworkable environment\u201d. According to the WHO, only 17 of the 36 hospitals in Gaza are operational, but only partially. It said that as of May 17, just 750 people remained in Rafah city where previously 1.4 million people had been sheltering. Israel\u2019s military on Friday identified two more soldiers killed in Gaza, bringing to at least 312 killed since ground operations began. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges which he denies, faces regular street protests accusing him of prolonging the war, and demanding an agreement to free the hostages. \u2018Vexing\u2019 comments But Netanyahu told relatives of captives killed in Gaza: \u201cWe will not leave the Gaza Strip until all of the hostages return.\u201d On Thursday he said he was \u201cprepared to suffer personal attacks provided that Israel receives the ammunition from the US that it needs in the war for its existence\u201d. His statement came as an apparent doubling down after he made a video statement accusing Washington of \u201cwithholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel\u201d. The White House on Thursday described his comments as \u201cvexing\u201d and \u201cdisappointing\u201d. Except for one shipment, \u201cthere are no other pauses. None,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, referring to one paused delivery of 907-kilo bombs. The war has revived a global push for Palestinians to be given a state of their own. Armenia on Friday declared its recognition of \u201cthe State of Palestine\u201d, prompting Israel to summon its ambassador for \u201ca severe reprimand\u201d.", "summary": "<!-- google_ad_section_start --><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p>GAZA STRIP \u2014 Israel bombed the Gaza Strip where one hospital reported at least 30 dead on Friday and as exchanges of fire and threats over the Lebanon border raised fears of an even wider war.</p>\n<p>After further cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hizbollah movement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the clashes must not turn Lebanon into \"another Gaza\".</p>\n<p>Increased \u201cbellicose rhetoric\u201d from both sides risked triggering a catastrophe \u201cbeyond imagination\u201d, he said.</p>\n<p>In Gaza the director of Gaza City\u2019s Al Ahli hospital was quoted by the territory\u2019s health ministry as reporting 30 dead on Friday in intensified Israeli bombardment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has been a difficult and brutal day in Gaza City.

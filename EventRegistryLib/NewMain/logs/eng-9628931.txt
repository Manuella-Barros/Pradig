Ismail Musa Modibo.\n\nThe House noted the distressing incident on Monday, 3rd June 2024, where over a hundred miners working with a mining entity, Africa Minerals and Logistics Company Limited were tragically trapped within a rocky mining pit.\n\nIt noted that all efforts to rescue the victims were in vain, necessitating immediate federal intervention.\n\nThe House said it was aware of the presence of both state and federal distress response teams at the collapsed mining pit.\n\nIt expressed grave concern over the report of the death of many miners during the rescue operations.\n\nThe House emphasized the critical need for the deployment of more special rescue experts to the site to prevent the victims from further loss of life.\n\nIt worried that the lack of adequate safety measures and emergency equipment by the mining companies led to the unfortunate situation.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_segun_olatunji@tribuneonlineng.com", "name": "Jacob Segun Olatunji", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiroro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiroro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Niger State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Niger State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Associations", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Mining", "wgt": 44}], "image": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/01-reps-2-e1710333809180.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628931", "eventUri": "eng-9628931", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

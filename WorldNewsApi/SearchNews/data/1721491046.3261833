Dozens of bottles of cherries and berries \u2013 impossibly preserved in storage pits uncovered from the cellar of his mansion on the banks of the Potomac River \u2013 were discovered during an archaeological dig connected to a restoration project. Jason Boroughs, Mount Vernon\u2019s principal archaeologist, said the discovery of so much perfectly preserved food from more than 250 years ago is essentially unprecedented. \u201cFinding what is essentially fresh fruit, 250 years later, is pretty spectacular,\u201d Boroughs said in an interview. \u201cAll the stars sort of have to align in the right manner for that to happen.\u201d Whole pieces of fruit, recognizable as cherries, were found in some of the bottles. Other bottles held what appear to be gooseberries or currants, though testing is underway to confirm that. Mount Vernon is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is conducting DNA testing on the fruit. They are also examining more than 50 cherry pits recovered from the bottles to see if any of them can be planted. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a long shot,\u201d said Benjamin Gutierrez, a USDA plant geneticist, of the chances of using a cherry pit to grow a tree. Seeds preserve best when they are dry, and most of the samples found at Mount Vernon were waterlogged. A couple of pits tested initially were not viable as seeds. Still, Gutierrez said the bottles are a remarkable find. In addition to DNA testing, he said chemical testing may be able to show if particular spices were used to preserve the fruits. Records at Mount Vernon show that George and Martha Washington were fond of cherries, at least when mixed with brandy. Martha Washington\u2019s recipe for a \u201ccherry bounce\u201d cocktail survives, and George Washington wrote that he took a canteen of cherry bounce with him on a trip across the Alleghenies in 1784. These cherries, though, were most likely bottled to be eaten simply as cherries, Boroughs said. The quality of the preservation reflect a high caliber of work. Slaves ran the plantation\u2019s kitchen. The kitchen was overseen by an enslaved woman named Doll, who came to Mount Vernon in 1758 with Martha Washington, according to the estate. \u201cThe enslaved folks who were taking care of the trees, picking the fruit, working in the kitchen \u2013 those would have been the folks that probably would have overseen and done this process,\u201d Boroughs said. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly skilled process. Otherwise, they just wouldn\u2019t have survived this way.\u201d The bottles were found only because Mount Vernon is doing a $40 million revitalization project of the mansion, which is expected to be completed by the nation\u2019s 250th birthday in 2026. \u201cWhen we do archaeology, it\u2019s destructive,\u201d Boroughs said. \u201cSo unless we have a reason to disturb those resources, we tend not to.\u201d \u201cIn this case, because of these needed structural repairs to the mansion, the ground was going to be disturbed. So we looked there first,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect to find all this.\u201d The experts know that the bottles predate 1775 because that\u2019s when an expansion of the mansion led to the area being covered over with a brick floor. Mount Vernon announced back in April, at the start of its archaeological work, that it had found two bottles. As the dig continued, the number increased to 35 in six distinct storage pits. Six of the bottles were broken, with the other 29 intact. Twelve held cherries, 16 held the other berries believed to be currants and gooseberries, and one larger bottle held both cherries and other berries. Boroughs believes they have now uncovered all the cherries and berries that survived. \u201cThere is a lot of information that we\u2019re excited to get from these bottles,\u201d he said. \u00ab Previous", "summary": "The dozens of bottles of centuries-old, impeccably preserved cherries and berries were discovered during an archaeological dig connected to a restoration project.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/06/17/no-lie-perfectly-preserved-centuries-old-cherries-unearthed-at-george-washingtons-mount-vernon/", "image": "https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/George_Washington_Cherries_44843_ae4700-1718670037.jpg?w=1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:18:24", "author": "Matthew Barakat,MATTHEW BARAKAT - Associated Press", "authors": ["Matthew Barakat", "MATTHEW BARAKAT - Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.042}

{"id": 223741290, "title": "Abortion Bounties, Penalties on Women: Florida Kingmaker\u2019s Candidate Questionnaire", "text": "The influential Florida Family Policy Council, a fixture in Tallahassee since its founding in 2004, likes to claim credit for such political triumphs as the state law banning gay marriage, defunding Planned Parenthood, and forcing the state board of education to teach students evolution is merely a theory, not a fact. The group\u2019s annual gala has become a pitstop for Republican candidates seeking the organization\u2019s favor \u2014 then-Gov. Jeb Bush was the keynote speaker in 2006; in 2023, it\u2019s where Gov. Ron DeSantis made his last big appearance before announcing he was running for president \u2014 and in a state where redistricting has made general election seats less and less competitive, an endorsement from the group\u2019s advocacy and lobbying arm, Florida Family Action, can help crown the Republican candidate in the primary. That group is gearing up to endorse a new slate of favorites for state House and Senate this year, and is asking candidates seeking its backing to fill out a 44-question questionnaire \u2014 paperwork that often functions as a litmus test to determine whether a candidate shares the endorsing group\u2019s values. Florida Family Action\u2019s 2024 survey, obtained by Rolling Stone, offers a glimpse of the future the influential lobbying group would like to see in the state. (Florida Family Action did not respond to requests for comment about the candidate survey.) In addition to collecting standard information about the educational candidate\u2019s background, military service, and other credentials, the questionnaire asks political hopefuls about additional restrictions they might seek to implement on abortion, which is currently banned in Florida after 6 weeks. The group asks if there ought to be penalties for women who seek abortion, and whether abortion should to be banned at fertilization; floats the idea of implementing a Texas-style abortion bounty law in Florida, discusses defunding government programs that offer access to contraceptives and birth control; and questions candidates about regulating in vitro fertilization, or IVF. There are also questions about whether the state should ban the use of bathrooms and other facilities by trans people, whether \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201csexual orientation\u201d should be added to the state\u2019s non-discrimination statute, whether the state has a role in \u201cprohibiting or regulating certain sexual behaviors,\u201d and whether certain drugs should be decriminalized or legalized. (Amendment 3, which would legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Florida, is slated to appear on the ballot this November.) Question 18 of the survey asks: \u201cShould the law ever penalize any woman who has an abortion?\u201d Candidates may select among the options: \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cUnsure;\u201d there is also a space for comments. For decades, even the more extreme anti-abortion groups opposed criminalizing or otherwise punishing women seeking an abortion, focusing their attention on penalizing abortion providers instead. But that has seemed to change since 2016, when presidential candidate Donald Trump insisted \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for a woman seeking an abortion. Trump later backed away from the statement, but since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, lawmakers in South Carolina and Alabama have considered imposing penalties \u2014 including the death penalty \u2014 on women seeking abortions. Question 19 on the survey ponders the possibility of implementing an abortion bounty law in the state, much like S.B. 8, the Texas law that effectively shut down abortion access in the state nine months before Roe v. Wade was overturned. It allows individuals to sue, for monetary damages, anyone suspected of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d an abortion. (The survey asks: \u201cIf state attorneys and law enforcement agencies in certain areas of Florida refuse to enforce state abortion laws against abortion providers, do you believe there should be a private enforcement mechanism, using lawsuits by private citizens and civil causes of action with monetary damages to enforce pro-life laws against abortion providers?\u201d) The questionnaire also asks, \u201cIs it the proper role of government to fund contraceptives and forms of birth control?\u201d and \u201cDo you believe the state should regulate in vitro fertilization? Why or why not?\u201d It also includes two questions about pornography \u2014 whether porn constitutes \u201cprotected speech under the first amendment and thus cannot be subjected to excessive governmental regulation,\u201d and whether there ought to be fines levied or private lawsuits filed against \u201cschool districts that allow and use pornographic or sexually explicit materials in school instruction or in school libraries.\u201d In 2022, Florida Family Action threw its weight behind DeSantis, as well as Trump 2024 vice presidential shortlist contenders Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Byron Donalds, and 58 candidates for state House and Senate. This year, candidates likely to seek the group\u2019s backing include Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna.

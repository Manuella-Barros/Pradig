{"id": 225008376, "title": "Is a shortage of computing teachers a growing threat to Scotland's economy?", "text": "A crisis in the teaching of computing science in Scotland has been laid bare by experts who fear a series of alarming trends represent a threat to the nation\u2019s economy. The Reform Scotland think-tank published a report on Wednesday showing more than 32,000 children - one in eight of all secondary pupils - attend a secondary school with no qualified computing science teacher. The figure rises to around 50 per cent of schools in some more rural parts of Scotland. A total of 66 secondary schools were found to have no computing science teacher, while the number of such teachers across Scotland has fallen by a quarter since 2008. Meanwhile, 25 secondary schools with a roll above 1,000 pupils have only one qualified computing science teacher. The trend is set to continue, with The Scotsman recently reporting how there were just 16 students studying to be computing teachers on professional graduate diploma in education (PGDE) courses, against a target of 52. Gareth Williams, a founder of Skyscanner and a Reform Scotland trustee, said: \u201cCountries that lag behind in enhancing the computational skills of their workforce will increasingly struggle to compete in the modern world. \u201cIt is vital that we address the issues impeding children's education in computer science, and that Scotland wakes up to how important this is.\u201d Professor Mark Logan published a review for the Scottish Government in 2020 into how the technology sector could contribute to the country\u2019s economic recovery after the pandemic. He raised similar concerns while giving evidence to Holyrood\u2019s education committee on Wednesday. The Glasgow University professor said: \u201cWe have computing science deserts in Scotland. In the north of Scotland [Highland] half of our schools have no qualified computing science teacher. \u201cIn the south of Scotland, two-thirds of our schools [ten out of 16 in Dumfries and Galloway] have no qualified computing science teacher. That adds up to a bad, static picture. I mean, to me it sounds like a crisis. But it is worse than that, because you\u2019ve got to look at the trends with these things. \u201cTeacher numbers since 2008 have fallen by 25 per cent. This year we are at our lowest number of computing science teachers on record - we had 766 in 2008 and we have 578 now.\u201d Prof Logan said there were about eight times more computing science teachers over the age of 55 as under 25. \u201cYou can see, if you intersect these different aspects - recruitment falling, demographic timebomb, a lot of departments have one computing science teacher so are very vulnerable - we are in difficulty, I think it\u2019s fair to say,\u201d Prof Logan said. On Monday, The Scotsman featured an initiative launched by Robert Gordon\u2019s College in Aberdeen, which offers SQA Higher computing courses to pupils across Scotland, as part of an online learning resource. The Scottish Government funds a teaching bursary scheme that provides \u00a320,000 for career changers wishing to undertake a one-year PGDE in hard-to-fill-in subjects such as maths, physics and computing science. The Strategic Board for Teacher Education is also considering issues around the recruitment to initial teacher education programmes and retention of teachers in Scotland in detail, including geographical and subject-specific issues, together with work to improve the promotion of teaching as a valued career.", "summary": "<p>One in eight pupils attend a secondary with no computing teacher</p>", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/education/is-a-shortage-of-computing-teachers-a-threat-to-scotlands-economy-4645703", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/05/29/8/20/technician.JPG.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:02:09", "author": "Calum Ross", "authors": ["Calum Ross"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.314}

The Corbally man is back on Limerick City and County Council for the second time - almost trebling his vote from 2019. \"I'm over the moon, I'm numbed, I'm shocked. I never expected to have this level of an endorsement,\" a jubilant Cllr Sheehan said, surrounded by his supporters. He believes his haul is the highest vote Labour has received north of the Shannon in three decades. \"It's up to me to go out there to work tirelessly night and day for the people who have elected to make sure they feel their vote is well used,\" he added. Cllr Sheehan praised his team for being out \"night and day\" campaigning for him. \"To get people to go out and ask them to vote for you is a daunting thing. I'd be nothing without my Labour party team. The Labour vote across the city is up - at 11%. In my view, Labour are on the way up in Limerick again. It's up to myself, Joe and Elena to make sure we work tirelessly for people to ensure we deliver for them.\" The 30-year old also contested this year's historic mayoral election.

{"id": 243277872, "title": "Martin Mull, actor who starred in \u2018Roseanne' and \u2018Two and a Half Men,' dies at 80", "text": "Martin Mull, whose droll, esoteric comedy and acting made him a hip sensation in the 1970s and later a beloved guest star on sitcoms including \u201cRoseanne\u201d and \u201cArrested Development,\u201d has died, his daughter said Friday. Mull's Daughter, TV writer and comic artist Maggie Mull, said her father died at home on Thursday after \u201ca valiant fight against a long illness.\u201d Mull, who was also a guitarist and painter, came to national fame with a recurring role on the Norman Lear-created satirical soap opera \u201cMary Hartman, Mary Hartman,\u201d and the starring role in its spinoff, \u201cFernwood Tonight.\" \u201cHe was known for excelling at every creative discipline imaginable and also for doing Red Roof Inn commercials,\u201d Maggie Mull said in an Instagram post. \u201cHe would find that joke funny. He was never not funny. My dad will be deeply missed by his wife and daughter, by his friends and coworkers, by fellow artists and comedians and musicians, and\u2014the sign of a truly exceptional person\u2014by many, many dogs.\u201d Known for his blonde hair and well-trimmed mustache, Mull was born in Chicago, raised in Ohio and Connecticut and studied art in Rhode Island and Rome. His first foray into show business was as a songwriter, penning the 1970 semi-hit \u201cA Girl Named Johnny Cash\u201d for singer Jane Morgan. He would combine music and comedy in an act that he brought to hip Hollywood clubs in the 1970s. \u201cIn 1976 I was a guitar player and sit-down comic appearing at the Roxy on the Sunset Strip when Norman Lear walked in and heard me,\" Mull told The Associated Press in 1980. \u201cHe cast me as the wife beater on \u2018Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\u2019 Four months later I was spun off on my own show.\u201d His time on the Strip was memorialized in the 1973 country rock classic \u201cLonesome L.A. Cowboy\" where the Riders of the Purple Sage give him a shoutout along with music luminaries Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge. \u201cI know Kris and Rita and Marty Mull are hangin' at the Troubadour,\u201d the song says. On \u201cFernwood Tonight\u201d (sometimes styled as \u201cFernwood 2 Night\u201d), he played Barth Gimble, the host of a local talk show in a midwestern town and twin to his \u201cMary Hartman\u201d character. Fred Willard, a frequent collaborator with very similar comic sensibilities, played his sidekick. It was later revamped as \u201cAmerica 2 Night\u201d and set in Southern California. He would get to be a real talk show host as a substitute for Johnny Carson on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\" Mull often played slightly sleazy, somewhat slimy and often smarmy characters as he did as Teri Garr's boss and Michael Keaton's foe in 1983's \u201cMr. Mom.\u201d He played Colonel Mustard in the 1985 movie adaptation of the board game \u201cClue,\u201d which, like many things Mull appeared in, has become a cult classic. The 1980s also brought what many thought was his best work, \u201cA History of White People in America,\u201d a mockumentary that first aired on Cinemax. Mull co-created the show and starred as a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d style investigative reporter investigating all things milquetoast and mundane. Willard was again a co-star. He wrote and starred in 1988's \u201cRented Lips\" alongside Robert Downey Jr., whose father, Robert Sr., directed. His co-star Jennifer Tilly said in an X post Friday that Mull was \u201csuch a witty charismatic and kind person.\u201d In the 1990s he was best known for his recurring role on several seasons on \u201cRoseanne,\u201d in which he played a warmer, less sleazy boss to the title character, an openly gay man whose partner was played by Willard, who died in 2020. Mull would later play private eye Gene Parmesan on \u201cArrested Development,\u201d a cult-classic character on a cult-classic show, and would be nominated for an Emmy, his first, in 2016 for a guest run on \u201cVeep.\u201d \u201cWhat I did on \u2018Veep\u2019 I\u2019m very proud of, but I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s probably more collective, at my age it\u2019s more collective,\u201d Mull told the AP after his nomination. \u201cIt might go all the way back to \u2018Fernwood.\u2019\u201d Other comedians and actors were often his biggest fans. \u201cMartin was the greatest,\u201d \u201cBridesmaids\u201d director Paul Feig said on X. \u201cSo funny, so talented, such a nice guy. Was lucky enough to act with him on The Jackie Thomas Show and treasured every moment being with a legend. Fernwood Tonight was so influential in my life.\u201d Mull is survived by his daughter and musician Wendy Haas, his wife since 1982.", "summary": "<p>Martin Mull, whose droll, esoteric comedy and acting made him a hip sensation in the 1970s and later a beloved guest star on\u00a0sitcoms\u00a0including \u201cRoseanne\u201d and \u201cArrested Development,\u201d has died, his daughter said Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mull&#8217;s Daughter, TV writer and comic artist Maggie Mull, said her father died at home on Thursday after \u201ca valiant fight against a long illness.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mull, who was also a guitarist and painter, came to national fame with a recurring role on the Norman Lear-created satirical soap opera \u201cMary Hartman, Mary Hartman,\u201d and the starring role in its spinoff, \u201cFernwood Tonight.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe was known for excelling at every creative discipline imaginable and also for doing Red Roof Inn commercials,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mulltoons/\">Maggie Mull said in an Instagram post</a>. \u201cHe would find that joke funny.

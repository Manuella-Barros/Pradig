There will be no more so-called daylight saving time, which was artificially created to make more efficient use of daylight.\n\nThis decision was made by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on July 16 by voting for draft law No. 4201. Thus, Ukraine will have a single Kyiv time, different from Moscow time. OBOZ.UA explains what time Ukraine has chosen and why it has abandoned daylight saving time.\n\nWinter time is standard, i.e. the main time, and summer time is artificial and temporary, which is set in a certain territory for the summer period of the year (usually one hour longer than the standard time). In addition, daylight saving time is not used in all countries. 140 countries have never used seasonal time or have abandoned this practice. The European Parliament has also supported the idea of abolishing seasonal time change.\n\nOn the map, the countries that currently use daylight saving time are marked in blue; those that have abolished daylight saving time are marked in orange; and those that have never used it are marked in red.\n\nWhat will change in Ukraine\n\nUkraine is now in the third time zone, UTC+3, as it switched to Eastern European Summer Time (EEST) on March 31. The time was moved forward by one hour from 03:00 to 04:00 local time.\n\nStarting from October 27, 2024, Ukraine will always have UTC+2/Eastern European Time (EET), i.e. two hours plus to Greenwich Mean Time.\n\nWhat is stated in the bill:\n\n- Kyiv time will be in effect in all Ukrainian settlements throughout the year;\n\n- the document additionally aims to protect the territorial integrity and strengthen the national security of Ukraine, as Russia's time is set in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine;\n\n- the refusal to switch to daylight saving time will reduce the risks to the health of Ukrainians, as most scientists believe that the annual switching of clocks forward and backward by one hour has many negative consequences;\n\n- Ukraine is implementing a \"time reform\" based on a similar EU initiative, so it is in line with the logic of European integration;\n\n- the draft law also states that changing the clocks does not help energy saving.\n\nFailed attempts to cancel daylight saving time\n\nUkraine has already had attempts to abandon daylight saving time. The first serious attempt to change from winter to summer time was made by the Party of Regions in 2011. The political party wanted to copy the changes in Russia, where they decided to switch to daylight saving time and cancel further seasonal time changes.\n\nOn September 20, 2011, the Rada's resolution canceled the return to standard time. People in the western regions were unhappy with this decision, as they would have to go to work and take their children to school in the dark. A month later, the resolution was canceled.\n\nAfter that, the idea of canceling daylight saving time was revisited in 2021. At that time, the parliament adopted in the first reading the draft law No. 4201 \"On Timekeeping in Ukraine\". However, the draft law was not adopted in the second reading.\n\nThe motivation of MPs\n\nNow, with daylight saving time, Kyiv time coincides with Moscow time. In Russia, the annual time change was canceled in 2011, when the country remained in permanent daylight saving time. In 2014, it switched to permanent winter time.\n\nExplaining the benefits of abolishing daylight saving time, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk recalled that in the first days after Russia annexed Crimea, the first thing it did was to introduce \"Moscow time\" there.\n\nHe noted that this is not a matter of feeling but of state policy. \"And when someone says that time zones are parallel lines, please look: there are no parallel lines anywhere. There is always a geopolitical dimension. Any time zone is a geopolitical dimension,\" the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada emphasized.\n\nHe also noted that he does not know people who feel happy about adjusting their biological clocks twice a year because of the time change.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Standard time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daylight saving time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC+3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UTC+3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC+2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UTC+2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruslan_Stefanchuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruslan Stefanchuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Regions", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party of Regions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/7/17/e07ca4e7-61e9-4c5f-8af6-eb0adaf14267.png?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748194", "eventUri": "eng-9748194", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 301, "textEnd": 308}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 1290, "textEnd": 1298}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-09-20", "textStart": 2636, "textEnd": 2654}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Accordingly, the abolition of daylight saving time will not lead to changes in Ukraine's energy system.\n\nVolodymyr Omelchenko, director of energy programs at the Razumkov Center, told OBOZ.UA. According to him, the idea of daylight saving time arose back in the days of the founder of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, to save electricity.\n\nInitially, this concept spread to many countries, but now most countries have abandoned the seasonal change to summer and winter time. \"In my opinion, I don't see any serious impact on the energy sector and resource consumption, and I think that there are no big savings from switching the clocks and there won't be any,\" Omelchenko said.\n\nHe also emphasized that switching the clocks negatively affects people's health by disrupting their biological rhythms. \"Medical institutes once conducted research on this topic, and it was proven that it has a negative impact on health,\" he added.\n\nOmelchenko's opinion is also supported by Serhiy Fursa, an investment banker. In his opinion, this transition has long been an atavism that has no economic justification in the modern world.\n\n\"It was invented 100 years ago, motivated by the fact that it could help save electricity. But this happened in a completely different world, the industrial world. In today's world of information technology, in today's post-industrial society, there are no studies that would indicate that it helps to save anything. There just isn't,\" Fursa said.\n\nHe added that the economy has nothing to lose from the abolition of daylight saving time, and on the contrary, it can gain. \"A blow to the nation's health is always a blow to the economy. The tie-in to blackouts would be appropriate if studies were confirming that in the modern world, daylight saving time allows you to save money. But there are none. Therefore, leaving the same time for the whole year is quite logical,\" Fursa summarized.\n\nA new bill to abolish daylight saving time has been passed\n\nAccording to the new law, Ukraine will abolish daylight saving time in the fall of 2024.

The bill was backed by 261 votes but it still needs a presidential signature to become law.\n\nThe recently passed legislation was also meant to unify standards across Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression and occupation.\n\nWhile Ukraine belongs to the Eastern European time zone (UTC+2:00, or UTC+3:00 during summer time), Russia began to enforce the de facto use of Moscow Standard Time (UTC+3:00 without using daylight saving time) in the occupied territories.\n\nAfter October this year, Ukraine will fix its time zone at UTC+2:00.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daylight saving time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC+3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UTC+3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC+2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UTC+2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1363421954.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748194", "eventUri": "eng-9748194", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 101, "textEnd": 108}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

If enacted, the resolution would urge the U.S. Congress to pass the \"Sunshine Protection Act,\" a bill to transition to perpetual daylight saving nationwide.\n\nReps. Rodney Creech (R-West Alexandria) and Bob Peterson (R-Sabina), the bill's primary sponsors, argued during the June hearing that the U.S. no longer needs the biannual tradition of changing clocks. The lawmakers pointed to various studies that say moving clocks forward in the spring and back in the fall causes a number of work, school, safety and sleep-related issues.\n\n\"Continuing to change the time results in a higher number of cardiac issues and strokes and prolonged seasonal depression,\" Creech said. \"A recent study revealed that sleep loss, even for as little as one hour, can decrease a child's quality of life, showing significant negative impacts on the children's physical well-being as well as their ability to cope with the school environment.\"\n\nOne study said adult workers on average sleep 40 minutes less, have 5.7% more workplace injuries, and lose 67.6% more work days because of injuries the day following the spring shift than on other days. Another, after researching 21 years of fatal accidents in the U.S., found a significant increase in accidents on the Monday following the spring forward and another increase on the Sunday after the fall back.\n\nHowever, Jay Pea, president of the nonprofit Save Standard Time, said in a previous hearing last year that daylight saving would delay Ohio's sunrise past 8 a.m. for more than four months, sometimes as late as 9:06 a.m., and noted Ohio rejected an effort in 1974 to enact daylight saving permanently. Rather, Pea advocates for extending standard time to the entire year.\n\n\"Permanent standard time would protect start times for schoolchildren and essential workers by letting most sleep naturally past dawn year-round. Its benefits to circadian health would improve immunity, longevity, mood, alertness, and performance in school, sports, and work,\" Pea said. \"Standard time is the natural clock, set to the sun.\"\n\nCreech and Peterson noted, while daylight saving was instituted during World War I to conserve power, a 2008 Australian study found adjusting clocks twice a year does not reduce electricity consumption after all. Rather, researchers found the time change only caused a \"shift in demand consistent with activity patterns that are tied to the clock rather than sunrise and sunset.\"\n\n\"Changing clocks twice a year did not save any power at all, nor did it lead to behavioral change as people do not adjust their schedules based on outdoor lighting,\" Peterson said. \"Instead, those researchers found that modern schedules are fixed to clocks, not the sun.\"\n\nThe lawmaker's resolution notes an effort to enact daylight saving in Ohio would be curtailed until federal law changes. Under the Uniform Time Act of 1966, states can change to standard time but not daylight saving, which requires a change to federal law to transition to perpetual daylight saving.\n\nPassing the Sunshine Protection Act would mean later sunsets in the winter, but also later sunrises. For example, the sun rises around 7:15 a.m. and sets around 4:30 p.m. on the first day of winter in New York. The Sunshine Protection Act would change sunrise to 8:15 a.m. and sunset to 5:30 p.m.\n\nWhile many other states have also hinted at permanently observing daylight saving, states like New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee want to observe standard time. Six in 10 Americans, 61%, would do away with the nation's twice-a-year time change while a little over one-third, 35%, want to keep the current practice, according to a Monmouth University poll.",

Source: Freepik\n\nThe Ukrainian parliament has canceled daylight saving time, and this should have a positive impact on the health of Ukrainians. The stability of the time zone will minimize the impact of changes in the length of daylight hours on the human body and will not cause artificial harm.\n\nThis was stated by Daryna Lopushnyan, a general practitioner, in a comment to OBOZ.UA. She explained that our body has its own biological rhythms, which we adjust to the outside world.\n\nAny external changes, including time changes, cause the body to malfunction. They cause a stressful reaction, poor sleep, decreased concentration, and mood changes.\n\nAccording to her, the greatest harm was done to the elderly and children, as they have lower adaptive capacities.\n\n\"Children become tired, irritated and exhausted, lose efficiency and quality of mental activity. In older people, existing chronic diseases are added to the mix, increasing the risk of their exacerbation and complications, such as hypertension, strokes, and heart attacks,\" the doctor explained.\n\nShe added that the time change artificially created additional harm to the human body. After this action was canceled, the impact of the change in daylight hours on the human body will be minimal.\n\nEarlier, Olha Maslova, PhD in Biology, explained that discomfort during the seasonal time change is experienced primarily by people with cardiovascular problems.\n\n\"There have been several studies on strokes and cardiovascular disease. They prove that mortality on the days of time change, especially in spring, increases with such problems,\" Maslova said.\n\nAt the same time, scientists from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) emphasize that constant standard time is the best choice for health and safety. Therefore, they call for the abolition of seasonal time change. Scientists explain that the rejection of seasonal time changes is better aligned with human biological rhythms.\n\nAs OBOZ.UA previously reported, on October 27, 2024, Ukraine will change its clocks for the last time - to winter time, which is standard. There will be no more switching to the so-called daylight saving time, which was artificially created to make more efficient use of daylight.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daylight saving time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General practitioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronobiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronobiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Sleep_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Academy of Sleep Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/7/18/14110f8c0e9a3d353628c8cba0829650dfd1200x675.jpeg?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748194", "eventUri": "eng-9748194", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The country ended up switching to year-round \"winter time\" in 2014 instead.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruslan_Stefanchuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruslan Stefanchuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Servant of the People"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Deputy_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Deputy of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daylight saving time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnieper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dnieper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy conservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltava", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poltava"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Poltava"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzhhorod", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uzhhorod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uzhhorod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/6697eb4720302771024eaef7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748194", "eventUri": "eng-9748194", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-27", "textStart": 1590, "textEnd": 1600}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

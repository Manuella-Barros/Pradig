They were not meant for the common man, either. In early civilisations, umbrellas\u2014made from palm leaves, feathers, or other natural materials\u2014were symbols of rank and luxury, carried by servants to protect royalty and nobility from the sun. \u201cChhatra means protection,\u201d shared Aziz Currim, citing the title \u2018Chhatrapati\u2019 used by Shivaji Maharaj, founder of Maratha kingdom, as testimony. Sharing another anecdote, he said, \u201cIn fact, in the 18th century, women in London were using umbrellas but men were not. They saw the use of an umbrella as effeminate and unmanly. Jonas Hanway was the first man who started using them and was mocked for it but he persisted. By the 19th century, umbrellas had become a mark of social status and sophistication.\u201d Aziz, 80, represents the fourth generation running Ebrahim Currim and Sons, a 164-year-old establishment in South Bombay, considered the oldest umbrella manufacturer in the country. It was Aziz\u2019s great-grandfather Ebrahim who opened a small shop on Bazar Gate Street, Fort, in 1860, dealing in umbrellas imported from England. In 1902, his three sons Rahimbhaji, Ramjanally, and Goolamally joined the business, establishing the National Umbrella Factory. His eldest son even travelled to Europe to learn the manufacturing process, and soon they started producing umbrellas under various brands, including the still-popular Stag, among other brands like Peacock, Sheep, Canopy and Dragon, some of which lost popularity along the way. The umbrellas were initially made with silk cloth covered in wax on a bamboo or cane frame. Then came waterproof cotton and metal parts made in brass, followed by nylon and steel, and then polyester. \u201cEighty per cent of the market currently uses polyester because it is cheaper, but most of our production is done in nylon because it is better,\u201d shared Aziz. As demand grew, the family moved to larger premises for both sales and manufacturing. They currently operate from a three-storey building on Princess Street, Kalbadevi, with a manufacturing unit in Sewri. They also established retail units in Calicut (Kochi), Madras (Chennai), and Mangalore (Mangaluru). \u201cThe monsoon winds in India approach from the southwest, bringing heavy rainfall to states on the western coast like Maharashtra. After hitting the Himalayas, the southwest monsoon retreats, and the northeast monsoon winds pick up, bringing rainfall to the southeastern coast, particularly Tamil Nadu. Kerala receives rainfall in both seasons. My forefathers tried covering both coasts,\u201d shared Aziz, who joined the business as a young boy of seven. \u201cMy father wanted me to learn the trade early. He made me start at the gate where I would stamp buyers\u2019 bills, then moved me to the sales, followed by customer care and the factory before I could design my own umbrellas,\u201d he shared. He designed his first corporate umbrella at 21. \u201cThere were no corporate umbrellas then. A golf tournament was happening, so I suggested designing an umbrella with their logo. The owner agreed, and we created a red and yellow cotton umbrella with the company\u2019s logo. It was perhaps the first corporate umbrella,\u201d he shared, adding that his company has been a pioneer and innovator, creating the first two-fold umbrella. \u201cWhen competitors copied, we introduced three-fold, then four-fold, and five-fold umbrellas. We also designed magic umbrellas that changed colour and perfume umbrellas that released fragrance in the rain. I also created a bodyguard umbrella for women that sounds a loud siren to call for help.\u201d One of his early designs, Shahenshah, inspired by an Amitabh Bachchan movie, is still in demand and is retailed at Rs 850. The umbrella is large enough for two people. An additional cover, priced at Rs 100, with shoulder straps can be helpful to carry it around while minimising the chances of it being left in autos and trains. In his office on the third floor, there is a framed umbrella. When asked about it, Aziz shared a story about a gentleman who came to the store asking to repair the said umbrella. \u201cWhen we saw it, we offered him as many umbrellas as the man wanted in exchange. It was an umbrella from 1902 with original brass frames. We got it framed,\u201d he said. A man full of stories, Aziz recounts another anecdote involving Ratan Tata, who visited the store two decades ago. \u201cI could not believe it at first but then went downstairs and he was there. I asked him what he was looking for and he said he needed an umbrella for his pool and he knew we were the best. I designed four special umbrellas for him and sent them to his home. He kept one but the gentleman that he is, the payment came for all four of them,\u201d Aziz recalled. Asked about the market and how it has changed, Aziz gets philosophical. \u201cThe market is always turbulent, constantly changing, and nowadays, it changes very fast. But it is like a game of chess; you make a move, others make theirs, and you hope to continue as long as you can,\u201d he said. Though repair work is dwindling, Ebrahim Currim and Sons still repairs umbrellas, offering a one-year warranty and even repairing older umbrellas out of sentimental value. Aziz\u2019s most prized repair was for an umbrella belonging to the father of the Indian nuclear programme, Homi J Bhabha, restored with the finest silk for auction without charge, as a contribution to the cause. Recently, the company created a website and social media accounts, and going forward, the plan is to set up an e-commerce platform.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/ebrahim-currim-164-old-umbrella-brand-aziz-currim-mumbai-kalbadevi-9422194/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/ebrahhim-currim-3.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:39:30", "author": "Heena Khandelwal", "authors": ["Heena Khandelwal"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.125}

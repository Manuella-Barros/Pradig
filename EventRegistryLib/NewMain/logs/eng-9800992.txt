Oslo's \"anti-Israel behaviour\" since the Gaza\n\nwar began in October.\n\nNorway has long been a facilitator in the Middle East peace process,\n\nparticularly leading to the 1993 Oslo Accords, and it swifty reacted to\n\nKatz's announcement which Oslo said \"will have consequences\".\n\nThe Israeli minister said he \"ordered the termination of any representation\n\non behalf of the Norwegian Embassy in Israel vis-a-vis the Palestinian\n\nAuthority,\" which has partial administrative power in the Israeli-occupied\n\nWest Bank.\n\n\"There is a price for anti-Israel behaviour,\" Katz added in a statement,\n\nciting Norway's recent recognition of a Palestinian state and backing of a\n\npending International Criminal Court case implicating Israeli leaders in\n\nalleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nA separate statement mentioned \"serious statements by senior Norwegian\n\nofficials\" that the foreign ministry viewed as anti-Israeli.\n\nThe ministry statement said it would revoke the diplomatic status of \"eight\n\nNorwegian diplomats... whose duties were to represent Norway vis-a-vis the\n\nPalestinian Authority\".\n\nIn an official note delivered Thursday to the Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv,\n\nthe Israeli foreign ministry said the envoys' diplomatic status \"shall be\n\nrevoked seven days after the date of this note\".\n\nThe note accused Norway of \"one-sided policies and statements\" since the\n\nOctober 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas that sparked\n\nthe war in the Gaza Strip 10 months ago.\n\nIn May, Israel had ordered Spain's consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering\n\nconsular services to Palestinians from the occupied West Bank from June 1, a\n\n\"punitive\" measure for Madrid's recognition of a Palestinian state, Katz said\n\nat the time.\n\nSpain, Ireland and Norway had earlier announced their decision to recognise a\n\nPalestinian state, which Israel's government opposes.\n\nRecognition by the three countries brought to 146 the number of UN member\n\nstates recognising a Palestinian state.\n\n- 'Extreme action' -\n\nNorway on August 5 ruled that the International Criminal Court had\n\njurisdiction over Palestinian territories and that it should go ahead with\n\nproceedings in its case for arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders\n\nover the Gaza war.\n\nIn June, Norway announced it would increase its funding to the UN agency for\n\nPalestinian refugees (UNRWA) by 100 million kroner ($9.3 million).\n\nThe agency provides more assistance in education, relief and development in\n\nGaza than any other organisation, but Israel has alleged UNRWA employs\n\nhundreds of \"terrorists\" among its thousands of Gaza employees.\n\n\"This is an extreme action that first and foremost affects our ability to\n\nhelp the Palestinian population\", Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide\n\nsaid in a statement following Katz's announcement.\n\n\"We are considering what measures Norway will take to respond to the\n\nsituation that the (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu government has now\n\ncreated\", the statement added.\n\nNorway hosted secret Israeli-Palestinian talks in the Norwegian capital that\n\nled to the Oslo Accords signed in Washington in 1993.\n\nThey established a limited degree of Palestinian self-rule, and were intended\n\nas an interim measure that would lead to Palestinian statehood, but talks\n\ntapered off.\n\nForeign leaders have warned that the expansion of Israeli settlements,\n\nconsidered illegal by the international community, threatens the viability of\n\na Palestinian state.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [],

status of Norway envoys to Palestinians - Times of India", "body": "JERUSALEM: Israel said Thursday it was revoking the diplomatic status of Norway's envoys to the Palestinian Authority accusing Oslo of \"anti-Israel behaviour\" during the Gaza war and drawing a formal protest.\n\nNorway, a key facilitator in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, particularly in the secret negotiations that led to the Oslo Accords of the 1990s swiftly summoned the Israeli ambassador to lodge a formal protest.\n\nIsraeli foreign minister Israel Katz said he \"ordered the termination of any representation on behalf of the Norwegian embassy in Israel vis-a-vis the Palestinian Authority,\" which has limited powers in urban areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\n\"There is a price for anti-Israel behaviour,\" Katz added in a statement, citing Norway's recent recognition of a Palestinian state and backing of a pending International Criminal Court case implicating Israeli leaders in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\n\nNorway accused the hard-right government of PM Benjamin Netanyahu of adopting an \"extreme\" response.\n\n\"This is an extreme action that first and foremost affects our ability to help the Palestinian population\", foreign minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement.\n\n\"We are considering what measures Norway will take to respond to the situation that the Netanyahu government has now created\", he added.\n\nBarth Eide later called in an Israeli embassy official to hear a formal protest.\n\n\"A short while ago, I summoned Israel's representative to Norway and met her at the foreign ministry to protest against this decision,\" the minister told journalists.\n\n'Baseless pretexts'\n\nThe Palestinian Authority accused Israel of resorting to \"baseless pretexts\" to put pressure on any government that tries to halt \"violations against our people\".\n\nA statement from its foreign ministry expressed \"condemnation and strong disapproval of the decision by the (Israeli) occupation authorities to restrict the work of Norwegian diplomats operating in the occupied State of Palestine, including Jerusalem\".\n\nIt also expressed \"rejection and disapproval of Israel's attempts to create baseless pretexts to pressure countries and international institutions that support our people and contribute to diplomatic and legal pressure on the occupying power to halt its crimes and violations against our people\".\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry said it would revoke the diplomatic status of \"eight Norwegian diplomats... whose duties were to represent Norway vis-a-vis the Palestinian Authority\".\n\nIn an official note delivered Thursday, the ministry said the order would go into effect in seven days.\n\nThe note accused Norway of \"one-sided policies and statements\" since the October 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza.\n\nIn May, Israel had ordered Spain's consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering consular services to Palestinians from the occupied West Bank from June 1, a \"punitive\" measure for Madrid's recognition of a Palestinian state, Katz said at the time.\n\nSpain, Ireland and Norway had earlier announced their decision to recognise a Palestinian state, which Israel's government opposes.\n\nRecognition by the three countries brought to 146 the number of UN member states recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nNorway on August 5 said the International Criminal Court had jurisdiction over Palestinian territories and that it should go ahead with proceedings in its case for arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders over the Gaza war.\n\nIn June, Norway announced it would increase its funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) by 100 million kroner ($9.3 million).\n\nNorway hosted secret Israeli-Palestinian talks in the Norwegian capital that led to the first Oslo Accord signed in Washington in 1993.\n\nThe agreements established a limited degree of Palestinian self-rule, and were intended as an interim measure that would lead to Palestinian statehood, but talks tapered off.\n\nForeign leaders have warned that the expansion of Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law, threatens the viability of a Palestinian state.", "source": {"uri":

diplomats serving the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\n\"There is a price for anti-Israel behaviour,\" said Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Thursday, citing Norway's recognition of Palestinian statehood and its backing of an International Criminal Court (ICC) case implicating Israeli leaders in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity as reasons for the move.\n\nThe Norwegian ambassador was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem on Thursday, where he was informed that the diplomats, all based in Tel Aviv, would have their accreditation revoked in seven days and their visas annulled in three months.\n\n\"This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population,\" said Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide in a statement, warning that the decision would have \"consequences\" for its relationship with the Israeli government.\n\nNorway is still considering its response to the situation.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Thursday that mentioned \"serious statements by senior Norwegian officials\" that were viewed as anti-Israeli.\n\nIn an official note delivered to the Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv, the ministry also accused Norway of \"one-sided policies and statements\" since the October 7 Hamas-led attack in southern Israel that preceded Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSpain, Ireland and Norway announced their decision to recognise a Palestinian state back in May, drawing a strong rebuke from Israel whose leaders have repeatedly spoken out against Palestinian statehood.\n\nIsrael had reacted furiously, accusing all three of \"rewarding terrorism\" and immediately withdrawing its ambassadors to Ireland, Norway and Spain.\n\nIt also ordered Spain's consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering consular services to Palestinians from June 1, with Katz saying at the time that it was a \"punitive\" measure.\n\nIn May, the chief prosecutor of the ICC, Karim Khan, applied for arrest warrants against top Israeli and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes.\n\nKhan announced his office had \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant bore \"criminal responsibility\" for \"war crimes and crimes against humanity\".", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com",

the Palestinian issue,\" Katz said in a statement.\n\nThe decision comes as the Israeli military has ordered another mass evacuation in large areas around Khan Younis in southern Gaza, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian rocket fire.\n\nThis follows Israeli airstrikes on two schools-turned-shelters in Gaza City which killed at least a dozen people, according to the Palestinian emergency response agency.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas \"command and control centres\" hidden within the Zahraa and Abdelfattah Hamouda school compounds in eastern Gaza City.\n\nThe IDF said it had taken \"numerous steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians,\" via precision munitions, surveillance and intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, a Human Rights Watch report claims Israeli soldiers killed at least seven people and severely wounded two when they attacked a home in Gaza City where a Palestinian family was sheltering in December.\n\nThe report was based on interviews with two members of the al-Khalidi family who witnessed the attack, and video footage released by the Israeli military that placed forces in the vicinity of the home at the time.\n\nThe Israeli military has not yet responded to these allegations.\n\nSaudi Arabia has branded the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week a \"flagrant violation\" of international law.\n\nThe statement was issued by the country's Deputy Foreign Minister, Waleed Elkhereiji, following the meeting of the Saudi-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which issued a similar statement the day before.\n\nThe statement did not directly blame Israel but referred to Israeli attacks against Palestinians \"inside and outside the Palestinian territories\".\n\nIran has

Foreign Affairs cancelled on Thursday the travel visas of the Norwegian diplomatic mission operating in the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry sent a letter to the Embassy of Norway in Israel, terminating the mission of its job with the Palestinian Authority, cancelling entry visas for employees of the Norwegian representation in Ramallah within 7 days, and refusing to issue any entry visa for any Norwegian official who will work in the Palestinian territories, indicating that this comes in response to the unilateral measures taken by Norway and its positions after October 7.\n\nThis step was not the first against Norway, as two days ago Israel stopped transferring the Gaza Strip allocations that it deducts from the clearance funds to Norway, in response to the latter's recognition of the State of Palestine, and the statements of its Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide, in which he condemned Israel's policies during the war of extermination on Gaza.\n\nYedioth Ahronoth reported that the Israeli Ministerial Council for Political and Security Affairs (the Cabinet) decided to cancel the Israeli-Norwegian arrangement in response to Norway's decision to recognize the Palestinian state and the legal viewpoint it submitted to the International Criminal Court.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, Israeli government is looking for a new country to transfer the funds it deducts from the clearance funds, which are equal to the amounts allocated by the Palestinian government to the Gaza Strip.\n\nLast May, Norway, Spain and Ireland announced their official recognition of the Palestinian state, followed in June by Slovenia and Armenia.\n\nThese recognitions angered Israel, whose Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, quickly summoned the ambassadors of Madrid, Dublin and Oslo in response to their countries' recognition of the State of Palestine, and also summoned the ambassadors of Tel Aviv from these countries.\n\nIn retaliation against the Palestinians, the occupation government announced the expansion of colonization and the cancellation of the \"Disengagement Law\" in a number of colonies evacuated two decades ago in the northern West Bank.",

I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, 'Could we have done things that would have prevented it?'\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu is Israel's longest-serving prime minister and has long billed himself as a staunch protector of Israel's security. Shortly after the October 7 attack, Mr Netanyahu posted on social media that intelligence services had failed to anticipate the Hamas operation and warn him.\n\nHe deleted and apologised for that post after numerous Israelis accused him of deflecting blame and jeopardising national unity.\n\nThanks for following the Telegraph's live blog. We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates on the conflict.\n\nYemen's Houthis will coordinate with other members of the \"Axis of Resistance\" in any joint operation, the group's leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said on Thursday, using the name that Iran and its regional allies use for groups aligned with Tehran.\n\nHe said any decision to respond to Israeli attacks would be made by the axis as a whole.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in an interview published Thursday that he was \"sorry\" that Hamas was able to carry out its October 7 attack, without explicitly taking responsibility.\n\nMr Netanyahu, who has resisted making an apology for security failures over Israel's worst-ever attack and focused on destroying Hamas, was asked if he would apologize during an interview with Time magazine.\n\n\"Apologize?\" he was quoted as replying.\n\n\"Of course, of course. I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, 'Could we have done things that would have prevented it?'\" he said.\n\nThe leader of Yemen's Houthis said on Thursday that retaliation for an Israeli strike on a port under the control of the Iran-backed rebels was inevitable.\n\nThe response to the July 20 attack that targeted fuel storage tanks in Hodeida harbour is \"inevitable and will come,\" Abdul Malik al-Huthi said in a televised speech, adding that the battle with Israel was \"at its zenith\".\n\nTwelve people were killed in Israeli strikes on two schools in eastern Gaza, the Hamas-run Palestinian civil defence service said on Thursday.\n\nIsrael Katz, the Israeli foreign minister, said on Thursday the diplomatic status of Norwegian envoys to the Palestinian Authority would be revoked over Oslo's \"anti-Israel behaviour\" since the Gaza war began in October.\n\nNorway has long been a facilitator in the Middle East peace process, particularly leading to the 1993 Oslo Accords, and it swifty reacted to Mr Katz's announcement which Oslo said \"will have consequences\".\n\nThe Israeli minister said he \"ordered the termination of any representation on behalf of the Norwegian Embassy in Israel vis-a-vis the Palestinian Authority,\" which has partial administrative power in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\n\"There is a price for anti-Israel behaviour,\" Mr Katz added in a statement, citing Norway's recent recognition of a Palestinian state and backing of a pending International Criminal Court case implicating Israeli leaders in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIsraeli forces stepped up strikes across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing at least 25 people, Palestinian medics claimed, in further battle with Hamas-led militants as Israel braced for potential wider war in the region.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes hit a cluster of houses in central Gaza's Al-Bureij camp, killing at least 15 people, and the nearby Al-Nuseirat camp, killed four, medics said. Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nIsrael committed a costly \"strategic mistake\" with its killing of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader, in Tehran last week, Iran's acting foreign minister told AFP in an interview on Thursday.\n\n\"The act that the Zionists carried out in Tehran was a strategic mistake because it will cost them gravely,\" Ali Bagheri said, and accused Israel of wanting \"to expand tension, war and conflict to other countries\".\n\nItaly's ITA Airways further extended a suspension of its flights to and from Tel Aviv until August 10 \"due to the geopolitical developments in the Middle East and to ensure the safety of its passengers and crews,\" the company said on Thursday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the airline had extended the interruption of its connections with the Israeli capital until Aug 8, from a previous date of Aug 6.\n\nKamala Harris warned anti-Israel hecklers at a Democrat rally they risked handing Donald Trump victory in the presidential election.\n\nThe vice-president was speaking in Detroit on Wednesday night when the pro-Palestinian activists interrupted her.\n\n\"Kamala! Kamala! You can't hide! We won't vote for genocide!\" they chanted.\n\n\"You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking,\" Ms Harris scolded.\n\nBefore shutting down the hecklers, the Democrat presidential nominee said: \"I'm here because we believe in democracy. Everyone's voice matters, but I am speaking now.\"\n\nIsrael has given notice it will no longer accredit Norwegian diplomats serving the occupied Palestinian territories, Norway's foreign ministry said on Thursday, calling it \"an extreme act\" by the Israeli government.\n\nNorway is now considering its response to the situation, Espen Barth Eide, the Norwegian minister of foreign affairs, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population ... Today's decision will have consequences for our relationship with the Netanyahu government,\" he said.\n\nBritain saw almost 2,000 anti-Semitic incidents in the first half of 2024, a record figure for the first six months of any year, a Jewish advisory body said on Thursday.\n\nThe Community Security Trust (CST), which advises Britain's estimated 280,000 Jews on security matters, said more than half of the incidents recorded were related to Israel, Gaza, Hamas or the current conflict in the region.\n\n\"The disgraceful surge in British anti-Semitism is further evidenced by these latest figures,\" said Mark Gardner, the CST chief executive . \"It happens across society, including in schools, campuses, places of work, public transport and on the streets.\"\n\nAir France has extended the suspension of flights between Paris and Beirut until at least Sunday \"due to the security situation\" in Lebanon.\n\n\"The resumption of operations will be subject to a further assessment of the local situation,\" Air France said in a notice on its website posted late on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael Katz, Israel's foreign minister, said on Thursday the diplomatic status of Norwegian envoys to the Palestinian Authority would be revoked over Oslo's \"anti-Israel behaviour\" since the Gaza war began in October.\n\n\"I ordered the termination of any representation on behalf of the Norwegian Embassy in Israel vis-a-vis the Palestinian Authority,\" Mr Katz said in a statement.\n\n\"There is a price for anti-Israel behaviour,\" the top diplomat added, citing Norway's recent recognition of a Palestinian state and backing of a pending International Criminal Court case implicating Israeli leaders in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nA separate statement mentioned \"serious statements by senior Norwegian officials\" that the foreign ministry viewed as anti-Israeli.\n\nA second member of the Democrats' Left-wing \"Squad\" in Congress has been ousted after a $9 million campaign by pro-Israel groups, writes Rozina Sabur, Deputy US Editor.\n\nCori Bush, a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza, lost the Democratic primary for her seat in St Louis, Missouri, to Wesley Bell, a local prosecutor, by 46 per cent to 51 per cent.\n\nThe district is staunchly Democratic and Mr Bell is expected to hold it in November's election.\n\nRead the full piece here.\n\nUS military forces have struck at targets in Houthi-controlled Yemen in the past 24 hours, destroying two drones, a Houthi ground control station, and three anti-ship cruise missiles, the US Central Command (Centcom) said.\n\nEarlier, the Iran-aligned Houthi movement said it had attacked a container ship in the Red Sea and two US destroyers in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday.\n\nCentcom said in a statement on the US strikes: \"These weapons presented a clear and imminent threat to US and coalition forces, and merchant vessels in the region.\"\n\nIt said this \"reckless and dangerous behavior\" by the Houthis threatened regional stability, but it gave no further details and did not confirm that any US vessels had been attacked.\n\nIsrael has vowed to eliminate new Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, the alleged mastermind of the October 7 attack, with regional hostilities threatening to boil over as the Gaza war enters its 11th month.\n\nThe naming of Sinwar to lead the Palestinian militant group came as Israel steeled itself for potential Iranian retaliation over the killing of his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh last week in Tehran.\n\nSpeaking at a military base on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was \"determined\" to defend itself.\n\n\"We are prepared both defensively and offensively,\" he told new recruits.\n\nThe World Central Kitchen (WCK), a US-based, non-governmental organisation, said on Thursday that a Palestinian staff member had been killed in Gaza.\n\nThe WCK identified the person as Nadi Sallout and said it believed he was killed while off duty on Wednesday near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was still seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nThe Canadian government said on Wednesday it has decided to pull the children and guardians of its diplomats out of Israel, amid fears of a widened conflict in the Middle East, the Canadian Press reported.\n\nIsrael's tensions with Iran and Hezbollah have fanned fears of a broader conflict in a region already on edge amid Israel's assault on Gaza which has killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis, including widespread hunger.\n\nThere has been an increased risk of escalation into a broader Middle East war after the killings of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, in Iran, and Fuad Shukr, the Hezbollah military commander, in Beirut, drew threats of retaliation against Israel.\n\nNagasaki's mayor said on Thursday it was \"unfortunate\" that US and British ambassadors have refused to attend a ceremony marking the 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city because Israel was snubbed.\n\nBut he defended the decision not to invite Israel to Friday's annual event, repeating that it was \"not political\" but to avoid possible protests related to the Gaza conflict.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that they have communicated to us that their ambassadors are not able to attend,\" Shiro Suzuki told reporters.\n\n\"We made a comprehensive decision not for political reasons. We want to conduct a smooth ceremony in a peaceful and solemn environment.\"\n\nOn August 9 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, killing 74,000 people including many who survived the explosion but died later from radiation exposure.\n\nBritain and Egypt asked their airlines on Wednesday to avoid Iranian and Lebanese airspace amid growing fears of a possible broader conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThere has been an increased risk of escalation into a broader regional war after the killings last week of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' leader, in Iran and Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's military commander, in Beirut drew threats of retaliation against Israel.\n\nBritain's advisory to its airlines to avoid Lebanon's airspace came hours after Egypt instructed all of its airlines to avoid Iran's airspace for three hours in the early morning on Thursday.\n\nMany airlines globally are revising their schedules to avoid Iranian and Lebanese airspace while also calling off flights to Israel and Lebanon.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type":

Some officials have suggested Hezbollah is progressing in its plans faster than Iran.\n\nTehran has made some of the necessary preparations to launch an attack but is still deciding how it will to respond, an intelligence official told CNN. Iran has been under pressure from US officials to exercise restraint to avoid escalating the conflict in the Levant into a wider regional war.\n\nHassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has vowed that the terror group will retaliate against Israel \"whatever the consequences\", while Israel warned Hezbollah on Thursday that it will pay a \"disproportionate\" price if it harms Israeli civilians.\n\nThanks for following the Telegraph's live blog. We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates on the conflict.\n\nYemen's Houthis will coordinate with other members of the \"Axis of Resistance\" in any joint operation, the group's leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said on Thursday, using the name that Iran and its regional allies use for groups aligned with Tehran.\n\nHe said any decision to respond to Israeli attacks would be made by the axis as a whole.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said in an interview published Thursday that he was \"sorry\" that Hamas was able to carry out its October 7 attack, without explicitly taking responsibility.\n\nMr Netanyahu, who has resisted making an apology for security failures over Israel's worst-ever attack and focused on destroying Hamas, was asked if he would apologize during an interview with Time magazine.\n\n\"Apologize?\" he was quoted as replying.\n\n\"Of course, of course. I am sorry, deeply, that something like this happened. And you always look back and you say, 'Could we have done things that would have prevented it?'\" he said.\n\nThe leader of Yemen's Houthis said on Thursday that retaliation for an Israeli strike on a port under the control of the Iran-backed rebels was inevitable.\n\nThe response to the July 20 attack that targeted fuel storage tanks in Hodeida harbour is \"inevitable and will come,\" Abdul Malik al-Huthi said in a televised speech, adding that the battle with Israel was \"at its zenith\".\n\nTwelve people were killed in Israeli strikes on two schools in eastern Gaza, the Hamas-run Palestinian civil defence service said on Thursday.\n\nIsrael Katz, the Israeli foreign minister, said on Thursday the diplomatic status of Norwegian envoys to the Palestinian Authority would be revoked over Oslo's \"anti-Israel behaviour\" since the Gaza war began in October.\n\nNorway has long been a facilitator in the Middle East peace process, particularly leading to the 1993 Oslo Accords, and it swifty reacted to Mr Katz's announcement which Oslo said \"will have consequences\".\n\nThe Israeli minister said he \"ordered the termination of any representation on behalf of the Norwegian Embassy in Israel vis-a-vis the Palestinian Authority,\" which has partial administrative power in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\n\"There is a price for anti-Israel behaviour,\" Mr Katz added in a statement, citing Norway's recent recognition of a Palestinian state and backing of a pending International Criminal Court case implicating Israeli leaders in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIsraeli forces stepped up strikes across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing at least 25 people, Palestinian medics claimed, in further battle with Hamas-led militants as Israel braced for potential wider war in the region.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes hit a cluster of houses in central Gaza's Al-Bureij camp, killing at least 15 people, and the nearby Al-Nuseirat camp, killed four, medics said. Nuseirat and Bureij are among the densely populated enclave's eight historic camps and seen by Israel as strongholds of armed militants.\n\nIsraeli aircraft also bombed a house in the heart of Gaza City in the north, killing five Palestinians, while another airstrike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed one person and wounded others, according to medics.\n\nIsrael committed a costly \"strategic mistake\" with its killing of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader, in Tehran last week, Iran's acting foreign minister told AFP in an interview on Thursday.\n\n\"The act that the Zionists carried out in Tehran was a strategic mistake because it will cost them gravely,\" Ali Bagheri said, and accused Israel of wanting \"to expand tension, war and conflict to other countries\".\n\nItaly's ITA Airways further extended a suspension of its flights to and from Tel Aviv until August 10 \"due to the geopolitical developments in the Middle East and to ensure the safety of its passengers and crews,\" the company said on Thursday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the airline had extended the interruption of its connections with the Israeli capital until Aug 8, from a previous date of Aug 6.\n\nKamala Harris warned anti-Israel hecklers at a Democrat rally they risked handing Donald Trump victory in the presidential election.\n\nThe vice-president was speaking in Detroit on Wednesday night when the pro-Palestinian activists interrupted her.\n\n\"Kamala! Kamala! You can't hide! We won't vote for genocide!\" they chanted.\n\n\"You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking,\" Ms Harris scolded.\n\nBefore shutting down the hecklers, the Democrat presidential nominee said: \"I'm here because we believe in democracy. Everyone's voice matters, but I am speaking now.\"\n\nIsrael has given notice it will no longer accredit Norwegian diplomats serving the occupied Palestinian territories, Norway's foreign ministry said on Thursday, calling it \"an extreme act\" by the Israeli government.\n\nNorway is now considering its response to the situation, Espen Barth Eide, the Norwegian minister of foreign affairs, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population ... Today's decision will have consequences for our relationship with the Netanyahu government,\" he said.\n\nBritain saw almost 2,000 anti-Semitic incidents in the first half of 2024, a record figure for the first six months of any year, a Jewish advisory body said on Thursday.\n\nThe Community Security Trust (CST), which advises Britain's estimated 280,000 Jews on security matters, said more than half of the incidents recorded were related to Israel, Gaza, Hamas or the current conflict in the region.\n\n\"The disgraceful surge in British anti-Semitism is further evidenced by these latest figures,\" said Mark Gardner, the CST chief executive . \"It happens across society, including in schools, campuses, places of work, public transport and on the streets.\"\n\nAir France has extended the suspension of flights between Paris and Beirut until at least Sunday \"due to the security situation\" in Lebanon.\n\n\"The resumption of operations will be subject to a further assessment of the local situation,\" Air France said in a notice on its website posted late on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael Katz, Israel's foreign minister, said on Thursday the diplomatic status of Norwegian envoys to the Palestinian Authority would be revoked over Oslo's \"anti-Israel behaviour\" since the Gaza war began in October.\n\n\"I ordered the termination of any representation on behalf of the Norwegian Embassy in Israel vis-a-vis the Palestinian Authority,\" Mr Katz said in a statement.\n\n\"There is a price for anti-Israel behaviour,\" the top diplomat added, citing Norway's recent recognition of a Palestinian state and backing of a pending International Criminal Court case implicating Israeli leaders in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nA separate statement mentioned \"serious statements by senior Norwegian officials\" that the foreign ministry viewed as anti-Israeli.\n\nA second member of the Democrats' Left-wing \"Squad\" in Congress has been ousted after a $9 million campaign by pro-Israel groups, writes Rozina Sabur, Deputy US Editor.\n\nCori Bush, a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza, lost the Democratic primary for her seat in St Louis, Missouri, to Wesley Bell, a local prosecutor, by 46 per cent to 51 per cent.\n\nThe district is staunchly Democratic and Mr Bell is expected to hold it in November's election.\n\nRead the full piece here.\n\nUS military forces have struck at targets in Houthi-controlled Yemen in the past 24 hours, destroying two drones, a Houthi ground control station, and three anti-ship cruise missiles, the US Central Command (Centcom) said.\n\nEarlier, the Iran-aligned Houthi movement said it had attacked a container ship in the Red Sea and two US destroyers in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday.\n\nCentcom said in a statement on the US strikes: \"These weapons presented a clear and imminent threat to US and coalition forces, and merchant vessels in the region.\"\n\nIt said this \"reckless and dangerous behavior\" by the Houthis threatened regional stability, but it gave no further details and did not confirm that any US vessels had been attacked.\n\nIsrael has vowed to eliminate new Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, the alleged mastermind of the October 7 attack, with regional hostilities threatening to boil over as the Gaza war enters its 11th month.\n\nThe naming of Sinwar to lead the Palestinian militant group came as Israel steeled itself for potential Iranian retaliation over the killing of his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh last week in Tehran.\n\nSpeaking at a military base on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was \"determined\" to defend itself.\n\n\"We are prepared both defensively and offensively,\" he told new recruits.\n\nThe World Central Kitchen (WCK), a US-based, non-governmental organisation, said on Thursday that a Palestinian staff member had been killed in Gaza.\n\nThe WCK identified the person as Nadi Sallout and said it believed he was killed while off duty on Wednesday near Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. The WCK said it was still seeking further details.\n\nThe Israeli military said it did not know of any such incident, adding it had been in contact with WCK.\n\nThe Canadian government said on Wednesday it has decided to pull the children and guardians of its diplomats out of Israel, amid fears of a widened conflict in the Middle East, the Canadian Press reported.\n\nIsrael's tensions with Iran and Hezbollah have fanned fears of a broader conflict in a region already on edge amid Israel's assault on Gaza which has killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis, including widespread hunger.\n\nThere has been an increased risk of escalation into a broader Middle East war after the killings of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, in Iran, and Fuad Shukr, the Hezbollah military commander, in Beirut, drew threats of retaliation against Israel.\n\nNagasaki's mayor said on Thursday it was \"unfortunate\" that US and British ambassadors have refused to attend a ceremony marking the 1945 atomic bombing of the Japanese city because Israel was snubbed.\n\nBut he defended the decision not to invite Israel to Friday's annual event, repeating that it was \"not political\" but to avoid possible protests related to the Gaza conflict.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that they have communicated to us that their ambassadors are not able to attend,\" Shiro Suzuki told reporters.\n\n\"We made a comprehensive decision not for political reasons. We want to conduct a smooth ceremony in a peaceful and solemn environment.\"\n\nOn August 9 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, killing 74,000 people including many who survived the explosion but died later from radiation exposure.\n\nBritain and Egypt asked their airlines on Wednesday to avoid Iranian and Lebanese airspace amid growing fears of a possible broader conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThere has been an increased risk of escalation into a broader regional war after the killings last week of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' leader, in Iran and Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's military commander, in Beirut drew threats of retaliation against Israel.\n\nBritain's advisory to its airlines to avoid Lebanon's airspace came hours after Egypt instructed all of its airlines to avoid Iran's airspace for three hours in the early morning on Thursday.\n\nMany airlines globally are revising their schedules to avoid Iranian and Lebanese airspace while also calling off flights to Israel and Lebanon.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement",

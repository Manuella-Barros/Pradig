Nancy Pelosi has appeared on two separate seasons of \"All Stars,\" in 2018 and 2022. In both visits, she, too, impressed the power of voting.\n\n\"Drag Race\" has even seen multiple contestants impersonate former President Donald Trump. \"Drag Race UK\" winner The Vivienne ran away with the coveted Snatch Game challenge with her textured impersonation of Trump. And on Season 11, the queens performed \"Trump: The Musical,\" which skewered the former president's family and political allies.\n\nThough the tone of the series leans toward silly and heartfelt, \"Drag Race\" does not shy away from politics. Most episodes of \"Drag Race\" end with the queens on the runway, hoisting signs with phrases like \"You better vote!\" with the vote.gov link, through which users can register to vote. Previous seasons have included faux political debates and nods to policies like \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We are all in this together, and your vote is your power. So please make sure your voice is heard this November, and register to vote.\"\n\nTaped a few weeks before Harris announced her bid for the presidency, Harris joined judge Michelle Visage, Emmy-nominated choreographer Jamal Sims, Lance Bass, Leslie Jones, and Cheyenne Jackson and made her plea, encouraging Americans to register to vote.\n\nShe has long been an advocate for human and civil rights, and a champion for marriage equality. Last month, Harris hosted a Pride month reception in partnership with the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. \"Drag Race\" season 16 winner Nymhpia Wind, \"All Stars\" queens Vanessa Vanjie Mateo, and Plastique Tiara, and Billy Porter were among the guests. On Wednesday night, the Human Rights Campaign backed Harris' White House bid. They said, \"In the Senate and as Vice President, Kamala Harris has been a champion for the Equality Act, which would ensure comprehensive non-discrimination protections for the LGBTQ+ community, and the Respect for Marriage Act, which secured federal marriage protections.\"\n\nThis is not the first time a politician has appeared on the show. Back in 2020, Congresswoman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on the judges panel, and in 2022, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared on \"All Stars\" season 7 and encouraged Americans to vote.\n\n\"Drag Race\" has also long advocated for voting rights. Each week queens and the show's host RuPaul end the show by reminding audiences to register to vote.\n\nPart two of the grand finale is expected to be a \"Variety Extravaganza\" as all eight queens return, with the winning queen earning $200,000 which will be donated to their chosen charity. Three Benefactress badges are also up for grabs, and a new voting twist could change everything.\n\nLast week, RuPaul reminded the queens that the three queens with the most badges will be vying for the crown. But he swiftly added any of the queens could snatch the crown and be inducted into the Drag Race Hall of Fame. As of the grand finale part 1, Roxxxy Andrews had five Benefactress badges, Jorgeous and Plastique Tiara were tied with four with the former having a slight edge by having a lip-sync tie and maxi challenge win.\n\nTune in to see who is crowned Queen of All-Stars season nine, and watch the clip below.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [],

Her message will appear in Friday's finale, which airs on Paramount+.\n\n\"Each day we are seeing our rights and freedoms under attack, including the right of everyone to be who they are, love who they love, openly and with pride,\" she said in the clip, flanked by a crew that included former *NSYNC member Lance Bass, \"Saturday Night Live\" alumnus Leslie Jones and \"Drag Race\" judge Michelle Visage. (RuPaul was absent from the clip.)\n\n\"So as we fight back against these attacks, let's all remember -- no one is alone,\" said Harris. \"We are all in this together. And your vote is your power.\"\n\nHarris ended her message by encouraging viewers to register to vote and clapping along to RuPaul's optimistic anthem \"A Little Bit of Love.\"\n\nHarris is one of several prominent Democrats to stop by \"Drag Race.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined the judging panel for a pivotal episode of Season 12. In a tasteful sequin dress, Ocasio-Cortez visited the queens backstage and confessed that before she was a member of Congress, she was a regular \"Drag Race\" viewer.\n\n\"People think Congress and government is all about leading people, but ultimately a lot of our politics is about following the public will,\" she told the rapt group of queens. \"And the people who change what people think are artists and drag queens.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi has appeared on two separate seasons of \"All Stars,\" in 2018 and 2022. In both visits, she, too, impressed the power of voting.\n\n\"Drag Race\" has even seen multiple contestants impersonate former President Donald Trump. \"Drag Race UK\" winner The Vivienne ran away with the coveted Snatch Game challenge with her textured impersonation of Trump. And on Season 11, the queens performed \"Trump: The Musical,\" which skewered the former president's family and political allies.\n\nThough the tone of the series leans toward silly and heartfelt, \"Drag Race\" does not shy away from politics. Most episodes of \"Drag Race\" end with the queens on the runway, hoisting signs with phrases like \"You better vote!\" with the vote.gov link, through which users can register to vote. Previous seasons have included faux political debates and nods to policies like \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

We are all in this together and your vote is your power.\"\n\nDeadline reports the clip will be shown Friday as \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" will air its season 9 finale.\n\nIn typical Harris fashion, her appearance in the clip is hard to watch in that she seems painfully out of place while mashing together all the buzzwords that make vague allusions to how horrible Trump and conservatives are.\n\nThe clip is almost as uncomfortable as her appearance for the 2024 BET awards, but no moment is more unwatchable than her appearance on \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" from March.\n\nWhile it's easy to give a quick eyeroll and voice disapproval, consider the deeper ramifications for Harris with recent news in mind.\n\nPrior to Biden's announcement and her own concerning the party's nomination, she was only the vice president. This was the Biden-Harris Campaign. For Democrats, his name appeared to be the stabilizing force in the duo.\n\nFor whatever Biden's long political career is worth, he served in a similar role as vice president to President Barack Obama for the voter who may have been apprehensive about the latter's candidacy.\n\nBiden is no longer in the equation. Harris must stand on her own.\n\nRegular people with a shred of decency do not want their candidate to make appearances on TV shows about drag.\n\nBy continuing to court the far left, Harris is fixing to learn in November that they represent a tiny fraction of the American voter.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_short@westernjournal.com", "name": "Samuel Short", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RuPaul's Drag Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Visage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Visage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drew_Barrymore_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Drew Barrymore Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/harris-2-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763862", "eventUri": "eng-9763862", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

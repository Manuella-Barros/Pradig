Boyd would have ranked second with 67 catches for 667 yards and two TDs.\n\nLevis, the 33rd pick overall a year ago, said it's on him to instill confidence in his teammates. He sees the Titans\u00b4 new additions helping improve the offense with competition pushing everyone to be better.\n\n\"It\u00b4s going to be great for all of us and just great to have that environment of competitiveness, and everyone\u00b4s going to get better because of it,\" Levis said.\n\nCallahan said Levis has been working to learn everything his new coaches are teaching him, including technique and fundamentals. He likes how Levis has attacked this offseason.\n\n\"He\u00b4s really gotten better in a short amount of time because of the way he approaches his job, and that\u00b4s all you can ask for at this point of year,\" Callahan said.\n\nLevis has been working with a new quarterbacks coach in Bo Hardegree, a Tennessee native. Levis said he's already texted Boyd, letting him know how eager he is to have the receiver as a resource in learning Callahan's offense. Levis already has watched tape of Boyd making plays with Cincinnati.\n\nLevis has been throwing with Ridley, enough to feel they can develop a special chemistry.\n\n\"He's been great and looking forward to get TB here,\" Levis said.\n\nLevis went 3-6 once he replaced veteran Ryan Tannehill at the end of October. Hopkins caught his first three TD catches from Levis in a strong debut win over Atlanta. Levis finished the season 149 of 255 for 1,808 yards with eight TDs and four interceptions.\n\n\"A veteran receiver who knows where he\u00b4s going is the quarterback\u00b4s best friend,\" new receivers coach Tyke Tolbert said.\n\nLevis and Tennessee certainly can use the help. The Titans ranked 29th last season, averaging a mere 180.4 yards passing a game. Cincinnati ranked 15th with 229.1 yards despite quarterback Joe Burrow limited to 10 games by a season-ending wrist injury.\n\nAsked to describe the Titans' new offense after years of being a run-oriented offense with four-time Pro Bowl back Derrick Henry now in Baltimore, Levis said balanced. Callahan has made clear to the quarterback he will be throwing more, and Levis said he has to earn his coach's trust.\n\n\"That was cool to hear that,\" Levis said.\n\nAP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\n\nFILE - Tennessee Titans quarterback Will Levis (8) throws to a receiver during warmups before an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers Sunday, Nov. 26, 2023, in Nashville, Tenn.

Around this time last year, the former Kentucky quarterback answered questions about falling on draft night and the chip on his shoulder going into rookie camp as a second-round selection. A year later, Levis's offseason responsibilities are very different after he took the starting quarterback job in Nashville, moving from QB3 to QB1 in his rookie season.\n\nToday, Levis was the only Titans player at Thursday's press conference in Nashville, proving his status within the locker room ahead of his first full season with the keys to the car. Levis joined first-year head coach Brian Callahan and the team's assistant coaches to recap the spring and preview the summer before rookie camp begins for the new class on Friday.\n\nLevis addressed several interesting topics to Titans fans, some of which you will find summarized below. However, the collective KSR readership will be more interested in the shirt Levis wore to speak on behalf of his NFL franchise. The Titans starting QB didn't use Thursday's face time at the podium to show off the latest release from the team store or the newest trend in Nashville fashion. Instead, Levis wore a Kentucky basketball t-shirt for the cameras in Tennessee.\n\nAll of those Tennessee Vols within the Titans fan base can't love their guy being so proud of his Big Blue roots. Levis also wore a Kentucky hat before the team's final road game at Houston last season:\n\nFor those wondering, Levis' hat and shirt are from a '47 Brand release last year. I shouldn't know that, but I do.\n\nMore than a shirt, Kentucky also earned a mention in Levis' Thursday comments about the Titans. Speaking about Brian Callahan's new offense, Levis compared the new language to how he and Liam Coen communicated UK's offense during Levis' first season in Lexington.\n\nWhen asked about the familiarity of Callahan's offense, Levis replied, \"Actually, language-wise, it's most similar, I think, to my first year at Kentucky, so that was kind of cool hearing that new verbiage come back to me.\"\n\nThat makes sense because Coen came up in the Sean McVay system with Zac Taylor, who would go on to hire Brian Callahan to be his first offensive coordinator with the Bengals from 2019 through last season.\n\nLevis loved the hiring of Callahan in Tennessee back in January. \"I was psyched when we got the news about him,\" he admitted Thursday. \"Starting to learn about him and the quarterbacks and offenses he's worked with in the past got me really excited, and it's been great to work with him.\"\n\nLevis also revealed that Callahan told him in their first meeting, \"Hey, we're going to throw the ball. We're going to throw the ball on first down. We're going to throw in all types of situations. It's going to be on you and we're going to trust you to do it.\"\n\nOf course, those are exciting words for a QB to hear, and Levis can't wait for the opportunity this fall. Last season, he played in only nine games, attempting fewer than 30 passes per game. Tennessee ranked last in the entire league in that category and others.\n\nThe coaching change will benefit Levis, as will the Titans' spending in free agency to add offensive weapons and prioritizing a left tackle with the first pick in the draft. Former Jacksonville receiver Calvin Ridley was added to the receiver room via free agency signing, and JC Latham, the seventh overall pick in the draft, is expected to solve the problem at left tackle.\n\n\"I love it,\" Levis said of the organization's commitment to build around him. \"It means that you know they're not afraid to make those investments and they want to go win, which is awesome to see.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "drew_franklin@on3.com", "name": "Drew Franklin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Levis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Levis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Coen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liam Coen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Volunteers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zac Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/09135156/will-levis-kentucky-shirt.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555014", "eventUri": "eng-9555014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Levis started his rookie season as the No. 3 QB behind Ryan Tannehill and Malik Willis. Offseason free-agent additions and the NFL Draft show the Titans believe Levis is the future of the franchise.\n\nWhether Will Levis ultimately succeeds or fails as quarterback of the Tennessee Titans, one thing he won't be able to say is that his team didn't put him in a position to succeed.\n\nThe Titans have built an offensive arsenal around Levis, the No. 33 overall pick in 2023, via free agency and the draft since the end of the 2023 regular season. Now, it's on Levis to make it work with a new head coach, Brian Callahan, who was hired to replace Mike Vrabel.\n\nWill the former Kentucky star be the next Josh Allen or the next Carson Wentz? Only time will tell (from USA Today):\n\nThat's all a very big bet on a player who lacked the pre-draft raves Allen did. But you can argue he's slightly ahead of where the former Wyoming star was at the same point in his career. Levis craves action and runs face-first into danger like the Bills quarterback.\n\nWhatever happens in 2024, this will likely be a make-it or break-it year for Levis, and patience is in short supply in the NFL.\n\nRelated Evaluating the Tennessee Titans' Questionable Offseason Approach The Titans may have over-committed to next season with a barrage of free agency signings. The roster might be improved, but were the moves worthwhile? Will Levis Gets Keys to Franchise in Tennessee Kentucky QB experienced one of the most infamous draft-day drops of all time\n\nBefore 2023, NFL fans had a collective memory of what a precipitous draft day fall looked like with Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers getting increasingly more uncomfortable in the green room at the 2005 NFL Draft as he free-fell through the first round until the Green Bay Packers mercifully selected him with the No. 24 overall pick.\n\nThat was, until Levis came along. In a draft that saw a lot of QB-needy teams picking high, Levis was projected to go as high as No. 2 overall to the Houston Texans -- and America got to watch him sit in the green room with his mom, sister, and then-girlfriend as he fell completely out of the first round.\n\nTennessee Titans: Last 10 First-Round PIcks\n\nPlayer\n\nYear (Overall)\n\nJC Latham, OT, Alabama\n\n2024 (7)\n\nPeter Skoronski, OG, Northwestern\n\n2023 (11)\n\nTreylon Burks, WR, Arkansas\n\n2022 (18)\n\nCaleb Farley, CB, Virginia Tech\n\n2021 (22)\n\nIsaiah Wilson, OT, Georgia\n\n2020 (29)\n\nJeffery Simmons, DT, Mississippi State\n\n2019 (19)\n\nRashaan Evans, LB, Alabama\n\n2018 (22)\n\nCorey Davis, WR, Western Michigan\n\n2017 (5)\n\nAdoree Jackson, CB, USC\n\n2017 (18)\n\nJack Conklin, OT, Michigan State\n\n2016 (8)\n\nThe Titans ended Levis' nightmare when they selected him with the first pick of the second round. It's worth pointing out that the damage may have been done by Levis himself before the draft, thanks to a series of bizarre interviews in which he said he ate bananas without peeling them and mixed mayonnaise in his coffee. He later said that wasn't true, which may have been even weirder.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Levis started the season with the Titans as their third-string quarterback behind Ryan Tannehill and Malik Willis, the Titans' third-round pick in 2022.\n\nWritten off by a good chunk of the football world at that point, Levis became the Titans' starter in Week 8 after an ankle injury to Tannehill, and threw for 238 yards and four touchdowns in a 28-24 win over the Atlanta Falcons, after which Vrabel named Levis as the starter moving forward.\n\nPlaying behind a patchwork offensive line, Levis had another notable win on December 11, 2023, against the Miami Dolphins, rallying the Titans from a 14-point deficit with 2:49 remaining for a 28-27 win in which he threw for 327 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.\n\nLevis finished the season with a 3-6 record in nine starts, putting up 1,808 passing yards, eight touchdowns and four interceptions while being sacked a jarring 28 times in just nine games.\n\nTitans Filled Up Roster With Talent to Surround Levis Calvin Ridley's $92 million contract highlights Titans' offseason moves\n\nIf you want evidence the Titans are trying to make sure Levis has a legitimate chance to succeed in the NFL, just look at three players the franchise added on the offensive side of the ball in the offseason.\n\nThe team spent big in free agency, landing wide receiver Calvin Ridley (four years, $92 million), running back Tony Pollard (three years, $24 million), and center Lloyd Cushenberry (four years, $50 million).\n\nRidley is the biggest wild card of the bunch and received $50 million guaranteed in his contract. After a career-high 1,374 receiving yards with the Atlanta Falcons in 2020, he played just five games across the next two seasons due to injury and a yearlong suspension in 2022 for violating the league's gambling policy -- a misstep that cost him $11.2 million in salary.\n\nRidley returned in 2023 with 1,016 receiving yards and 8 touchdowns with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2024, he will be paired with DeAndre Hopkins to provide Levis with two legitimate Pro Bowl talents to target. The Titans added even more experience to the wide receiver group when they signed veteran Tyler Boyd to a one-year, $4.5 million contract on May 7.\n\nThe Titans were also thinking about Levis when it came to the 2024 NFL Draft, where they selected 6-foot-6, 342-pound Alabama offensive tackle JC Latham with the No. 7 overall pick. Latham graded out at over 80 percent in pass protection over his last two college seasons and will play next to 2023 first-round pick and left guard Peter Skoronski.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: The Titans were burned by a pair of quarterbacks taken in the first round in the early 2010s that became all-time busts. Tennessee selected Washington QB Jake Locker with the No. 8 overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft and four years later selected Oregon's Marcus Mariota with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.\n\nEven with that talent infusion, oddsmakers in Las Vegas have little faith Tennessee can pull off a turnaround with Levis at the wheel. FanDuel has set the Titans' over/under win total at 6.5 for 2024.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.

They replaced Derrick Henry with Tony Pollard and orchestrated a deal to bring All-Pro caliber cornerback L'Jarius Sneed and Chidobe Awuzie to fix a lagging secondary. A pair of top 40 draft picks solidified both sides of the line in offensive tackle JC Latham and defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat.\n\nThere's no doubt general manager Ran Carthon has transmogrified his roster in an effort to separate these Titans from the run-heavy throwback squads that defined deposed head coach Mike Vrabel's success. But none of those changes will matter if Tennessee can't put a franchise quarterback in the middle of it.\n\nAnd Will Levis, in a small sample size, hasn't been that guy.\n\nLevis was exactly the kind of high variance passer you'd expect from a rookie second round quarterback. Stuck on a six-win team with some of the NFL's worst pass blocking, he put in work to lead the Titans through tough situations.\n\nThis included a steady diet of \"aw hell, DeAndre Hopkins is down there somewhere\" throws. His 10.6 air yards per throw were the deepest average distance in the league by more than a yard and a half. Baker Mayfield led the NFL with 73 deep passes (20-plus yards downfield) in 2024. Levis averaged 1.5 more deep throws per game than him -- and completed as many of these deep throws (21) in nine weeks as Mayfield did in 17.\n\nThis led to some highlight reel moments, including a four-touchdown day in his NFL debut (Marcus Mariota did it first). It also led to a league-worst 58.4 percent completion rate, more than three sacks per game and a 3-6 record as a starting quarterback.\n\nHis -3.2 percent completion rate over expected, per NFL's Next Gen Stats, was only fourth-worst in the league but ahead of only guys like Taylor Heinicke, Trevor Siemian and Tommy DeVito. Despite his preference for big throws, his average completion only made it either 6.7 yards downfield (per Next Gen Stats) or 7.1 (per Pro Football Reference).\n\nCarthon is betting an upgraded supporting cast can unlock the inner Josh Allen within the former Kentucky star, just like Buffalo did with its mercurial, big-armed, low-accuracy QB. Latham has the talent to protect his blindside. Hopkins, Ridley and Boyd make up a trustworthy top wideout trio, creating valuable insurance if former first round pick Treylon Burks continues to struggle. If those guys can create space, tight end Chigoziem Okonkwo can exploit it with his high level athleticism and run-after-catch prowess.\n\nThat's all a very big bet on a player who lacked the pre-draft raves Allen did. But you can argue he's slightly ahead of where the former Wyoming star was at the same point in his career. Levis craves action and runs face first into danger like the Bills quarterback:\n\nHe also put up numbers that correspond more closely to Allen's second second in the pros -- a year in which he made it to the playoffs -- than his rookie year:\n\nAllen made life easier on himself by staying on schedule more often and creating manageable third downs and showed up in the clutch, as shown by his four fourth quarter comebacks and five game winning drives. But the rest of the stats suggest Levis could be on the same trajectory. In 2020, the Bills acquired Stefon Diggs, ran to the top of the AFC East and had a bonafide MVP candidate behind center.\n\nThat's the plan for Levis, but it discounts the fact Allen is one of one. Not only was he a higher regarded draft prospect, but he walked a tightrope between traits and development few have ever walked. There's a reason all those \"Josh Allen apology forms\" were trending on Twitter in 2020 and 2021. Conventional wisdom suggested he wouldn't work out, until he did.\n\nAsking Levis to do the same is unfair. It's also the only bet Carthon could make. Drafting at seventh overall meant being locked out of the top tier of this year's quarterbacks. While J.J. McCarthy, Michael Penix Jr. and Bo Nix were each available, there's no guarantee any would be better than Levis. Rather than burn a premium pick on another quarterback with borderline credentials -- after drafting Levis in the second round in 2023 and Malik Willis in the third in 2022 -- Tennessee shifted to another need that can provide massive value in Latham.\n\nUpgrading the roster props up Levis, but also creates the reality where the Titans will once again be locked out of the top draft slots even if he fails. That's fine, since 2025 is expected to be a weak year for quarterbacks anyway. There might be some big name free agents available -- notably Dak Prescott, Jared Goff and Tua Tagovailoa -- or those guys could all agree to extensions and never sniff the open market.\n\nThus, Levis's long odds became arguably Tennessee's best bet. There's a roapmap to success here, even if that road is filled with wrecks and the bulk of it has been reclaimed by the jungle growing around it. There's an evolving ecosystem of NFL quarterbacks that made the Titans' Ryan Tannehill era untenable while locking the team out of the other proven ways to land a star.\n\nCarthon's moves and his team's busy offseason may be the equivalent of putting rims and a spoiler on a Mercury Tracer. Or they could be exactly what Levis needs to rise up to speed. The Titans didn't have much other choice in the matter but to be swallowed whole by complacency. Even if the Levis experiment fails, it's a worthy one.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_d_andrea@ftw.usatoday.com",

The team's 2022 first-round NFL Draft pick, Treylon Burks, is also hoping to bounce back from an injury-hit second season.\n\nBoyd's move to Tennessee marks a reunion with the Titans' new coach Brian Callahan, who worked with the 29-year-old at the Cincinnati Bengals as their offensive coordinator since 2019. Levis expressed his excitement about Boyd joining the team, tweeting \"C'mon then let's work! @boutdat_23 [Boyd's social media handle].\"\n\nCallahan has big plans for the Titans' wide receivers, including Burks, emphasizing the need for a standout slot receiver. \"We have to have someone emerge for us at the slot position receiver, when we're in 11 personnel,\" he explained. \"You need depth at every position. Guys that are fast, explosive, and physical, you can't have enough of them.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce accused of 'always being drunk' as concern raised\n\nREAD MORE: Comedian who roasted Tom Brady 'didn't know we could go there' with Kim Kardashian joke\n\nNick Holz, the offensive coordinator, also weighed in on Burks: \"He's a first-round pick, obviously you can see all of the talent. But he's going to get what he earns.\"\n\nIn his debut season, Levis had to bide his time on the bench until he got his break in the October 29 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, where he threw four touchdown passes. In his nine NFL games, Levis racked up 1,808 yards and touchdowns. He also scored a rushing touchdown but tossed four interceptions.\n\nCallahan has already set out his expectations for his quarterback in 2024. \"I want Will to be him,\" Callahan said. \"He's got to do it in his own way. You can't force people to act outside of their character or it doesn't come across as genuine.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nFree agent Tyler Boyd is set to sign for the Titans as Tennessee's rebuild continues\n\n\"I think Will does a really good job of staying true to who he is. I need Will to just be the best version of himself and he's got a role to play as the leader of the offense and the leader of the football team. And I think he gets that.\"\n\nHe continued: \"You have that part, you've got a chance to do a lot of really cool things. But I've seen that from him in this early stage.

Levis started his rookie season as the No. 3 QB behind Ryan Tannehill and Malik Willis. Offseason free-agent additions and the NFL Draft show the Titans believe Levis is the future of the franchise.\n\nWhether Will Levis ultimately succeeds or fails as quarterback of the Tennessee Titans, one thing he won't be able to say is that his team didn't put him in a position to succeed.\n\nThe Titans have built an offensive arsenal around Levis, the No. 33 overall pick in 2023, via free agency and the draft since the end of the 2023 regular season. Now, it's on Levis to make it work with a new head coach, Brian Callahan, who was hired to replace Mike Vrabel.\n\nWill the former Kentucky star be the next Josh Allen or the next Carson Wentz? Only time will tell (from USA Today):\n\nThat's all a very big bet on a player who lacked the pre-draft raves Allen did. But you can argue he's slightly ahead of where the former Wyoming star was at the same point in his career. Levis craves action and runs face-first into danger like the Bills quarterback.\n\nWhatever happens in 2024, this will likely be a make-it or break-it year for Levis, and patience is in short supply in the NFL.\n\nRelated Evaluating the Tennessee Titans' Questionable Offseason Approach The Titans may have over-committed to next season with a barrage of free agency signings. The roster might be improved, but were the moves worthwhile? Will Levis Gets Keys to Franchise in Tennessee Kentucky QB experienced one of the most infamous draft-day drops of all time\n\nBefore 2023, NFL fans had a collective memory of what a precipitous draft day fall looked like with Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers getting increasingly more uncomfortable in the green room at the 2005 NFL Draft as he free-fell through the first round until the Green Bay Packers mercifully selected him with the No. 24 overall pick.\n\nThat was, until Levis came along. In a draft that saw a lot of QB-needy teams picking high, Levis was projected to go as high as No. 2 overall to the Houston Texans -- and America got to watch him sit in the green room with his mom, sister, and then-girlfriend as he fell completely out of the first round.\n\nTennessee Titans: Last 10 First-Round PIcks\n\nPlayer\n\nYear (Overall)\n\nJC Latham, OT, Alabama\n\n2024 (7)\n\nPeter Skoronski, OG, Northwestern\n\n2023 (11)\n\nTreylon Burks, WR, Arkansas\n\n2022 (18)\n\nCaleb Farley, CB, Virginia Tech\n\n2021 (22)\n\nIsaiah Wilson, OT, Georgia\n\n2020 (29)\n\nJeffery Simmons, DT, Mississippi State\n\n2019 (19)\n\nRashaan Evans, LB, Alabama\n\n2018 (22)\n\nCorey Davis, WR, Western Michigan\n\n2017 (5)\n\nAdoree Jackson, CB, USC\n\n2017 (18)\n\nJack Conklin, OT, Michigan State\n\n2016 (8)\n\nThe Titans ended Levis' nightmare when they selected him with the first pick of the second round. It's worth pointing out that the damage may have been done by Levis himself before the draft, thanks to a series of bizarre interviews in which he said he ate bananas without peeling them and mixed mayonnaise in his coffee. He later said that wasn't true, which may have been even weirder.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Levis started the season with the Titans as their third-string quarterback behind Ryan Tannehill and Malik Willis, the Titans' third-round pick in 2022.\n\nWritten off by a good chunk of the football world at that point, Levis became the Titans' starter in Week 8 after an ankle injury to Tannehill, and threw for 238 yards and four touchdowns in a 28-24 win over the Atlanta Falcons, after which Vrabel named Levis as the starter moving forward.\n\nPlaying behind a patchwork offensive line, Levis had another notable win on December 11, 2023, against the Miami Dolphins, rallying the Titans from a 14-point deficit with 2:49 remaining for a 28-27 win in which he threw for 327 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.\n\nLevis finished the season with a 3-6 record in nine starts, putting up 1,808 passing yards, eight touchdowns and four interceptions while being sacked a jarring 28 times in just nine games.\n\nTitans Filled Up Roster With Talent to Surround Levis Calvin Ridley's $92 million contract highlights Titans' offseason moves\n\nIf you want evidence the Titans are trying to make sure Levis has a legitimate chance to succeed in the NFL, just look at three players the franchise added on the offensive side of the ball in the offseason.\n\nThe team spent big in free agency, landing wide receiver Calvin Ridley (four years, $92 million), running back Tony Pollard (three years, $24 million), and center Lloyd Cushenberry (four years, $50 million).\n\nRidley is the biggest wild card of the bunch and received $50 million guaranteed in his contract. After a career-high 1,374 receiving yards with the Atlanta Falcons in 2020, he played just five games across the next two seasons due to injury and a yearlong suspension in 2022 for violating the league's gambling policy -- a misstep that cost him $11.2 million in salary.\n\nRidley returned in 2023 with 1,016 receiving yards and 8 touchdowns with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2024, he will be paired with DeAndre Hopkins to provide Levis with two legitimate Pro Bowl talents to target. The Titans added even more experience to the wide receiver group when they signed veteran Tyler Boyd to a one-year, $4.5 million contract on May 7.\n\nThe Titans were also thinking about Levis when it came to the 2024 NFL Draft, where they selected 6-foot-6, 342-pound Alabama offensive tackle JC Latham with the No. 7 overall pick. Latham graded out at over 80 percent in pass protection over his last two college seasons and will play next to 2023 first-round pick and left guard Peter Skoronski.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: The Titans were burned by a pair of quarterbacks taken in the first round in the early 2010s that became all-time busts. Tennessee selected Washington QB Jake Locker with the No. 8 overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft and four years later selected Oregon's Marcus Mariota with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.\n\nEven with that talent infusion, oddsmakers in Las Vegas have little faith Tennessee can pull off a turnaround with Levis at the wheel. FanDuel has set the Titans' over/under win total at 6.5 for 2024.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.

Levis started his rookie season as the No. 3 QB behind Ryan Tannehill and Malik Willis. Offseason free-agent additions and the NFL Draft show the Titans believe Levis is the future of the franchise.\n\nWhether Will Levis ultimately succeeds or fails as quarterback of the Tennessee Titans, one thing he won't be able to say is that his team didn't put him in a position to succeed.\n\nThe Titans have built an offensive arsenal around Levis, the No. 33 overall pick in 2023, via free agency and the draft since the end of the 2023 regular season. Now, it's on Levis to make it work with a new head coach, Brian Callahan, who was hired to replace Mike Vrabel.\n\nWill the former Kentucky star be the next Josh Allen or the next Carson Wentz? Only time will tell (from USA Today):\n\nThat's all a very big bet on a player who lacked the pre-draft raves Allen did. But you can argue he's slightly ahead of where the former Wyoming star was at the same point in his career. Levis craves action and runs face-first into danger like the Bills quarterback.\n\nWhatever happens in 2024, this will likely be a make-it or break-it year for Levis, and patience is in short supply in the NFL.\n\nRelated Evaluating the Tennessee Titans' Questionable Offseason Approach The Titans may have over-committed to next season with a barrage of free agency signings. The roster might be improved, but were the moves worthwhile? Will Levis Gets Keys to Franchise in Tennessee Kentucky QB experienced one of the most infamous draft-day drops of all time\n\nBefore 2023, NFL fans had a collective memory of what a precipitous draft day fall looked like with Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers getting increasingly more uncomfortable in the green room at the 2005 NFL Draft as he free-fell through the first round until the Green Bay Packers mercifully selected him with the No. 24 overall pick.\n\nThat was, until Levis came along. In a draft that saw a lot of QB-needy teams picking high, Levis was projected to go as high as No. 2 overall to the Houston Texans -- and America got to watch him sit in the green room with his mom, sister, and then-girlfriend as he fell completely out of the first round.\n\nTennessee Titans: Last 10 First-Round PIcks\n\nPlayer\n\nYear (Overall)\n\nJC Latham, OT, Alabama\n\n2024 (7)\n\nPeter Skoronski, OG, Northwestern\n\n2023 (11)\n\nTreylon Burks, WR, Arkansas\n\n2022 (18)\n\nCaleb Farley, CB, Virginia Tech\n\n2021 (22)\n\nIsaiah Wilson, OT, Georgia\n\n2020 (29)\n\nJeffery Simmons, DT, Mississippi State\n\n2019 (19)\n\nRashaan Evans, LB, Alabama\n\n2018 (22)\n\nCorey Davis, WR, Western Michigan\n\n2017 (5)\n\nAdoree Jackson, CB, USC\n\n2017 (18)\n\nJack Conklin, OT, Michigan State\n\n2016 (8)\n\nThe Titans ended Levis' nightmare when they selected him with the first pick of the second round. It's worth pointing out that the damage may have been done by Levis himself before the draft, thanks to a series of bizarre interviews in which he said he ate bananas without peeling them and mixed mayonnaise in his coffee. He later said that wasn't true, which may have been even weirder.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Levis started the season with the Titans as their third-string quarterback behind Ryan Tannehill and Malik Willis, the Titans' third-round pick in 2022.\n\nWritten off by a good chunk of the football world at that point, Levis became the Titans' starter in Week 8 after an ankle injury to Tannehill, and threw for 238 yards and four touchdowns in a 28-24 win over the Atlanta Falcons, after which Vrabel named Levis as the starter moving forward.\n\nPlaying behind a patchwork offensive line, Levis had another notable win on December 11, 2023, against the Miami Dolphins, rallying the Titans from a 14-point deficit with 2:49 remaining for a 28-27 win in which he threw for 327 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.\n\nLevis finished the season with a 3-6 record in nine starts, putting up 1,808 passing yards, eight touchdowns and four interceptions while being sacked a jarring 28 times in just nine games.\n\nTitans Filled Up Roster With Talent to Surround Levis Calvin Ridley's $92 million contract highlights Titans' offseason moves\n\nIf you want evidence the Titans are trying to make sure Levis has a legitimate chance to succeed in the NFL, just look at three players the franchise added on the offensive side of the ball in the offseason.\n\nThe team spent big in free agency, landing wide receiver Calvin Ridley (four years, $92 million), running back Tony Pollard (three years, $24 million), and center Lloyd Cushenberry (four years, $50 million).\n\nRidley is the biggest wild card of the bunch and received $50 million guaranteed in his contract. After a career-high 1,374 receiving yards with the Atlanta Falcons in 2020, he played just five games across the next two seasons due to injury and a yearlong suspension in 2022 for violating the league's gambling policy -- a misstep that cost him $11.2 million in salary.\n\nRidley returned in 2023 with 1,016 receiving yards and 8 touchdowns with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2024, he will be paired with DeAndre Hopkins to provide Levis with two legitimate Pro Bowl talents to target. The Titans added even more experience to the wide receiver group when they signed veteran Tyler Boyd to a one-year, $4.5 million contract on May 7.\n\nThe Titans were also thinking about Levis when it came to the 2024 NFL Draft, where they selected 6-foot-6, 342-pound Alabama offensive tackle JC Latham with the No. 7 overall pick. Latham graded out at over 80 percent in pass protection over his last two college seasons and will play next to 2023 first-round pick and left guard Peter Skoronski.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: The Titans were burned by a pair of quarterbacks taken in the first round in the early 2010s that became all-time busts. Tennessee selected Washington QB Jake Locker with the No. 8 overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft and four years later selected Oregon's Marcus Mariota with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.\n\nEven with that talent infusion, oddsmakers in Las Vegas have little faith Tennessee can pull off a turnaround with Levis at the wheel. FanDuel has set the Titans' over/under win total at 6.5 for 2024.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.

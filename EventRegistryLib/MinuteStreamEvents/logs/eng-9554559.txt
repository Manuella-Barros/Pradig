gang violence in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, have access to safe drinking water thanks to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and partners.\n\nPort-au-Prince has been in the grip of armed groups for several years now, and roughly two months ago they launched coordinated attacks which paralyzed the metropolitan area.\n\nSince then, UNICEF, alongside the National Directorate for Water and Sanitation (DINEPA) and partners, has provided more than 2.6 million litres of safe drinking water to children and families across 20 sites housing those displaced.\n\nThe recent escalation of violence has compounded the already dire situation faced by children and families, who already lack essential support and facilities.\n\nThe current rainy season has only added to their plight, leading to major flooding in lowland areas of the capital and the resurgence of cholera cases in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, an extremely impoverished neighbourhood.\n\n\"With no drinking quality water and adequate sanitation and hygiene facilities, displaced children are exposed to water-borne diseases, more specifically to a widespread cholera outbreak\" said Ruben Um Bayiha, Chief of UNICEF's Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Programme.\n\nFurthermore, he said \"operating in such an insecure and volatile environment is akin to navigating a war zone every day.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, UNICEF and partners are stepping up efforts to protect children and families and provide the lifesaving support they desperately need, he stressed.\n\nUNICEF leads WASH response in Haiti, providing over half of overall support, ensuring safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services at all displacement sites.\n\nInitiatives include trucking water, treating piped water, repairing water supply and sanitation systems, building temporary latrines, providing essential hygiene items, and delivering hygiene messages.\n\nUNICEF said its WASH efforts \"yielded significant outcomes\" during March, with over 700,000 gallons (2.66 million litres) of chlorinated water distributed to displaced families and children.\n\nCollaborative efforts with partners such as the aid organizations Solidarit\u00e9s International, ORRAH, and ACTED, have ensured that essential needs were met even in the most challenging circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, UNICEF and partners have distributed hygiene kits to almost 11,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) across six sites.\n\nUNICEF has also prioritized improving sanitary conditions in the high-risk IDP sites, including removing and safely disposing about 78 cubic metres of fecal sludge from three sites accommodating roughly 7,000 people.\n\nMr. Um Bayiha upheld the agency's commitment to addressing evolving needs, particularly as the region braces for the upcoming hurricane season.\n\nYet, he warned that \"this crisis will worsen unless the response is scaled up urgently,\" underscoring the need for funding.\n\nUNICEF aims to support more than 884,000 people across Haiti this year to access quality water for drinking and domestic needs, as well as appropriate sanitation services and critical WASH supplies.", "source":

However, ongoing violence continues to pose significant challenges to our partners in reaching the affected population in certain areas of Port-au-Prince, despite the availability of ample stock of therapeutic food. Across the country, UNICEF is also supporting health facilities and its partners with the provision of supplies that are critical for the treatment of common childhood illnesses and malnutrition prevention, including vitamin A supplements and deworming tablets.\n\nUNICEF and partners forecast an alarming 19 percent increase in the number of children projected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Haiti this year.

But thank God. With the support of UNICEF and others, we now have drinking water in our neighborhoods, schools, clinic or health center , government lodge and few others which were not available on our returned\n\n\"But now we are glad to even have school that our children can go to school now. Unlike in the past when we arrived, no school, no.water supply, no houses , no clinic or hospital, no road to even New Marte from Dikwa. The road was bad feplorable and inaccessible but today , one.can drive to New Marte even without escort as one can drive to Gamboru Ngala without escort now.\n\n\"We are indeed grateful to UNICEF and their partners. We will remained grateful to them for coming to our aid. Although government is doing its best and playing its part alongside the military personnel. We remained indebted to UNICEF and other partners for the livelihood support and Sustainability projects they implemented in New Marte.\n\n\"With the new 1000 housing estates, Governor Zulum is building in New Marte, very soon all our people who are in IDPs camps in Monguno will also soon join us and that invariably , our population size will increase even 200% if all the necessary basic infrastructural facilities and amenities are not going to be provided before their relocation.\n\n\"Actually, we need additional health centers, schools, water, latrines, teachers, instructional materials and kits for the school. Like those UNICEF provides to our children in schools and more importantly, we also need electricity in the town among others,\" Ba Mai said.\n\nIt will be recalled that UNICEF for almost a decade now has been supporting the state government in several sectors with interventions in health emergencies, educational support to children and training of teachers as well as provision of instructional materials and kits to school children in partnership with some few partners to carry out some activities for the children and people of New Marte.\n\nMost especially, children and women have benefited from UNICEF interventions ranging from nutrition to water and hygiene as well as environmental sanitation , instructional materials and kits including vaccination and tests.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries, a mother of three children, Hadiza Alhaji said,\" when we came here , my smallest son was very sick couple with the change of weather, heat and wind storm which is different from that of Maiduguri city which we were becoming used to the environment.\"\n\n\"He fall sick and no clinic, no hospital , no where to go to safe my son's life until UNICEF came to our rescue. The treatment they gave to my son and even later my other two children who are about 4 and half years and almost 7 years helped us out.\n\n\"We are even thinking now of enrolling the first female child in school to learn like her counterparts in other places. I want the UNICEF and other partners to continue with their good work,\" Hadiza said.\n\nAnother returnee IDP in New Marte, Zainab Kolomi, said, \"my children right from Maiduguri city were actually battling with issue of balanced diet. Because we were not getting enough and proper care at the IDPs Camp even before we were relocated to New Marte by the Governor.\"\n\n\"So, the coming of UNICEF and other partners in New Marte safe our lives and those of our children. Their support and interventions gave us succour and relief to live a better life.\n\n\"The issue of water was terrible as there was no where to get drinking water. No where to rush for treatment or care if sick or ill especially the children to get proper care and attention or send children to school for learning and others.

Only one bakery remains operational, while food supplies will only last one to three days.\n\nThe economies of Latin America and the Caribbean will grow by 2.1% this year, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, which revises its projections slightly upwards.\n\nIn December, ECLAC estimated an expansion of the regional economy of 1.9%.\n\n\"The region is facing a complex international scenario, characterized by growth in economic activity and global trade below their historical averages, along with interest rates that remain high in developed countries, resulting in higher financing costs for emerging countries,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe only countries with falls in Gross Domestic Product are Argentina, with a decline of 3.1%, and Haiti with a drop of 2%, while Brazil will grow by 2.3% and Mexico by 2.5%. Venezuela would grow 4%.\n\nThe floods in Brazil leave more than a hundred dead and dozens missing in Brazil\n\n\u00a9 Ag\u00eancia Brasil/Gilvan Rocha\n\nThe devastating floods in southern Brazil have so far left 108 dead and 136 missing, in addition to 374 injured, according to the Brazilian government's balance sheet.\n\nUNICEF is helping to assess the situation of children and adolescents in shelters.\n\nThe UN Fund will also provide technical support to minors separated from their parents and guardians.\n\nThe agency is sending educational packets to shelters and creating dedicated spaces for children in shelters.\n\nIn addition, it will distribute menstrual and baby hygiene products.\n\nUNICEF supplies drinking water to more than 30,000 children in Haiti\n\n\u00a9 UNICEF/Ralph Tedy Erol\n\nIn Haiti, UNICEF has provided drinking water to more than 30,000 children and families in the capital, engulfed in chaos by violence.\n\nThe situation is further aggravated by the rainy season, which causes major flooding in low-lying areas of Port-au-Prince and the resurgence of cholera cases in the Cite Soleil area.\n\nWithout clean water and adequate sanitation and hygiene facilities, displaced children are exposed to waterborne diseases, such as cholera outbreaks.\n\n\"Operating in such an insecure and volatile environment is like navigating a war zone every day,\" says the agency, which has supplied some 2.66 million liters of drinking water to 20 internally displaced persons sites in the city.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

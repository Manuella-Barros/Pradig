{"id": 225003666, "title": "MegaWatt Metals Provides Work Program Plans for Benedict Mountains Uranium Property in Labrador's Central Mineral Belt", "text": "In 2006, a program of reconnaissance geology/prospecting, lake and stream sediment sampling was completed on the Benedict Mountains Uranium Property, which defined 8 significant multi-element anomalies. In 2007/2008, global geo-data leader Fugro completed an airborne radiometric and magnetic survey. Follow-up prospecting, channel sampling, geological mapping and detailed ground radiometric surveys identified 3 uranium showings (i.e., Priority One, Harbinger, and Powe) that were selected for future drill testing. MegaWatt\u2019s CEO, Casey Forward, commented: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to build on the exploration to date that\u2019s produced such encouraging results. Fugro\u2019s data from the airborne survey proved very useful, since most of the radiometric anomalies reflected outcropping radioactive material. The survey also discovered several new radioactive zones and expanded the zones that were discovered in 2006. We\u2019re also interested in gathering more data on the local presence of anomalous precious and base metals on the property. A lot of heavy lifting has already been done. Now we\u2019re looking forward to gaining a much more detailed picture of the property\u2019s full mineral potential.\u201d", "summary": "Central Mineral Belt contains Michelin, one of North America\u2019s largest uranium deposits Past property exploration found several high-grade uranium showings, sampling up to 13.8% U3O8 Work program stages, dates and timelines will be released as available Vancouver, British Columbia, May 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; MegaWatt Lithium and Battery Metals Corp.

The verdict will not be read in court but will be sent out electronically. Matapour will have the verdict read to him in prison, the court said.\n\nMatapour was overpowered by bystanders after the attack and arrested. Following the attack, a Pride parade was canceled, with police saying they could not guarantee security.\n\nThe shooting shocked Norway, which has a relatively low crime rate but has experienced a series of \"lone wolf\" attacks by individuals in recent decades, including one of the worst mass shootings in Europe. In 2011, a right-wing extremist killed 69 people on the island of Utoya after setting off a bomb in Oslo that left eight dead.\n\nFILE - Zaniar Matapour appears in court in Oslo, Norway, March 12, 2024. A verdict is expected Thursday, July 4, in case of the Iranian-born Norwegian man who is charged with terrorism for the 2022 deadly shooting at an Oslo LGBTQ Pride festival.

Two people were killed and nine were seriously wounded in the shooting at three locations, chiefly outside the London Pub, a popular gay bar, on June 25, 2022. The Oslo District Court said Zaniar Matapour shot 10 rounds with a machine gun and eight shots with a handgun into the crowd, per the AP. It said Matapour had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State group and \"has been radicalized for several years.\" His 30-year sentence was the highest penalty in Norway since terror legislation was changed in 2015. Matapour can request parole after 20 years but can only be released if he's deemed no longer dangerous.\n\nProsecutor Aud Kinsarvik Gravas called it \"the right outcome\" and \"a historically severe punishment.\" Matapour's lawyer, Marius Dietrichson, said it was \"a severe punishment\" and that they haven't yet decided whether to appeal. Espen Evjenth, who was hit by a bullet in the forehead at the London Pub, told the Norwegian news agency NTB that it was \"a great relief.\" Extensive video material of the attack had been presented in court. The verdict wasn't read in court but sent out electronically. Matapour would have the verdict read to him in prison, the court said.\n\nMatapour was overpowered by bystanders after the attack and arrested. Following the attack, a Pride parade was canceled, with police saying they couldn't guarantee security. Matapour had pleaded innocent. He was examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist who concluded that he was sane at the time of the attack. During the trial, both the prosecution and the defense agreed that Matapour fired into the crowd and there was no disagreement that the shooting was terror-motivated. However, Dietrichson had sought acquittal, saying his client had been provoked to carry out the attack by an E-Tjenesten agent who was pretending to be a high-ranking ISIS member.\n\nThe trial started in March and ended May 16. Four others are suspected of complicity in the case, but none has been formally charged. The shooting shocked Norway, which has a relatively low crime rate but has experienced a series of \"lone wolf\" attacks by individuals in recent decades, including one of the worst mass shootings in Europe. In 2011, a right-wing extremist killed 69 people on the island of Utoya after setting off a bomb in Oslo that left eight dead.

Matapour, an Iranian-born Norwegian citizen, was sentenced to 30 years, extendable indefinitely. The attack resulted in two deaths and numerous injuries. The verdict was announced soon after Oslo's annual Pride parade.\n\nA Norwegian court found a man guilty of conducting a deadly shooting rampage at a gay bar in Oslo in 2022 during the city's annual Pride celebrations, Norwegian media organisations NRK, TV2, Dagbladet and VG reported on Thursday. The verdict will be made public at 1300 CET (1100 GMT). The court sent it to the parties involved ahead of that time.\n\nMatapour will serve 30 years in prison, which could be extended indefinitely if he is deemed to continue to pose a threat to society, the media organisations reported, a sentence that is in line with what the prosecution had asked for. Lawyers for Matapour and the prosecution were not immediately available for comment. A lawyer representing victims' families declined to comment before the verdict was made public.\n\nTwo people died, nine suffered gunshot wounds and 25 others were injured after the shooting at the London Pub, a longstanding hub of Oslo's LGBTQ+ scene, as well as a nearby bar in the centre of the Norwegian capital. Zaniar Matapour, a 45-year-old, Iranian-born Norwegian citizen, described by police as a radicalised Islamist with a history of mental illness, stood trial on charges of committing gross terrorism and murder.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if he would appeal the verdict. Matapour declared himself not guilty. The verdict comes days after Oslo's annual Pride parade, which paid tribute to the memories of the victims of the shooting.\n\nAn estimated 70,000 revellers - the equivalent of 10% of Oslo's population - marched in this year's event, a number a little under last year's record of 90,000 participants. According to the charges against him, Matapour started shooting at about 1:13 a.m. local time, some 50 minutes after swearing allegiance to the Islamic State.\n\nHe fired two weapons at people inside and outside the venues, including some who tried to hide or run away, according to the charges. An independent inquiry into the authorities' response concluded in 2023 that police could have prevented the attack had they acted on a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagbladet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dagbladet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdens_Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verdens Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_2_(Denmark)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TV 2 (Denmark)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRK", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NRK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pride parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Ski-orienteering", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Ski-orienteering", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/01_04_2019_17_12_02_6631371.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705838", "eventUri": "eng-9705838", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nPsychiatric experts have been divided over his mental health, and thereby his legal responsibility, as the accused has previously been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nBut the public prosecutor considered him criminally responsible and said that he deliberately targeted the LGBTQ community.\n\nDuring the trial, Matapour's lawyer accused an undercover agent with Norway's domestic security service of provoking the attack by encouraging his client to pledge allegiance to IS.\n\nHe pleaded for his client to be declared criminally irresponsible, which would lead to his mandatory transfer to a secure psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn June 2023, the intelligence agency apologised after a report it commissioned, with the chief of police concluding it could have prevented the attack.\n\nOn May 3, Pakistan extradited the suspected mastermind -- Arfan Bhatti, a 46-year-old who lived in Norway.\n\nBhatti left Norway for Pakistan before Matapour carried out the shooting.\n\nBhatti, an alleged \"accomplice to an aggravated act of terror\", has denied any involvement and opposed his extradition.\n\nHe will be tried at a later date.\n\nOslo's Pride festival, scheduled to take place a few hours after the shooting, was eventually cancelled.\n\nphy/ef/thm/ju/sbk/giv/ach\n\nMore from this section\n\nCenterpoint Appoints Galen

It said Matapour had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State group and \"has been radicalized for several years.\"\n\nHis 30-year sentence was the highest penalty in Norway since terror legislation was changed in 2015.\n\nMatapour can request parole after 20 years but can only be released if he is deemed no longer dangerous.\n\nProsecutor Aud Kinsarvik Grav\u00e5s called it \"the right outcome\" and \"a historically severe punishment.\" Matapour's lawyer, Marius Dietrichson, said it was \"a severe punishment\" and that they have not yet decided whether to appeal.\n\nEspen Evjenth, who was hit by a bullet in the forehead at the London Pub, told the Norwegian news agency NTB that it was \"a great relief.\"\n\nExtensive video material of the attack had been presented in court. The verdict was not read in court but sent out electronically. Matapour would have the verdict read to him in prison, the court said.\n\nMatapour was overpowered by bystanders after the attack and arrested. Following the attack, a Pride parade was canceled, with police saying they could not guarantee security.\n\nThe shooting shocked Norway, which has a relatively low crime rate but has experienced a series of \"lone wolf\" attacks by individuals in recent decades, including one of the worst mass shootings in Europe. In 2011, a right-wing extremist killed 69 people on the island of Utoya after setting off a bomb in Oslo that left eight dead.\n\nSix days before the attack, Norway's external intelligence agency, E-Tjenesten, learned from an undercover agent that a possible action was expected in a Nordic country and the information was passed to the domestic security service.\n\nMatapour had pleaded innocent. He was examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist who concluded that he was sane at the time of the attack.\n\nDuring the trial, both the prosecution and the defense agreed that Matapour fired into the crowd and there was no disagreement that the shooting was terror motivated. However, Dietrichson had sought acquittal, saying his client had been provoked to carry out the attack by an E-Tjenesten agent who was pretending to be a high-ranking member of the Islamic State group.\n\nThe court said that \"it is clear that the actions of the E-Tjenesten did not involve any illegal provocation\" and \"did not provoke an act of terrorism that would not otherwise have been committed.\"\n\nThe trial started in March and ended May 16.\n\nFour others are suspected of complicity in the case, but none has been formally charged.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In 2011, a right-wing extremist killed 69 people on the island of Utoya after setting off a bomb in Oslo that left eight dead.\n\nSix days before the attack, Norway's external intelligence agency, E-Tjenesten, learned from an undercover agent that a possible action was expected in a Nordic country and the information was passed to the domestic security service.\n\nMatapour had pleaded innocent. He was examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist who concluded that he was sane at the time of the attack.\n\nDuring the trial, both the prosecution and the defense agreed that Matapour fired into the crowd and there was no disagreement that the shooting was terror motivated. However, Dietrichson had sought acquittal, saying his client had been provoked to carry out the attack by an E-Tjenesten agent who was pretending to be a high-ranking member of the Islamic State group.\n\nThe court said that \"it is clear that the actions of the E-Tjenesten did not involve any illegal provocation\" and \"did not provoke an act of terrorism that would not otherwise have been committed.\"\n\nThe trial started in March and ended May 16.

An independent inquiry into the authorities' response concluded in 2023 that police could have prevented the attack had they acted on a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagbladet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dagbladet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_2_(Denmark)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TV 2 (Denmark)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRK", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NRK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdens_Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Verdens Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pride parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Ski-orienteering", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Orienteering/Ski-orienteering", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_06_2024_10_03_43_9798108.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705838", "eventUri": "eng-9705838", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

A man aged 54 and another aged 60 died. Dozens of others were injured, with nine suffering gunshot wounds.\n\nThe attack occurred at nightclub London Pub in Oslo and another nearby bar in the Norwegian capital during Pride celebrations.\n\nAccording to the charges, Matapour started shooting at about 1.13am, after swearing allegiance to the Islamic State jihadist group in an audio recording sent to a friend. He fired two weapons at people at the venues. Terrified revellers hid in a basement and phoned loved ones as the shots rang out.\n\nMatapour was arrested the same day and later charged with aggravated terrorism.\n\nDescribed by police as a radicalised Islamist with a history of mental illness, Matapour, 45, will serve 30 years in prison, with a minimum detention time of 20 years, which could be extended indefinitely if he is seen to still pose a threat to society, Reuters reported.\n\nThis is the longest sentence possible under Norwegian law.\n\nHe was also ordered to pay about 112 million Norwegian crowns ($10.6 million/\u00a38.3 million) in compensation to survivors and relatives.\n\nChristian Lundin, representing the victims of the attack, told Reuters the judgement was \"well-reasoned\", adding: \"On behalf of the plaintiffs, we are very satisfied that the court has awarded compensation in accordance with the claims made on behalf of the 312 individuals (affected).\"\n\nMatapour's lawyer, Marius Dietrichson, told Reuters: \"I have to read the verdict in more detail and go through it with my client.

The sentence, the longest possible under Norwegian law, is in line with what the prosecution had asked for.\n\n\"The court finds that the actions in their entirety are so serious that the maximum sentence should be applied,\" the court said in its verdict.\n\nMatapour was also ordered to pay compensation amounting to around 112 million crowns ($10.6 million) to survivors and relatives of the victims.\n\n\"We are pleased to have received a thorough and well-reasoned judgment by the Oslo District Court,\" Christian Lundin, representing the victims of the attack, said in an emailed statement to Reuters.\n\n\"On behalf of the plaintiffs, we are very satisfied that the court has awarded compensation in accordance with the claims made on behalf of the 312 individuals (affected).\"\n\nIt is not yet clear whether Matapour will appeal.\n\n\"I have to read the verdict in more detail and go through it with my client. My advice to him is that he should consider appealing the verdict,\" Matapour's lawyer, Marius Dietrichson, told Reuters.\n\nIt came days after Oslo's latest annual Pride parade, which paid tribute to the memories of the victims of the shooting.\n\nAn estimated 70,000 revellers - the equivalent of 10% of Oslo's population - marched in this year's event, a number a little under last year's record of 90,000 participants.\n\nAccording to the charges against him, Matapour started shooting at about 1:13 a.m. local time, some 50 minutes after swearing allegiance to the Islamic State jihadist group in an audio recording sent to a friend.\n\nHe fired two weapons at people inside and outside the venues, including some who tried to hide or run away, according to the charges.\n\nAn independent inquiry into the authorities' response concluded in 2023 that police could have prevented the attack had they acted on a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency.\n\n(Reporting by Gwladys Fouche in Oslo, Stine Jacobsen and Isabelle Yr Carlsson in Copenhagen, Anna Ringstrom in Stockholm;

IS.\n\nHe pleaded for his client to be declared criminally irresponsible, which would lead to his mandatory transfer to a secure psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn June 2023, the intelligence agency

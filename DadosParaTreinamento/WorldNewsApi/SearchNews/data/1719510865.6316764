Netflix star Charles Dance, 77, and girlfriend Alessandra Masi, 55, soak up the...", "text": "The Crown star Charles Dance and girlfriend Alessandra Masi have been topping up their tans on a nudist beach during a sunny getaway to the Spanish Island of Formentera. The actor, 77, who played the older Louis Mountbatten in the Netflix series, showcased his toned physique as he strolled along the sands before taking a cool dip in the ocean. Italian Alessandra, 55, also displayed her youthful figure and tied back her curly locks into a bun before joining the Game Of Thrones star in the water on Saturday. The couple, who met on the set of his 2020 film, The Book of Vision, later retreated to their towels and took shelter from the scorching sun beneath an umbrella. Charles and Alessandra then wore casual ensembles as they enjoyed a spot of retail therapy at the Island's nearby designer stores. The couple wore shorts and sandals as they strolled together hand-in-hand with chivalrous Charles carrying their shopping. When they met Alessandra was working as a production manager on the surreal historical movie which was shot on locations in Italy and Belgium. The film features Charles as two doctors \u2013 one in modern London and the other in 18th century Prussia. Asked what was his main memory of the movie, he said: \u2018To be honest, it\u2019s meeting Alessandra.' The couple have now been together for around four years. Charles was married to Joanna Haythorn from 1970 to 2004, and they have two grown-up children. He then dated actress Sophia Myles, then in her 20s, who has starred in films including Thunderbirds, but they split in 2005. Charles was also linked to French-born ex-Gucci model Shambhala Marthe, and then dated artist Eleanor Boorman for four years. Despite welcoming baby daughter Rose together in 2012 and even getting engaged, the couple split months later. It comes after Charles revealed his 34-year marriage broke down when he came clean to his wife about 'succumbing to some temptations'. The star told of his 'huge regret' that his relationship with sculptor Joanne came to an end when they divorced in 2004 after he admitted he had cheated on her. The couple - who had two children together, son Oliver, 50, and Rebecca, 44 - wed in 1970. The charismatic actor blamed his behaviour on becoming an unlikely sex symbol after starring in the 1984 TV drama The Jewel in the Crown as he admitted he succumbed to his libido. But he said he is grateful his ex-wife was able to forgive him 18 months after he destroyed their three decade marriage and are now 'best friends'. Speaking to Gyles Brandreth on the Rosebud podcast, he said: 'For the most part it was a wonderful marriage, but then, unfortunately, I succumbed to some temptations along the way and the marriage ended because of my behaviour really.' The couple were living in Somerset, spending their days at separate ends of the 'enormous' house, when he broke the news to her about his cheating past. 'I eventually had to come clean,' he said. 'Because we were living in Somerset, in this enormous place, and Jo had her study at one end and I had mine at the other end, and we became a bit like George and Martha (in the play) Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? really after a while. 'Eventually I came back and I thought, 'really, we have to have [a] very serious conversation'. And I had to come clean and it came as a shock to Jo, bless her.' He told the host he never saw himself as attractive but his eyes began to wander when he starred as Guy Perron in The Jewel in the Crown and people started saying he was 'the thinking woman's crumpet' . 'I always felt very grateful if girls behaved as if they were attracted to me,' he said. 'But there is no justification for it, you know. 'In our business, Gyles, temptation is often presented and you have to be pretty together and balanced, and have not a particularly powerful libido to not succumb to that. 'So, the marriage came to an end \u2013 huge regret. But after about 18 months, Jo and I, thankfully, became the best of friends, and we remain so, thank God. 'She had a flat not very far away from where I live and we saw each other quite frequently, and so it kind of all turned out all right in the end.' He confessed it took him a long time to learn the law of cause and effect and he would have done things differently in his marriage if he could turn back time.", "summary": "The actor, 77, who played the older Louis Mountbatten in the Netflix series, showcased his toned physique as he strolled along the sands before taking a cool dip in the ocean.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13461383/The-Crown-Netflix-Charles-Dance-girlfriend-Alessandra-Masi-NAKED.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/26/13/85351293-0-image-m-77_1716728070657.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2023/12/01/8653546679340546710/1024x576_MP4_8653546679340546710.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:23:23", "author": "Editor,Geraint Llewellyn", "authors": ["Editor", "Geraint Llewellyn"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.487}

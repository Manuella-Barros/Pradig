All of the men are to remain in custody until at least June 23.\n\nIvanov, an ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, was jailed pending an investigation and trial on charges of bribery, court officials said in a statement. He was in charge of military construction projects and was previously accused of living a lavish lifestyle in anti-corruption investigations conducted by the team of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nMoscow's court service said Fomin and Borodin contributed to Ivanov receiving a \"particularly large bribe\" - an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nIvanov, 48, was sanctioned by both the United States and European Union in 2022 after Russia\u00b4s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a court statement, investigators told the judge that Ivanov conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nThis handout photo taken from video released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Thursday, Jan 11, 2024, shows Timur Ivanov, deputy defense minister, in Moscow.

(Russian Defense Ministry Press Service photo via AP)\n\nIvanov\u00b4s lawyer, Murad Musayev, told the state news agency Tass on Wednesday that his client is accused of \"taking a bribe in the form of free construction and repair work on supposedly his personal properties,\" and in turn providing \"assistance to companies that were contractors for the Defense Ministry.\"\n\nAnother lawyer, Denis Baluyev, was quoted by state news agency RIA Novosti as saying Wednesday that Ivanov maintains his innocence.\n\nAccording to the Defense Ministry\u00b4s website, Ivanov was appointed in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nRIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov\u00b4s arrest, which comes as Moscow\u00b4s war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets reported Wednesday that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nPeskov dismissed the suggestion and described the reports as speculation. \"There are a lot of rumors. We need to rely on official information,\" he told journalists.\n\nMusayev, Ivanov\u00b4s lawyer, also denied any other charges, telling RIA Novosti Ivanov faced only bribery allegations.\n\nBefore his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass. The move against Ivanov came nearly a month after Putin called on the FSB to \"keep up a systemic anti-corruption effort\" and pay special attention to state defense procurement.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov oversaw some of the construction in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city that was devastated by bombardment and occupied by Russian forces early in the war.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of opposition leader Navalny alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owned elite real estate. The activists also alleged that Ivanov\u00b4s wife, Svetlana, divorced him in 2022 to avoid sanctions and continued living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nThe prosecution of high-level officials for corruption remains relatively rare in Russia.\n\nIn April 2023, former Deputy Culture Minister Olga Yarilova was arrested and charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles ($2.2 million). Yarilova, who held her post from 2018 to 2022, is on trial and facing a possible seven-year jail term.\n\nFormer Economics Minister Alexei Ulyukayev received an eight-year prison sentence in 2017 for accepting a $2 million bribe from one of Putin\u00b4s top associates. The high-profile trial was widely seen as part of infighting between Kremlin clans. Ulyukayev, now 68, was granted early release from prison in May 2022.\n\nThis photo taken and released by Basmanny District Court press service on Wednesday, April 24, 2024, shows Timur Ivanov, Russian deputy Defense Minister, standing in a glass cage in the Basmanny District Court in Moscow, Russia.

said.\n\nThe daily Izvestia reported this morning that searches were also conducted late last night on some of the minister's properties.\n\nRussian news reports said Ivanov was likely the most senior Russian official to face such charges since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - and if convicted, could face up to 15 years in prison.\n\nForbes magazine listed him as an expert in cybernetics and the nuclear industry, as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.\n\nBut during his storied career in Russia's defence ministry, Ivanov was responsible primarily for overseeing the construction and maintenance of key military facilities.\n\n'Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,' an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency.\n\nFSB military counter-intelligence was involved in the investigation into Ivanov's practices, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nRussian Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov, pictured with his wife Svetlana in London\n\nIvanov's wife, Svetlana Ivanova, is a former television presenter and socialite\n\nThe pair have been snapped living the high life in the South of France, where they own several properties and luxury vehicles\n\nThey came under fire in 2016 - the year Ivanov was appointed deputy defence minister - after Ivanova shared a slew of racy images to social media depicting her scantily clad frolicking on beaches\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nHis wife, Svetlana Ivanova, is a former television presenter and socialite.\n\nThe pair have been snapped living the high life in the South of France, where they own several properties and luxury vehicles.\n\nThey came under fire in 2016 - the year Ivanov was appointed deputy defence minister - after Ivanova shared a slew of racy images to social media depicting her scantily clad frolicking on French beaches.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nHe became a deputy minister in 2016.", "source": {"uri":

The ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was arrested Tuesday evening, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.\n\nThe committee gave no further information, apart from saying Ivanov is suspected of taking an especially large bribe -- an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe Kremlin rejected some Russian media reports that Ivanov was suspected of treason.\n\nIvanov, 48, was sanctioned by both the United States and European Union in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a court statement, investigators told the judge that Ivanov had conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nAn acquaintance of Ivanov's, identified as Sergei Borodin, also was arrested and ordered jailed pending an investigation and trial on the same charges, court officials said.

He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nPeskov dismissed Russian media reports that the corruption allegations against Ivanov were intended to obscure additional allegations of high treason.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlet reported that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service or FSB.\n\nBefore his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other military brass. The move against Ivanov came nearly a month after Putin called on the FSB to \"keep up a systemic anti-corruption effort\" and pay special attention to state defense procurement.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov oversaw some of the construction in the Ukranian port city of Mariupol.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected residential buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of the late Alexei Navalny alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owning elite real estate.\n\nThis photo taken and released by Basmanny District Court press service on Wednesday, April 24, 2024, shows Sergei Borodin sitting in a glass cage in the Basmanny District Court in Moscow, Russia.

They gave no further information, apart from specifying that Ivanov is suspected of taking an especially large bribe - a criminal offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nAccording to a statement from the court, investigators told Moscow\u00b4s Basmany court Wednesday that Ivanov had conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nAn acquaintance of Ivanov's, identified as Sergei Borodin, was also arrested and ordered into pre-trial detention on the same charges, court officials said in a separate statement. Both men are to remain in custody until at least June 23.\n\nAccording to the defense ministry\u00b4s website, Ivanov was appointed to the post in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, construction and reconstruction of facilities.\n\nRussia\u00b4s state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that both President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu were informed about Ivanov\u00b4s arrest, which comes as Moscow\u00b4s war in Ukraine continues into its third year.\n\nBefore his arrest on Tuesday evening, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass.\n\nRussian media reported that he was in charge, among other things, of some of the construction in Mariupol - a port city in Ukraine\u00b4s partially occupied Donestk region which was heavily bombarded and occupied by Russian forces early on in the war in 2022.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in the summer of 2022 that the ministry \"is building an entire residential block\" in the severely damaged city and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites.\n\nThat same year, the team of the late Alexei Navalny, Russia\u00b4s most prominent opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner, alleged that Ivanov and his family had been living an extravagant life with luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and elite real estate. The opposition activists also alleged that Ivanov\u00b4s wife Svetlana divorced him in the summer of 2022, avoided sanctions and continued to enjoy the lavish lifestyle.\n\nCommenting on the detention of Ivanov on Tuesday, Navalny's ally Maria Pevchikh said on X, formerly Twitter: \"It's a good day today.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

the defense ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed to the post in 2016 by a presidential decree and oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, construction and reconstruction of facilities.\n\nRussian media claimed that he was in charge, among other things, of some of the construction in Mariupol -- a port city in Ukraine's partially occupied Donestk region

Ivanov, 48, was shown in uniform standing in a glass cage in court, frowning slightly, footage released by the court service showed.\n\n\"The investigation believes that Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties, teamed up with them in advance to commit an organised crime by an organised group,\" the court service said.\n\nIt said the conspiracy was to receive \"property and services on a particularly large scale during contract and sub-contract work for the ministry of defence.\"\n\nIvanov, who said he was innocent, faces 15 years in jail if convicted. State media gave the case full coverage.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption that has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nSome Russian bloggers, who have accused senior generals of incompetence, rejoiced at the apparent fall of a top military official long linked to the ostentatious opulence which Putin has made clear he does not want to see displayed in wartime.\n\nA Russian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ivanov was a close ally of Shoigu and that his arrest was a sharp blow for the defence minister. Shoigu, a Putin ally and one of Russia's most powerful men, is widely expected to keep his position in a coming government reshuffle.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin and Shoigu had been informed. The defence ministry made no comment. A close friend of Ivanov, Sergei Borodin, was also charged with conspiring to take bribes.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry, whose spending has spiralled since the war began.\n\nThe TASS state news agency said the investigation into Ivanov has been under way for some time and that the FSB's military counter-intelligence department was involved.\n\nThe Kremlin dismissed a Russian report that Ivanov may be suspected of treason as pure speculation.\n\nIvanov had long been the subject of journalistic investigations. Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, had alleged that Ivanov and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to the French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and a 19th Century mansion in Moscow.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures. Other investigations alleged corruption in Russia's reconstruction of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol now controlled by Russian forces.\n\nIvanov was unable to comment as he was in detention. Putin last month ordered the FSB to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nIvanov, who graduated with from Moscow State University with a mathematics degree, rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector before becoming deputy head of the Moscow region government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\n\"It is clear that this is a tectonic shift,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, a popular pro-Russian military blogger. \"And this is not about Ivanov...

He was previously deputy prime minister of the Moscow region, where Shoigu briefly served as governor.\n\nThe Kremlin has rejected reports in some Russian media that the real reason for Ivanov's arrest was that he was suspected of treason.\n\n\"There are many different interpretations around all this now... You need to focus on official information,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nHe also stated that President Vladimir Putin had been notified of Ivanov's detention in advance.\n\nIn 2022, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), the group founded by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, accused Ivanov of participating in \"corruption schemes during construction in the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia\".\n\nIn particular, it said he had profited from construction projects in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, much of which was destroyed by Russian bombing in the months following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBasmanny district court in Moscow remanded him in jail for two months on charges of entering into a criminal conspiracy with third parties in his role of supervising the construction and overhaul of defense ministry facilities.\n\nIf found guilty he could face up to 15 years in jail. A second man, Sergei Borodin, who was described as a friend of the Ivanov, also appeared in court on Moscow on similar charges.\n\nIvanov denied the allegations made against him by Russia's Investigative Committee. The section of Russia's criminal code under which Ivanov was detained - Part 6 of article 290 - applies when a suspected bribe exceeds one million roubles (\u00a38,620; $10,700).\n\nIvanov's arrest marks a rare move against a member of Russia's governing elite, many of whom are believed to have used their positions to amass vast personal fortunes.\n\nSome Russian commentators have said the arrest will be a blow to Shoigu. \"If he can't manage it, he will be next to fall. This person is 100% his man,\" one anonymous source told a popular military Telegram channel.\n\nIvanov has been sanctioned by the US and UK and is the subject of a travel ban and asset freeze imposed by the European Union, which describes him as being \"tenth in the overall hierarchy of the Russian military leadership\". -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news",

A close friend of Ivanov, Sergei Borodin, was also charged with conspiring to take bribes.\n\nOSTENTATIOUS WEALTH\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry, whose spending has spiralled since the war began.\n\nThe TASS state news agency said the investigation into Ivanov has been under way for some time and that the FSB's military counter-intelligence department was involved.\n\nThe Kremlin dismissed a Russian report that Ivanov may be suspected of treason as pure speculation.\n\nIvanov had long been the subject of journalistic investigations. Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, had alleged that Ivanov and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to the French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and a 19th Century mansion in Moscow.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures. Other investigations alleged corruption in Russia's reconstruction of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol now controlled by Russian forces.\n\nIvanov was unable to comment as he was in detention. Putin last month ordered the FSB to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nIvanov, who graduated with from Moscow State University with a mathematics degree, rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector before becoming deputy head of the Moscow region government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\n\"It is clear that this is a tectonic shift,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, a popular pro-Russian military blogger. \"And this is not about Ivanov... I hope this is only the beginning.\"\n\n(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge in Moscow, Darya Korsunskaya in London and Lidia Kelly; Editing by Ros Russell, Angus MacSwan and Timothy Heritage)", "source":

The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale\".\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, whom Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Let's just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russian law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation on the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of the Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defence ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and high-security installations.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They gave no further information, apart from specifying that Ivanov is suspected of taking an especially large bribe -- a criminal offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nAccording to a statement from the court, investigators told Moscow's Basmany court Wednesday that Ivanov had conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nAn acquaintance of Ivanov's, identified as Sergei Borodin, was also arrested and ordered into pre-trial detention on the same charges, court officials said in a separate statement. Both men are to remain in custody until at least June 23.\n\nAccording to the defense ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed to the post in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, construction and reconstruction of facilities.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that both President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu were informed about Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine continues into its third year.\n\nBefore his arrest on Tuesday evening, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass.\n\nRussian media reported that he was in charge, among other things, of some of the construction in Mariupol -- a port city in Ukraine's partially occupied Donestk region which was heavily bombarded and occupied by Russian forces early on in the war in 2022.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in the summer of 2022 that the ministry \"is building an entire residential block\" in the severely damaged city and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites.\n\nThat same year, the team of the late Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner, alleged that Ivanov and his family had been living an extravagant life with luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and elite real estate. The opposition activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife Svetlana divorced him in the summer of 2022, avoided sanctions and continued to enjoy the lavish lifestyle.\n\nCommenting on the detention of

They gave no further information, apart from specifying that Ivanov is suspected of taking an especially large bribe -- a criminal offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nAccording to a statement from the court, investigators told Moscow's Basmany court Wednesday that Ivanov had conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nAn acquaintance of Ivanov's, identified as Sergei Borodin, was also arrested and ordered into pre-trial detention on the same charges, court officials said in a separate statement. Both men are to remain in custody until at least June 23.\n\nAccording to the defense ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed to the post in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, construction and reconstruction of facilities.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that both President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu were informed about Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine continues into its third year.\n\nBefore his arrest on Tuesday evening, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass.\n\nRussian media reported that he was in charge, among other things, of some of the construction in Mariupol -- a port city in Ukraine's partially occupied Donestk region which was heavily bombarded and occupied by Russian forces early on in the war in 2022.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in the summer of 2022 that the ministry \"is building an entire residential block\" in the severely damaged city and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites.\n\nThat same year, the team of the late Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner, alleged that Ivanov and his family had been living an extravagant life with luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and elite real estate. The opposition activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife Svetlana divorced him in the summer of 2022, avoided sanctions and continued to enjoy the lavish lifestyle.\n\nCommenting on the detention of Ivanov on Tuesday, Navalny's ally Maria Pevchikh said on X, formerly Twitter: \"It's a good day today.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors":

Reuters\n\nRussian security services detained one of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's deputies on suspicion of taking major bribes, the highest-profile corruption case since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nDeputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov was detained on Tuesday, according to a brief 22-word statement by Russia's investigative committee. The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale\".\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defence ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and at high-security installations.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.", "source": {"uri": "kathmandupost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kathmandupost.com"}, "authors": [],

Suspected of accepting bribes, the general faces charges for which he could be sentenced to a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\nThe investigation and detention of the uniformed man is a rare event during the military campaign that Russia began 26 months ago against Ukraine.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Foundation of the deceased opponent Alexei Navalny had accused Ivanov in 2022 of benefiting from construction projects in the city of Mariupol, taken that year by Russian troops.\n\nThe news of his arrest was announced on Tuesday night by the Investigative Committee, which in Russia is responsible for investigating major crimes. Apart from the accusation, he did not offer additional details except to point out that the bribe he would have received is especially large, which justifies the long sentence he would face in a trial.\n\nThe news of this arrest has also reached the Kremlin. \"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been informed of the arrest of Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was also informed in advance,\" the president's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense published on its website around 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday photos of a meeting of senior officials of that department led by Shoigu and which Ivanov also attended.\n\nIvanov was brought to justice this Wednesday. The soldier pleaded not guilty before the Basmanni District Court of Moscow, which ordered him to be provisionally detained for two months, a measure that can be extended.\n\n\"The investigation believes that Ivanov was part of a criminal conspiracy with third parties, he teamed up with them in order for an organized group to commit a crime,\" the court's press service explained. The conspiracy was intended to receive \"properties and services on a particularly large scale during contracts and subcontracting work for the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nTimur Ivanov was born 48 years ago in Moscow, he is one of Shoigu's 12 deputy ministers and in 2022 he was sanctioned by the United States and the European Union, after Putin launched his \"special military operation\" against Ukraine.\n\nGraduated in Mathematics from Moscow State University (MGU), he made a career and rose in the Russian atomic energy sector. He worked as an advisor to the Minister of Energy before being appointed deputy head of the Moscow Oblast administration in 2012, when Shoigu was its governor.\n\nIvanov has been Deputy Defense Minister for almost eight years. Previously, he worked in the fuel and energy industrial complex of the Russian Army and ran a company dedicated to the construction of housing for military personnel.\n\nBefore his appointment as deputy minister Ivanov \"managed to fulfill several orders of special importance that were reported to Putin,\" writes Kommersant. For example, his company built the Sevastopol presidential cadet school (in Crimea) in three months of 2014, and in 2015 he completed the construction of the P\u00e1triot military park near Moscow.\n\nThe accusation against the soldier is based on testimonies and the result of operational activities that FSB military counterintelligence agents have been carrying out for quite some time, a source explained to the Tass agency.\n\nAccording to the Izvestia newspaper, along with the deputy minister, the agents also detained several people involved in the transfer of money through a \"complex chain of intermediaries.\" The investigation agents began searching several properties belonging to the vice minister's family on Tuesday night.\n\nTimur Ivanov's arrest has sparked rumors of infighting within the Russian military elite, as well as the possibility of him being charged with treason. Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov rejected the speculation and asked journalists to focus on official information.\n\nAs Deputy Minister of Defense, Ivanov was responsible for organizing the administration of assets, planning the purchase of assets (execution of works, provision of services) on behalf of Defense, construction, reconstruction and general repair of infrastructure for the needs of that ministry. Among his tasks was supervision of the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome.\n\nIn 2019, Forbes included Ivanov on the list of the richest men in Russia's law enforcement agencies.\n\nTimur Ivanov was the target of an investigation published in 2022 by the Anti-Corruption Foundation founded by opposition leader Alexei Navalni, who died in prison last February. According to this organization, banned in Russia after being accused of being \"extremist\", Ivanov reviewed and benefited from construction projects in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, under Russian control since that year.\n\nFrom exile, Mar\u00eda P\u00e9vchij, who was Navalni's spokesperson and directs the foundation's investigations, congratulated herself on social networks. \"Today is a

The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale.\"\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defense officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defense ministry. The defense ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defense procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Let's just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterized some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organizational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defense ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and at high-security installations.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.\n\nRead more:\n\nUkrainian drone strike in Zaporizhzhia region kills four: Russian officials\n\nRussian missiles

Ivanov, an ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, was arrested on Wednesday on charges of accepting a bribe. Fomin is accused of contributing to the bribe, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Ivanov oversaw military construction projects and has been accused of lavish living in anti-corruption investigations. Ivanov maintains his innocence and has denied facing any charges beyond bribery. The arrest comes amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and follows President Putin's call for increased anti-corruption efforts. The prosecution of high-level officials for corruption remains relatively rare in Russia.\n\nA third man has been detained in a bribery case involving a Russian deputy defense minister, Moscow's court service said on Thursday.\n\nIt said businessman Alexander Fomin is suspected of paying bribes to Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov, who was detained on Wednesday, as well as Ivanov's associate, Sergei Borodin. All of the men are to remain in custody until at least June 23. Ivanov, an ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, was jailed pending an investigation and trial on charges of bribery, court officials said in a statement. He was in charge of military construction projects and was previously accused of living a lavish lifestyle in anti-corruption investigations conducted by the team of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nMoscow's court service said Fomin and Borodin contributed to Ivanov receiving a \"particularly large bribe'' -- an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nIvanov, 48, was sanctioned by both the United States and European Union in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a court statement, investigators told the judge that Ivanov conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\" Ivanov's lawyer, Murad Musayev, told the state news agency Tass on Wednesday that his client is accused of \"taking a bribe in the form of free construction and repair work on supposedly his personal properties,\" and in turn providing \"assistance to companies that were contractors for the Defense Ministry.\" Another lawyer, Denis Baluyev, was quoted by state news agency RIA Novosti as saying Wednesday that Ivanov maintains his innocence.\n\nAccording to the Defense Ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nRIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets reported Wednesday that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nPeskov dismissed the suggestion and described the reports as speculation. \"There are a lot of rumors. We need to rely on official information,\" he told journalists.\n\nMusayev, Ivanov's lawyer, also denied any other charges, telling RIA Novosti Ivanov faced only bribery allegations. Before his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass. The move against Ivanov came nearly a month after Putin called on the FSB to \"keep up a systemic anti-corruption effort\" and pay special attention to state defense procurement.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov oversaw some of the construction in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city that was devastated by bombardment and occupied by Russian forces early in the war.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of opposition leader Navalny alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owned elite real estate. The activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife, Svetlana, divorced him in 2022 to avoid sanctions and continued living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nThe prosecution of high-level officials for corruption remains relatively rare in Russia.\n\nIn April 2023, former Deputy Culture Minister Olga Yarilova was arrested and charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles (USD 2.2 million). Yarilova, who held her post from 2018 to 2022, is on trial and facing a possible seven-year jail term.\n\nFormer Economics Minister Alexei Ulyukayev received an eight-year prison sentence in 2017 for accepting a USD 2 million bribe from one of Putin's top associates. The high-profile trial was widely seen as part of infighting between Kremlin clans. Ulyukayev, now 68, was granted early release from prison in May 2022.(AP) RUP\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

A Russian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ivanov was a close ally of Shoigu and that his arrest was a sharp blow for the defence minister.\n\nA Russian court on Wednesday ordered one of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's deputies be kept in custody on suspicion of taking bribes, the highest-profile corruption case since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov was detained on Tuesday at work by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, for accepting large bribes.\n\nMoscow's Basmanny District Court ordered Ivanov be kept in custody until June 23. Ivanov, 48, was shown in uniform standing in a glass cage in court, frowning slightly, footage released by the court service showed. \"The investigation believes that Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties, teamed up with them in advance to commit an organised crime by an organised group,\" the court service said.\n\nIt said the conspiracy was to receive \"property and services on a particularly large scale during contract and sub-contract work for the ministry of defence.\" Ivanov, who said he was innocent, faces 15 years in jail if convicted. State media gave the case full coverage.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption that has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces. Some Russian bloggers, who have accused senior generals of incompetence, rejoiced at the apparent fall of a top military official long linked to the ostentatious opulence which Putin has made clear he does not want to see displayed in wartime.\n\nA Russian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ivanov was a close ally of Shoigu and that his arrest was a sharp blow for the defence minister. Shoigu, a Putin ally and one of Russia's most powerful men, is widely expected to keep his position in a coming government reshuffle. The Kremlin said Putin and Shoigu had been informed. The defence ministry made no comment. A close friend of Ivanov, Sergei Borodin, was also charged with conspiring to take bribes.\n\nOSTENTATIOUS WEALTH Ivanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry, whose spending has spiralled since the war began.\n\nThe TASS state news agency said the investigation into Ivanov has been under way for some time and that the FSB's military counter-intelligence department was involved. The Kremlin dismissed a Russian report that Ivanov may be suspected of treason as pure speculation.\n\nIvanov had long been the subject of journalistic investigations. Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, had alleged that Ivanov and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to the French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and a 19th Century mansion in Moscow. Forbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures. Other investigations alleged corruption in Russia's reconstruction of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol now controlled by Russian forces.\n\nIvanov was unable to comment as he was in detention. Putin last month ordered the FSB to root out corruption in state defence procurement. Ivanov, who graduated with from Moscow State University with a mathematics degree, rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector before becoming deputy head of the Moscow region government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion. \"It is clear that this is a tectonic shift,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, a popular pro-Russian military blogger. \"And this is not about Ivanov... I hope this is only the beginning.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defense officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defense ministry.\n\nThe defense ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defense procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that.\n\nThe newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched.\n\nState television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence that has characterized some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organizational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defense ministry construction company that builds housing for soldiers and at high-security installations.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was arrested Tuesday evening, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.\n\nThe committee gave no further information, apart from saying Ivanov is suspected of taking an especially large bribe -- an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe Kremlin rejected some Russian media reports that Ivanov was suspected of treason.\n\nIvanov, 48, was sanctioned by both the United States and European Union in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a court statement, investigators told the judge that Ivanov had conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nAn acquaintance of Ivanov's, identified as Sergei Borodin, also was arrested and ordered jailed pending an investigation and trial on the same charges, court officials said. Both men are to remain in custody until at least June 23.\n\nAccording to the Defense Ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nPeskov dismissed Russian media reports that the corruption allegations against Ivanov were intended to obscure additional allegations of high treason.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlet reported that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nPeskov described the reports as speculation. \"There are a lot of rumors. We need to rely on official information,\" he told journalists.\n\nIvanov's lawyer also denied any other charges, telling RIA Novosti that he faced only bribery allegations.\n\nBefore his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other military brass.\n\nRussian media reported that he oversaw some of the construction in Mariupol -- a Ukrainian port city that was devastated by bombardment and occupied by Russian forces early in the war.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected residential buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of the late Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner, alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owning elite real estate. The activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife, Svetlana, divorced him in 2022 to avoid sanctions and continued living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nCommenting on Ivanov's case, Navalny's ally Maria Pevchikh said on social platform X: \"It's a good day today.\"\n\nThe prosecution of high-level officials for corruption remains relatively rare in Russia.\n\nThe most recent arrest in April 2023 saw former Deputy Culture Minister Olga Yarilova charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles ($2.2 million). Yarilova, who held her post between 2018 and 2022, is on trial and facing a seven-year jail term.\n\nFormer Economics Minister Alexei Ulyukayev received an eight-year prison sentence in 2017 for accepting a $2 million bribe from one of Putin's top associates. The high-profile trial was widely seen as part of infighting between Kremlin clans. Ulyukayev, now 68, was granted early release from prison in May 2022.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@arab.news",

Russian media reported that Ivanov was in charge, among other things, of large construction projects rebuilding the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which was heavily bombarded and taken by Russia as part of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, quoted by Russian news agencies, said a report on Ivanov's detention had been presented to President Vladimir Putin. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had been informed in advance of his detention, he said. The daily Izvestia reported on Wednesday, citing sources, that searches were conducted late on Tuesday at some of Ivanov's properties.\n\nRussian news reports said that Ivanov, if convicted, could face up to 15 years in prison. Forbes magazine listed Ivanov, an expert in cybernetics and the nuclear industry, as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.\n\nNews outlet RBK posted a picture of him attending a meeting of ministerial officials earlier on Tuesday chaired by Shoigu. Russian news reports said Ivanov was likely the most senior Russian official to face such charges since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nHe worked in companies dealing with fuel and energy and in the Moscow regional government before joining the defence ministry in 2010.

Ivanov, an ally of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, was jailed pending an investigation and trial on charges of bribery, court officials said in a statement.\n\nHe was in charge of military construction projects and was previously accused of living a lavish lifestyle in anti-corruption investigations conducted by the team of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. It is unclear what sparked the decision to charge him with bribery.\n\nIvanov, 48, was sanctioned by both the United States and European Union in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. President Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Wednesday that the construction projects that were overseen by Ivanov will continue.\n\nMoscow's court service said Fomin and Borodin contributed to Ivanov receiving a \"particularly large bribe\" -- an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison. As part of the case against Fomin and the deputy minister, the courts service added that Fomin did not pay for goods, work and services related to repairing and reconstructing buildings.\n\nRussian state news agency Tass reported Wednesday that a Moscow businessman whose company is involved in construction gave testimony which incriminated the deputy defence minister. Tass did not name the individual who gave the evidence, but public records and Russian newspapers say that Alexander Fomin owns half of the company, called Olimpsitistroy.\n\nIn 2021, Ivanov awarded Fomin and the co-owner of Olimpsitistroy a state award called For Merit to the Fatherland for building medical centers, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported.\n\nAccording to a court statement Wednesday, investigators told the judge that Ivanov conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nIvanov's lawyer, Murad Musayev, told the state news agency Tass on Wednesday that his client is accused of \"taking a bribe in the form of free construction and repair work on supposedly his personal properties,\" and in turn providing \"assistance to companies that were contractors for the Defence Ministry.\"\n\nAnother lawyer, Denis Baluyev, was quoted by state news agency RIA Novosti as saying Wednesday that Ivanov maintains his innocence.\n\nAllegations of other hidden charges\n\nAccording to the Defence Ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nRIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets reported Wednesday that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nPeskov dismissed the suggestion and described the reports as speculation. \"There are a lot of rumors. We need to rely on official information,\" he told journalists.\n\nMusayev, Ivanov's lawyer, also denied any other charges, telling RIA Novosti Ivanov faced only bribery allegations.\n\nBefore his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass. The move against Ivanov came nearly a month after Putin called on the FSB to \"keep up a systemic anti-corruption effort\" and pay special attention to state defense procurement.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov oversaw some of the construction in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city that was devastated by bombardment and occupied by Russian forces early in the war.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of opposition leader Navalny alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owned elite real estate. The activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife, Svetlana, divorced him in 2022 to avoid sanctions and continued living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nRare prosecution\n\nFew high-level officials have been prosecuted in Russia.\n\nIn April 2023, former Deputy Culture Minister Olga Yarilova was arrested and charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles ($2.2 million). Yarilova, who held her post from 2018 to 2022, is on trial and facing a possible seven-year jail term.\n\nFormer Economics Minister Alexei Ulyukayev received an eight-year prison sentence in 2017 for accepting a $2 million bribe from one of Putin's top associates. The high-profile trial was widely seen as part of infighting between Kremlin clans. Ulyukayev, now 68, was granted early release from prison in May 2022.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had been informed in advance of his detention, he said.\n\nThe daily Izvestia reported on Wednesday, citing sources, that searches were conducted late on Tuesday at some of Ivanov's properties.\n\nRussian news reports said that Ivanov, if convicted, could face up to 15 years in prison.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov, an expert in cybernetics and the nuclear industry, as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.\n\nNews outlet RBK posted a picture of him attending a meeting of ministerial officials earlier on Tuesday chaired by Shoigu.\n\nRussian news reports said Ivanov was likely the most senior Russian official to face such charges since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nHe worked in companies dealing with fuel and energy and in the Moscow regional government before joining the defence ministry in 2010.

Mr Ivanov (48) was shown in uniform standing in a glass cage in court, frowning slightly, footage released by the court service showed.\n\n\"The investigation believes that Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties, teamed up with them in advance to commit an organised crime by an organised group,\" the court service said.\n\nIt said the conspiracy was to receive \"property and services on a particularly large scale during contract and sub-contract work for the ministry of defence\".\n\nMr Ivanov, who said he was innocent, faces 15 years in jail if convicted. State media gave the case full coverage.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Mr Shoigu, who Mr Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption that has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nSome Russian bloggers, who have accused senior generals of incompetence, rejoiced at the apparent fall of a top military official long linked to the ostentatious opulence that Mr Putin has made clear he does not want to see displayed in wartime.\n\nA Russian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr Ivanov was a close ally of Mr Shoigu and that his arrest was a sharp blow for the defence minister. Mr Shoigu, a Putin ally and one of Russia's most powerful men, is widely expected to keep his position in a coming government reshuffle.\n\nThe Kremlin said Mr Putin and Mr Shoigu had been informed. The defence ministry made no comment. A close friend of Mr Ivanov, Sergei Borodin, was also charged with conspiring to take bribes.\n\nMr Ivanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry, whose spending has spiralled since the war began.\n\nThe Tass state news agency said the investigation into Mr Ivanov has been under way for some time and that the FSB's military counter-intelligence department was involved.\n\nThe Kremlin dismissed a Russian report that Mr Ivanov may be suspected of treason as pure speculation.\n\nMr Ivanov had long been the subject of journalistic investigations. Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, had alleged that Mr Ivanov and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to the French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and a 19th Century mansion in Moscow.\n\nForbes magazine listed Mr Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures. Other investigations alleged corruption in Russia's reconstruction of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol now controlled by Russian forces.\n\nMr Ivanov was unable to comment as he was in detention. Mr Putin last month ordered the FSB to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nMr Ivanov, who graduated with from Moscow State University with a mathematics degree, rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector before becoming deputy head of the Moscow region government under Mr Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\n\"It is clear that this is a tectonic shift,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, a popular pro-Russian military blogger. \"And this is not about Ivanov...

All of the men are to remain in custody until at least June 23.\n\nIvanov, an ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, was jailed pending an investigation and trial on charges of bribery, court officials said in a statement. He was in charge of military construction projects and was previously accused of living a lavish lifestyle in anti-corruption investigations conducted by the team of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nMoscow's court service said Fomin and Borodin contributed to Ivanov receiving a ''particularly large bribe\" -- an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nIvanov, 48, was sanctioned by both the United States and European Union in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a court statement, investigators told the judge that Ivanov conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services ''during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.''\n\nIvanov's lawyer, Murad Musayev, told the state news agency Tass on Wednesday that his client is accused of ''taking a bribe in the form of free construction and repair work on supposedly his personal properties,'' and in turn providing ''assistance to companies that were contractors for the Defense Ministry.''\n\nAnother lawyer, Denis Baluyev, was quoted by state news agency RIA Novosti as saying Wednesday that Ivanov maintains his innocence.\n\nAccording to the Defense Ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nRIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets reported Wednesday that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nPeskov dismissed the suggestion and described the reports as speculation. ''There are a lot of rumors. We need to rely on official information,'' he told journalists.\n\nMusayev, Ivanov's lawyer, also denied any other charges, telling RIA Novosti Ivanov faced only bribery allegations.\n\nBefore his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass. The move against Ivanov came nearly a month after Putin called on the FSB to ''keep up a systemic anti-corruption effort'' and pay special attention to state defense procurement.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov oversaw some of the construction in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city that was devastated by bombardment and occupied by Russian forces early in the war.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of opposition leader Navalny alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owned elite real estate. The activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife, Svetlana, divorced him in 2022 to avoid sanctions and continued living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nThe prosecution of high-level officials for corruption remains relatively rare in Russia.\n\nIn April 2023, former Deputy Culture Minister Olga Yarilova was arrested and charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles ($2.2 million). Yarilova, who held her post from 2018 to 2022, is on trial and facing a possible seven-year jail term.\n\nFormer Economics Minister Alexei Ulyukayev received an eight-year prison sentence in 2017 for accepting a $2 million bribe from one of Putin's top associates. The high-profile trial was widely seen as part of infighting between Kremlin clans. Ulyukayev, now 68, was granted early release from prison in May 2022.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ivanov, 48, dressed in his uniform, was shown standing in a glass cage in court, frowning slightly, footage released by the court service showed.\n\n\"The investigation believes that Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties, teamed up with them in advance to commit an organised crime by an organised group,\" the court service said.\n\nThe conspiracy was to receive \"property and services on a particularly large scale during contract and sub-contract work for the ministry of defence,\" the court service said.\n\nRussian media said he denied being guilty. He faces 15 years in jail if convicted. State media gave the case full coverage.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nSome Russian bloggers, who have long accused senior generals of incompetence, rejoiced at the apparent fall of a top military official long linked to the ostentatious opulence which Putin has made clear he does not want to see displayed in wartime.\n\nSome said the arrest could be a public lesson for the elite, though others said it was a blow for Shoigu, a close Putin ally and one of Russia's most powerful men.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. The defence ministry made no comment. A close friend of Ivanov's, Sergei Borodin, was also charged with conspiring to take bribes.\n\nOSTENTATIOUS WEALTH\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry - whose spending has spiralled since the start of the war.\n\nIvanov had long been the subject of journalistic investigations which alleged he and his family lived a lavish lifestyle complete with visits to Europe's most expensive boutiques and an array of deluxe real estate.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, investigated Ivanov.\n\nIt alleged that he and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and even a 19th Century mansion on one of Moscow's most elegant streets.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures. Other investigations alleged corruption in Russia's reconstruction of Mariupol, the Ukrainian city on the Sea of Azov that is controlled by Russian forces.\n\nIvanov was unable to comment as he was in detention. Putin last month ordered the FSB to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nIvanov, who graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University, rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.", "source": {"uri": "arnnewscentre.ae",

bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's

The court remanded Ivanov in custody for two months and said that according to the charges he had put himself in a position to benefit from hiring contractors for the ministry where he oversaw construction activities.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, whom President Vladimir Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces. The Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement. The Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Let's just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russian law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said. It was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion. Within the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle. Ivanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation on the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of the Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defence ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and high-security installations. Forbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV

All of the men are to remain in custody until at least June 23.\n\nIt is rare for such a high-ranking official to be accused of a crime in Russia. Ivanov, an ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, was jailed pending an investigation and trial on charges of bribery, court officials said in a statement. He was in charge of military construction projects and was previously accused of living a lavish lifestyle in anti-corruption investigations conducted by the team of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. It is unclear what sparked the decision to charge him with bribery.\n\nIvanov, 48, was sanctioned by both the United States and European Union in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. President Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Wednesday that the construction projects that were overseen by Ivanov will continue.\n\nMoscow's court service said Fomin and Borodin contributed to Ivanov receiving a \"particularly large bribe\" -- an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison. As part of the case against Fomin and the deputy minister, the courts service added that Fomin did not pay for goods, work and services related to repairing and reconstructing buildings.\n\nRussian state news agency Tass reported Wednesday that a Moscow businessman whose company is involved in construction gave testimony which incriminated the deputy defense minister. Tass did not name the individual who gave the evidence, but public records and Russian newspapers say that Alexander Fomin owns half of the company, called Olimpsitistroy.\n\nIn 2021, Ivanov awarded Fomin and the co-owner of Olimpsitistroy a state award called For Merit to the Fatherland for building medical centers, the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported.\n\nAccording to a court statement Wednesday, investigators told the judge that Ivanov conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nIvanov's lawyer, Murad Musayev, told the state news agency Tass on Wednesday that his client is accused of \"taking a bribe in the form of free construction and repair work on supposedly his personal properties,\" and in turn providing \"assistance to companies that were contractors for the Defense Ministry.\"\n\nAnother lawyer, Denis Baluyev, was quoted by state news agency RIA Novosti as saying Wednesday that Ivanov maintains his innocence.\n\nAccording to the Defense Ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nRIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets reported Wednesday that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nPeskov dismissed the suggestion and described the reports as speculation. \"There are a lot of rumors. We need to rely on official information,\" he told journalists.\n\nMusayev, Ivanov's lawyer, also denied any other charges, telling RIA Novosti Ivanov faced only bribery allegations.\n\nBefore his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass. The move against Ivanov came nearly a month after Putin called on the FSB to \"keep up a systemic anti-corruption effort\" and pay special attention to state defense procurement.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov oversaw some of the construction in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city that was devastated by bombardment and occupied by Russian forces early in the war.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of opposition leader Navalny alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owned elite real estate. The activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife, Svetlana, divorced him in 2022 to avoid sanctions and continued living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nFew high-level officials have been prosecuted in Russia.\n\nIn April 2023, former Deputy Culture Minister Olga Yarilova was arrested and charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles ($2.2 million). Yarilova, who held her post from 2018 to 2022, is on trial and facing a possible seven-year jail term.\n\nFormer Economics Minister Alexei Ulyukayev received an eight-year prison sentence in 2017 for accepting a $2 million bribe from one of Putin's top associates. The high-profile trial was widely seen as part of infighting between Kremlin clans. Ulyukayev, now 68, was granted early release from prison in May 2022.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov was detained on Tuesday at work by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, for accepting large bribes.\n\nMoscow's Basmanny District Court ordered Ivanov be kept in custody until June 23. Ivanov, 48, dressed in his uniform, was shown standing in a glass cage in court, frowning slightly, footage released by the court service showed. \"The investigation believes that Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties, teamed up with them in advance to commit an organised crime by an organised group,\" the court service said.\n\nThe conspiracy was to receive \"property and services on a particularly large scale during contract and sub-contract work for the ministry of defence,\" the court service said. Russian media said he denied being guilty. He faces 15 years in jail if convicted. State media gave the case full coverage.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces. Some Russian bloggers, who have long accused senior generals of incompetence, rejoiced at the apparent fall of a top military official long linked to the ostentatious opulence which Putin has made clear he does not want to see displayed in wartime.\n\nSome said the arrest could be a public lesson for the elite, though others said it was a blow for Shoigu, a close Putin ally and one of Russia's most powerful men. The Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. The defence ministry made no comment. A close friend of Ivanov's, Sergei Borodin, was also charged with conspiring to take bribes.\n\nOSTENTATIOUS WEALTH Ivanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry - whose spending has spiralled since the start of the war.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russian law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said. Ivanov had long been the subject of journalistic investigations which alleged he and his family lived a lavish lifestyle complete with visits to Europe's most expensive boutiques and an array of deluxe real estate.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, investigated Ivanov. It alleged that he and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and even a 19th Century mansion on one of Moscow's most elegant streets.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures. Other investigations alleged corruption in Russia's reconstruction of Mariupol, the Ukrainian city on the Sea of Azov that is controlled by Russian forces. Ivanov was unable to comment as he was in detention. Putin last month ordered the FSB to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nIvanov, who graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University, rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor. Some Russian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\n\"It is clear that this is a tectonic shift,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, one of the most popular pro-Russian military bloggers. \"And this is not about Ivanov... I hope this is only the beginning.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

It comes as spending on the military has ballooned amid its offensive on Ukraine.\n\nIvanov, 48, oversaw construction and procurement for the armed forces, and was linked to Russia's high-profile rebuilding of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, occupied by Moscow's forces.\n\n\"The deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation was sent to a pre-trial detention centre,\" the press service for Moscow courthouses said in a statement on social media.\n\nHe faces up to 15 years in prison for bribe-taking \"on a particularly large scale\", it added.\n\nALSO READ: Two detained in Poland for attack on Navalny ally: Lithuania president\n\nIvanov denies the charges, his lawyer told the state-run TASS news agency.\n\nSeveral independent Russian media outlets have alleged that Ivanov and his family acquired vast wealth through kick-backs on contracts he agreed at the ministry.\n\nIn December 2022, Navalny's team said they had obtained thousands of leaked emails from Ivanov's wife, Svetlana Maniovich, that showed a lavish lifestyle well beyond what his official salary could cover.\n\nThey said she had spent hundreds of thousands of euros on luxury cars, jewellery, clothes, parties, and renting premium property and yachts in the south of France.\n\nSome of the transactions were routed through third parties, including defence ministry contractors, they alleged.\n\nALSO READ: International reactions after Israel's reported attack on Iran\n\nThe Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin was in \"constant\" contact with Shoigu but refused to comment directly on Ivanov's arrest.\n\n\"There will be an investigation,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, cautioning against \"speculation\".\n\nIn court on Wednesday, Ivanov, 48, stood in a glass dock for defendants in military uniform.\n\nThe court said investigators believe he was part of a \"criminal conspiracy\" to take a \"bribe on a particularly large scale in the form of property services, during the course of contracting and subcontracting work for the defence ministry.\"\n\nThe judge sent him to pre-trial detention until at least June 23. He will be held at the notorious Lefortovo jail in Moscow, TASS reported.\n\nCampaigners, including Navalny, have long argued that corruption is endemic in Putin's Russia.\n\nArrests of high-profile government figures are rare, usually the result of political infighting, analysts say.\n\nActivists say the vast sums being poured into the Ukraine offensive has given officials new opportunities to enrich themselves through secretive procurement deals.\n\nRussian military bloggers, who have long criticised Shoigu's handling of the offensive, quickly linked Ivanov to the defence minister on social media.\n\nALSO READ: Russian peacekeepers started withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh: Kremlin\n\nIn a post criticising Ivanov, Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone repeatedly referred to him as \"Shoigu's Deputy\".\n\n\"He, like Shoigu, comes from the family clan,\" it said.\n\nFormer Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had accused Shoigu and other defence ministry officials of corruption and incompetence before his mysterious death last year.\n\nThe defence ministry has not commented on Ivanov's arrest.\n\nJust hours before investigators announced they had arrested Ivanov on Tuesday he

He was previously deputy prime minister of the Moscow region, where Mr Shoigu briefly served as governor.\n\nThe Kremlin has rejected reports in some Russian media that the real reason for Mr Ivanov's arrest was that he was suspected of treason.\n\n\"There are many different interpretations around all this now... You need to focus on official information,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nHe also stated that President Vladimir Putin had been notified of Mr Ivanov's detention in advance.\n\nIn 2022, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), the group founded by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, accused Mr Ivanov of participating in \"corruption schemes during construction in the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia\".\n\nIn particular, it said he had profited from construction projects in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, much of which was destroyed by Russian bombing in the months following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBasmanny district court in Moscow remanded him in jail for two months on charges of entering into a criminal conspiracy with third parties in his role of supervising the construction and overhaul of defence ministry facilities.\n\nIf found guilty he could face up to 15 years in jail. A second man, Sergei Borodin, who was described as a friend of the Mr Ivanov, also appeared in court on Moscow on similar charges.\n\nMr Ivanov denied the allegations made against him by Russia's Investigative Committee. The section of Russia's criminal code under which Mr Ivanov was detained - Part 6 of article 290 - applies when a suspected bribe exceeds one million roubles (\u00a38,620; $10,700).\n\nMr Ivanov's arrest marks a rare move against a member of Russia's governing elite, many of whom are believed to have used their positions to amass vast personal fortunes.\n\nSome Russian commentators have said the arrest will be a blow to Mr Shoigu. \"If he can't manage it, he will be next to fall. This person is 100% his man,\" one anonymous source told a popular military Telegram channel.\n\nMr Ivanov has been sanctioned by the US and UK and is the subject of a travel ban and asset freeze imposed by the European Union, which describes him as being \"tenth in the overall hierarchy of the Russian military leadership\".", "source": {"uri": "nationnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Let's just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russian law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence that has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"},

The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale.\"\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defense officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defense ministry. The defense ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defense procurement.\n\nRussian state news agency Tass and The Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The Izvestia said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told Tass. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, Tass said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterized some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organizational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defense ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and at high-security installations.", "source":

According to TASS, the specific provision under the criminal code pertains to bribes over 1 million rubles (~$10,000).\n\nRussia's Investigative Committee noted that an investigation is ongoing and did not provide any details on the allegations.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies told TASS that \"everything that is registered to (Ivanov) and his wife, as well as to his ex-wives and five children, including adopted ones, (and) all this property has already been seized\" for the purpose of interim measures should Ivanov be convicted.\n\nSeparately, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu signed an order to remove Ivanov from his position.\n\nIf found guilty, Ivanov could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. The accusations toward Ivanov form what is likely the highest-profile corruption case in Russia since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine.\n\nVarious Western countries have sanctioned Ivanov due to his role in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and he was previously the target of a December 2022 investigation by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, founded by late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nThe investigation alleged that Ivanov profited from construction projects in occupied Mariupol.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur_Ivanov", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timur Ivanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_Committee_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative Committee of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian ruble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Shoigu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_Vladimir_Putin_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to Vladimir Putin in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Corruption_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Corruption Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariupol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mariupol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2149375808.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506436", "eventUri": "eng-9506436", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 299, "textEnd": 307}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

It comes as spending on the military has ballooned amid its offensive on Ukraine.\n\nHe faces up to 15 years in prison for bribe-taking \"on a particularly large scale,\" it added. Ivanov denies the charges, his lawyer told the state-run TASS news agency. Several independent Russian media outlets have alleged that Ivanov and his family acquired vast wealth through kick-backs on contracts he agreed at the ministry.\n\nIn December 2022, Navalny's team said they had obtained thousands of leaked emails from Ivanov's wife, Svetlana Maniovich, that showed a lavish lifestyle well beyond what his official salary could cover.\n\nThey said she had spent hundreds of thousands of euros on luxury cars, jewelry, clothes, parties, and renting premium property and yachts in the south of France. Some of the transactions were routed through third parties, including defense ministry contractors, they alleged.\n\nThe Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin was in \"constant\" contact with Shoigu but refused to comment directly on Ivanov's arrest. \"There will be an investigation,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, cautioning against \"speculation.\"\n\nIn court on Wednesday, Ivanov, 48, stood in a glass dock for defendants in military uniform. The court said investigators believe he was part of a \"criminal conspiracy\" to take a \"bribe on a particularly large scale in the form of property services, during the course of contracting and subcontracting work for the defense ministry.\" It did not provide further details.\n\nThe judge sent him to pre-trial detention until at least June 23. He will be held at the notorious Lefortovo jail in Moscow, TASS reported.\n\nCampaigners, including Navalny, have long argued that corruption is endemic in Putin's Russia. Arrests of high-profile government figures are rare, usually the result of political infighting, analysts say.\n\nActivists say the vast sums being poured into the Ukraine offensive has given officials new opportunities to enrich themselves through secretive procurement deals.\n\nRussian military bloggers, who have long criticized Shoigu's handling of the offensive, quickly linked Ivanov to the defense minister on social media. In a post criticizing Ivanov, Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone repeatedly referred to him as \"Shoigu's Deputy.\" \"He, like Shoigu, comes from the family clan,\" it said. Former Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had accused Shoigu and other defense ministry officials of corruption and incompetence before his mysterious death last year.\n\nThe defense ministry has not commented on Ivanov's arrest.\n\nJust hours before investigators announced they had arrested Ivanov on Tuesday he had appeared in video footage published by the ministry in which Shoigu addressed top military brass about the state of the Ukraine offensive.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ivanov faces charges under a statute for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale,\" which could lead to a 15-year jail term if convicted.Russian security services detained one of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's deputies on suspicion of taking major bribes, the highest-profile corruption case since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nDeputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov was detained on Tuesday, according to a brief 22-word statement by Russia's investigative committee. The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale\".\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defence ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and at high-security installations.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [],

He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nRIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets reported Wednesday that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nPeskov dismissed the suggestion and described the reports as speculation. \"There are a lot of rumors. We need to rely on official information,\" he told journalists.\n\nMusayev, Ivanov's lawyer, also denied any other charges, telling RIA Novosti Ivanov faced only bribery allegations.\n\nBefore his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other top military brass. The move against Ivanov came nearly a month after Putin called on the FSB to \"keep up a systemic anti-corruption effort\" and pay special attention to state defense procurement.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov oversaw some of the construction in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city that was devastated by bombardment and occupied by Russian forces early in the war.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of opposition leader Navalny alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owned elite real estate. The activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife, Svetlana, divorced him in 2022 to avoid sanctions and continued living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nThe prosecution of high-level officials for corruption remains relatively rare in Russia.\n\nIn April 2023, former Deputy Culture Minister Olga Yarilova was arrested and charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles ($2.2 million). Yarilova, who held her post from 2018 to 2022, is on trial and facing a possible seven-year jail term.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"},

It also showed that the personal bills of Ivanov's wife were paid by a company engaged in the restoration of Mariupol.\n\nAccording to the FBK, which has been banned in Russia for alleged extremism, the minister divorced his wife to allow her to bypass EU sanctions.\n\n\"Today is a good day,\" said Maria Pevchikh, the head of investigations at the foundation, in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"The person involved in our investigation was detained on suspicion of bribery.

He was previously deputy prime minister of the Moscow region, where Mr Shoigu briefly served as governor.\n\nIn 2022, the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), the group founded by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, accused Mr Ivanov of participating in \"corruption schemes during construction in the territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia\".\n\nIn particular, it said he had profited from construction projects in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, much of which was destroyed by Russian bombing in the months following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBasmanny district court in Moscow remanded him in jail for two months on charges of entering into a criminal conspiracy with third parties in his role of supervising the construction and overhaul of defence ministry facilities.\n\nIf found guilty he could face up to 15 years in jail. A second man, Sergei Borodin, who was described as a friend of the Mr Ivanov, also appeared in court on Moscow on similar charges.\n\nMr Ivanov denied the allegations made against him by Russia's Investigative Committee. The section of Russia's criminal code under which Mr Ivanov was detained - Part 6 of article 290 - applies when a suspected bribe exceeds one million roubles (\u00a38,620; $10,700).\n\nMr Ivanov's arrest marks a rare move against a member of Russia's governing elite, many of whom are believed to have used their positions to amass vast personal fortunes.\n\nSome Russian commentators have said the arrest will be a blow to Mr Shoigu. \"If he can't manage it, he will be next to fall. This person is 100% his man,\" one anonymous source told a popular military Telegram channel.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that President Vladimir Putin had been notified of the detention in advance.\n\nMr Ivanov has been sanctioned by the US and UK and is the subject of a travel ban and asset freeze imposed by the European Union, which describes him as being \"tenth in the overall hierarchy of the Russian military leadership\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Fomin and Borodin on the matter.\n\nIvanov was a close ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who risks being damaged by the scandal. State news agency TASS quoted a source as saying that Shoigu had fired Ivanov since his arrest. TASS said investigators had seized all the bank accounts and property of Ivanov and his family.\n\nSome analysts see the affair as an attempt to weaken Shoigu and a sign of tensions and rivalries in the elite as Putin prepares to name a new government next month after being re-elected in March for another six-year term.\n\nShoigu, however, is expected to keep his job. Under his direction, Russian forces have regrouped and regained the initiative in Ukraine and have recorded a series of gains in the past two months.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defense ministry, whose spending has spiraled since the war began.\n\nHe had long been the subject of journalistic investigations.\n\nRussia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, had alleged that Ivanov and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to the French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and a 19th century mansion in Moscow.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.

The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale\".\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defence ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and at high-security installations.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.", "source": {"uri": "arynews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARY NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Ivanov was charged under Part 6 of Art. 290 of the Criminal Code (receiving a bribe on an especially large scale).\n\nAccording to investigators, Ivanov entered into a \"criminal conspiracy with third parties to commit a crime and received a large bribe in the form of property services provided during contracting and subcontracting works for the needs of the Defence Ministry.\"\n\nSecurity forces are conducting dozens of searches in several Russian regions in relation to the case of Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov, RBC reports.

The materials of Ivanov's criminal case are related to his official duties. He is suspected of receiving a bribe on an especially large scale (Part 6 of Article 290 of the Criminal Code). He faces up to 15 years in prison under this article.\n\nTimur Ivanov did not plead guilty at court.\n\nThe materials of the case against Ivanov are based on the testimony of witnesses and the results of operational activities.

Operational support of the criminal case is carried out by the military counterintelligence of the FSB.\n\nIvanov is \"a man of Shoigu's.\" He \"had problems\" and \"there were questions to him\". His detention may be related to Shoigu's possible departure from the ministry, Forbes said with reference to a source at the Defence Ministry. There is no official confirmation to such reports.\n\nDeputy Defense Minister Ivanov is allegedly suspected of treason, whereas his bribery case appears to be just art of the charges that could be exposed to the public, sources of \"Important Stories\" said.\n\nHowever, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that one should believe official information only.\n\n\"There are a lot of different rumours around this whole thing, one needs to rely on official information, all these discussions are speculations around this case,\" Peskov said.\n\nThree more people were detained in this case, previously all of them were employees of the Defence Ministry or government agencies.\n\nInvestigative measures are being carried out at Ivanov's dacha in Dagestan.\n\nSeveral people who were considered to be involved in the transfer of money through a \"complex chain of intermediaries,\" were also arrested, Izvestia said.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin knew in advance about Ivanov's detention, Kremlin's official spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale\".\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defence ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and at high-security installations.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.

Ivanov, 48, dressed in his uniform, was shown standing in a glass cage in court, frowning slightly, footage released by the court service showed.\n\n\"The investigation believes that Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties, teamed up with them in advance to commit an organised crime by an organised group,\" the court service said.\n\nThe conspiracy was to receive \"property and services on a particularly large scale during contract and sub-contract work for the ministry of defence,\" the court service said.\n\nRussian media said he denied being guilty. He faces 15 years in jail if convicted. State media gave the case full coverage.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nSome Russian bloggers, who have long accused senior generals of incompetence, rejoiced at the apparent fall of a top military official long linked to the ostentatious opulence which Putin has made clear he does not want to see displayed in wartime.\n\nSome said the arrest could be a public lesson for the elite, though others said it was a blow for Shoigu, a close Putin ally and one of Russia's most powerful men.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. The defence ministry made no comment. A close friend of Ivanov's, Sergei Borodin, was also charged with conspiring to take bribes.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry - whose spending has spiralled since the start of the war.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russian law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said.\n\nIvanov had long been the subject of journalistic investigations which alleged he and his family lived a lavish lifestyle complete with visits to Europe's most expensive boutiques and an array of deluxe real estate.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, investigated Ivanov.\n\nIt alleged that he and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and even a 19th Century mansion on one of Moscow's most elegant streets.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures. Other investigations alleged corruption in Russia's reconstruction of Mariupol, the Ukrainian city on the Sea of Azov that is controlled by Russian forces.\n\nIvanov was unable to comment as he was in detention. Putin last month ordered the FSB to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nIvanov, who graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University, rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\n\"It is clear that this is a tectonic shift,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, one of the most popular pro-Russian military bloggers. \"And this is not about Ivanov... I hope this is only the beginning.\"\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge and Lidia Kelly; Editing by Ros Russell and Angus MacSwan)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType":

The wealthy minister - fond of glamorous women and lavish parties - appeared in the dock today in military fatigues accused of taking a bribe.\n\nYet one news outlet today sensationally claimed Vladimir Putin has been convinced by unknown briefings that Ivanov has committed treason - and this is the real reason for his detention.\n\n\"A bribe is for the public. So far they don't want to talk publicly about treason - it's a big scandal, after all [he is] the Deputy Minister of Defence,\" a source told Important Stories news outlet.\n\nIvanov's wife Svetlana Maniovich\n\n\"No one would have detained him for corruption. Everyone there [in the Kremlin] knew about this for a long time,\" said a security source. Putin gave the command after he managed to convince us that we were talking about treason.\"\n\nAfter appearing in court, Ivanov was then humiliatingly ordered to change into civilian clothes before being taken away for two months of pre-trial detention from Basmanny district court in Moscow pending an FSB secret service probe into alleged corruption.\n\nHe was seen being held and pushed by the neck by an FSB officer. An alleged accomplice, Sergei Borodin, was also detained. His court appearance was shown widely by the state media suggesting a show trial is on the way, with a potential jail sentence of 15 years.\n\nIvanov, who holds a rank equivalent to an army general and was handcuffed in his office at the Defence Ministry, has now been slammed in grim Lefortovo jail in Moscow.\n\nVladimir Putin, Russian Defence Ministery Sergei Shoigu and Deputy Minister of Defence Timur Ivanov\n\nThe colourful Ivanov is known as one of Putin's wealthiest security officials and the dictator along with Shoigu was informed in advance that he was to be held\n\nThe arrest was seen as evidence of warring clans vying for power as Putin shuffles his regime following his latest inauguration next month.\n\nIvanov's humiliation could spell bad news for Shoigu who loses his key sidekick in the midst of war. The detained deputy minister had been nicknamed \"Shoigu's wallet\".\n\nBut the detained minister is also close to Putin's own mouthpiece Dmitry Peskov, who is also deputy head of the Kremlin administration. At one event Peskov - Putin's official spokesman - wore a bear's outfit as he partied alongside Ivanov.\n\nThe Russian Deputy Defence Minister attending a meeting in Moscow on April 23\n\nIvanov has ridden numerous past claims of corruption as he ran the military's infrastructure budget and rebuilt the blitzed and invaded Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nAnd corruption is endemic in the Putin regime, so analysts are searching to explain 'why him and why now'. The Important Stories security-linked source said: \"Now they are deciding what to do with him [Ivanov].\n\n\"Either they will jail him for a bribe and 'finish him off' in the [war] zone, or reclassify the charge as treason.\" Ivanov's stepson, whom he shared skiing trips with, is reportedly educated in Britain - despite the war against Ukraine.\n\nAnd have claimed a divorce seven months after the war started from his wife socialite ex-TV star Svetlana Zakharova [Maniovich] - fond of posing semi-nude in the Maldives - was a \"sham\" to protect from Western sanctions as she carried on a lavish life in Britain, France and other European countries.\n\nIvanov has played a key role in the destruction of Ukraine\n\nThe couple boasted 11 vehicles including Mercedes-Benz and Bentley cars, while Ivanov's daughter has an apartment in Mexico. Svetlana, 52, rents expensive villas in St Tropez and prefers to travel by Rolls-Royce, according to an expose by 'murdered' Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's team last year.\n\n\"We could not find any evidence of the reality of the breakup between [Svetlana] and Ivanov,\" said the team at the time. She \"radiates richness - diamonds, furs, Rolls Royces, she has it all and more.\n\n\"In summer you can find her in St Tropez where she rents a villa for \u20ac150k/month, or on a yacht in Naples... She loves shopping. Sadly, Moscow doesn't satisfy her fashion needs, so she has to travel to Paris.\n\n\"She gets personal appointments at one of the most expensive and discrete fine jewellery stores. This is where she gets \u20ac150K earrings and \u20ac104K rings made for her.\"\n\nShe and Ivanov the couple share two daughters - Praskovya, born in 2018, and Darya, born in 2010. Baza media outlet today reported that Svetlana was \"of interest to the investigation\" into alleged Ivanov corruption.\n\nThere are even unconfirmed claims she had been arrested - even though the couple are not believed to be together currently.\n\nMore recently rumours have surfaced that the womanising Ivanov is now romantically linked to with Shoigu's close former advisor Maria Kitaeva, another ex-TV presenter, born in Belgium and close to Putin.\n\nIn fact, Ivanov had taken Kitaeva who was married to his fellow deputy defence minister, Ukrainian-born Yuri Sadovenko. As the new relationship was sealed she bought Ivanov monogrammed pyjamas with the letters MK and TI. She had previously hosted the annual Direct Line with Putin TV question and answer extravaganza.\n\nIvanov has been sanctioned by the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Ukraine, Switzerland, and New Zealand since 2022 over Putin's invasion. The FSB has been probing Ivanov for five years, say reports. Searches are now underway in \"dozens\" of locations linked to him and his \"Batman\" Borodin who owns multiple companies.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"},

It comes as spending on the military has ballooned amid its offensive on Ukraine.\n\nIvanov, 48, oversaw construction and procurement for the armed forces, and was linked to Russia's high-profile rebuilding of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, occupied by Moscow's forces.\n\n\"The deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation was sent to a pre-trial detention centre,\" the press service for Moscow courthouses said in a statement on social media.\n\nHe faces up to 15 years in prison for bribe-taking \"on a particularly large scale\", it added.\n\nIvanov denies the charges, his lawyer told the state-run TASS news agency.\n\nSeveral independent Russian media outlets have alleged that Ivanov and his family acquired vast wealth through kick-backs on contracts he agreed at the ministry.\n\n- Lavish lifestyle -\n\nIn December 2022, Navalny's team said they had obtained thousands of leaked emails from Ivanov's wife, Svetlana Maniovich, that showed a lavish lifestyle well beyond what his official salary could cover.\n\nThey said she had spent hundreds of thousands of euros on luxury cars, jewellery, clothes, parties, and renting premium property and yachts in the south of France.\n\nSome of the transactions were routed through third parties, including defence ministry contractors, they alleged.\n\nThe Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin was in \"constant\" contact with Shoigu but refused to comment directly on Ivanov's arrest.\n\n\"There will be an investigation,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, cautioning against \"speculation\".\n\nIn court on Wednesday, Ivanov, 48, stood in a glass dock for defendants in military uniform.\n\nThe court said investigators believe he was part of a \"criminal conspiracy\" to take a \"bribe on a particularly large scale in the form of property services, during the course of contracting and subcontracting work for the defence ministry.\"\n\nIt did not provide further details.\n\nThe judge sent him to pre-trial detention until at least June 23. He will be held at the notorious Lefortovo jail in Moscow, TASS reported.\n\n- 'Shoigu's deputy' -\n\nCampaigners, including Navalny, have long argued that corruption is endemic in Putin's Russia.\n\nArrests of high-profile government figures are rare, usually the result of political infighting, analysts say.\n\nActivists say the vast sums being poured into the Ukraine offensive has given officials new opportunities to enrich themselves through secretive procurement deals.\n\nRussian military bloggers, who have long criticised Shoigu's handling of the offensive, quickly linked Ivanov to the defence minister on social media.\n\nIn a post criticising Ivanov, Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone repeatedly referred to him as \"Shoigu's Deputy\".\n\n\"He, like Shoigu, comes from the family clan,\" it said.\n\nFormer Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had accused Shoigu and other defence ministry officials of corruption and incompetence before his mysterious death last year.\n\nThe defence ministry has not commented on Ivanov's arrest.\n\nJust hours before investigators announced they had arrested Ivanov on Tuesday he had appeared in video footage published by the ministry in which Shoigu addressed top military brass about the state of the Ukraine offensive.\n\nbur/jj\n\nMore from this section\n\nKelly Auto Group Expands with Opening of Kelly Hyundai of

Sergey Borodin, a friend of Ivanov, has also been remanded in custody.\n\nIvanov's arrest was first reported on the evening of April 23. According to Russian state media, he will be held in Moscow's Lefortovo remand prison for the duration of the authorities' preliminary investigation. The Telegram channel 112 said that investigators have begun searching a dacha owned by Ivanov in Dagestan, while the channel VChK-OGPU reported that three other people have been arrested in connection with the case.\n\nKremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Wednesday evening that Vladimir Putin has been notified of Ivanov's arrest and that Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu was \"informed in advance.\" Ivanov is known to be a longtime ally of Shoigu, having served as his deputy governor in the Moscow region back in 2012.\n\nIvanov has overseen a wide range of construction projects as deputy defense minister, including the Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces, Moscow's Patriot Park theme park, and the reconstruction of occupied Mariupol. In 2019, he was included on Forbes Russia's list of the country's richest security officials.\n\nFollowing Ivanov's arrest, a source told Forbes that Ivanov is \"Shoigu's man\" but that he'd \"had some slip-ups\" and that \"questions had piled up\" around him. The source speculated that his arrest could be part of a \"purge\" of Shoigu's inner circle in preparation for the minister's possible departure from the defense ministry.\n\nIvanov has been the subject of a number of corruption investigations by journalists. In 2022, Team Navalny reported that the deputy minister's family owns multiple expensive properties in the Moscow region. Later that year, they reported that Ivanov's first wife had spent hundreds of thousands of euros on jewelry, clothing, and vacations over the years, with third-party individuals and companies regularly footing the bill.

He faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Fomin and Borodin on the matter.\n\nIvanov was a close ally of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who risks being damaged by the scandal. State news agency TASS quoted a source as saying that Shoigu had fired Ivanov since his arrest. TASS said investigators had seized all the bank accounts and property of Ivanov and his family.\n\nRIVALRIES\n\nSome analysts see the affair as an attempt to weaken Shoigu and a sign of tensions and rivalries in the elite as Putin prepares to name a new government next month after being re-elected in March for another six-year term.\n\nShoigu, however, is expected to keep his job. Under his direction, Russian forces have regrouped and regained the initiative in Ukraine and have recorded a series of gains in the past two months.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry, whose spending has spiralled since the war began.\n\nHe had long been the subject of journalistic investigations.\n\nRussia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, had alleged that Ivanov and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to the French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and a 19th century mansion in Moscow.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.

He faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Fomin and Borodin on the matter.\n\nIvanov was a close ally of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who risks being damaged by the scandal. State news agency TASS quoted a source as saying that Shoigu had fired Ivanov since his arrest. TASS said investigators had seized all the bank accounts and property of Ivanov and his family.\n\nRIVALRIES\n\nSome analysts see the affair as an attempt to weaken Shoigu and a sign of tensions and rivalries in the elite as Putin prepares to name a new government next month after being re-elected in March for another six-year term.\n\nShoigu, however, is expected to keep his job. Under his direction, Russian forces have regrouped and regained the initiative in Ukraine and have recorded a series of gains in the past two months.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry, whose spending has spiralled since the war began.\n\nHe had long been the subject of journalistic investigations.\n\nRussia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, had alleged that Ivanov and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to the French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and a 19th century mansion in Moscow.\n\nForbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures. Other investigations have alleged corruption in Russia's reconstruction of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol now controlled by Russian forces.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kickback (bribery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur_Ivanov", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timur Ivanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fomin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Fomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Borodin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Borodin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Borodin_(footballer,_born_1999)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Borodin (footballer, born 1999)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Shoigu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommersant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kommersant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KGB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Corruption_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Corruption Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Riviera"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariupol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mariupol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/17/1600x900/World_News_1713332107319_1713332146018.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506436", "eventUri": "eng-9506436", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 244, "textEnd": 252}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

He was also accused of bribery, and Timur Ivanov, who denied the charges, was detained by the Federal Security Service (FSB). His ex-wife was also arrested with him.\n\nProsecutors described the 48-year-old as part of a \"criminal conspiracy\" in which he received bribes \"on a particularly large scale\" during his role supervising military construction projects. Specifically, Ivanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was responsible for the Department of Real Estate, Housing, Construction and Mortgages at the Ministry of Defense, whose spending has risen significantly since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.\n\n{https://twitter.com/iEidiseisGR/status/1783104065238384947}\n\nAccording to Russian media, Ivanov, who is said to be responsible among other things for the reconstruction work of the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol, has amassed enormous wealth, created his own empire of luxury real estate and more. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in prison. Pictures of his lavish life had spread around the world in the past, and he - along with his wife - was the focus of numerous press inquiries about real estate, travel and expensive purchases from Europe. Forbes magazine ranked him among the richest men in the Russian security forces.\n\nThe late opposition leader Alexei Navalny had claimed, in an investigation conducted in 2022, that the official in question transferred millions of dollars to his wife, who spent exorbitant sums on luxury yachts, jewelry, and shopping in Paris. When the first allegations were published, Ivanov allegedly \"divorced\" his wife Svetlana, who later presented herself as a \"successful businesswoman\" and took Israeli citizenship. She even moved to the resort of Courchevel, an area for the wealthy in France, while in Russia she is said to have more than 100 companies to her name.\n\nUpon news of Ivanov's arrest, Maria Pevtsche, head of the anti-corruption fund founded by Navalny, wrote on social media that \"today is a good day.\"\n\nMany Russian bloggers, close to the Kremlin, and who have long accused high-ranking officials in the Russian military establishment of incompetence and corruption, were also pleased with this development. Ivanov was also targeted for his lavish lifestyle, which ran counter to what Putin said he did not want to see from his government officials. \"This is clearly a Teutonic change,\" said Yuri Podolyaka, one of the most famous pro-Russian military bloggers. \"And this is not about Ivanov...I hope this is just the beginning.\"\n\nThe yacht they had during their vacation in France\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, a close associate of Ivanov, had been warned of the impending arrest. Ivanov reportedly participated in meetings with Shoigu and other military officials the day before his imprisonment, and many see his arrest as indicative of a struggle within the Russian elite as well as a public statement of Putin's intentions to root out corruption plaguing Russia's armed military. Troops.\n\nKremlin leaks say Ivanov's arrest is the start of a major anti-corruption operation, based on evidence collected since 2019, and more mass removals and arrests are expected after May 7 and Putin's formal inauguration for his new term as president. According to information, Ivanov was scheduled to be arrested later, but it was accelerated due to the presence of his \"ex-wife\" in Moscow.\n\nWe also recall that last month Vladimir Putin ordered the Federal Security Service to root out corruption in state defense procurement. \"Let's just say that the investigation did not start yesterday, or the day before yesterday, or even a month ago,\" an unnamed source from Russian law enforcement agencies told the state-run TASS news agency. According to the same agency, the FSB's military counterintelligence service is also involved in the case.\n\nSvetlana is behind the wheel of one of the couple's Rolls Royce cars\n\nTimur Ivanov

He could face 15 years in prison.\n\nHis arrest has sparked speculation about whether it might signal a purge among the Moscow elite, especially given his close relationship with defense minister Sergei Shoigu, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\nThe independent Russian news outlet Real Stories said that the true reason for Ivanov's arrest was \"high treason,\" citing two sources close to the FSB.\n\n\"A bribe is for the public.

Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov was detained on Tuesday, according to a brief 22-word statement by Russia's investigative committee. The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale\".\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted. The sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia's post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu. Ivanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.\n\nRussia's Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement. The Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov's properties were being searched. State television gave the case full coverage.\n\n\"Lets just say the investigation did not start yesterday, the day before yesterday or even a month ago,\" an unidentified Russia law enforcement source told the TASS state news agency. FSB military counter-intelligence was involved, TASS said. It was not immediately clear why such a senior official with a close association with Shoigu would be targeted.\n\nRussian military bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army's hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion. Within the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties. In 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants. He rose through the ranks of Russia's state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region's government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defence ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and at high-security installations. Forbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Moscow's Basmanny Court has ordered that Russian Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov be remanded for two months while he is investigated for allegedly taking bribes.\n\nHis acquaintance, entrepreneur Sergey Borodin, whom investigators consider Ivanov's accomplice, was also arrested. TASS has gathered the key takeaways about the case.\n\n- Ivanov and Borodin are accused of taking large bribes (Russian Criminal Code Article 290, Part 6). According to the investigation, they \"criminally conspired with third parties\" in order to receive a bribe \"as providing monetized services when conducting contracted and subcontracted work\" for the Defense Ministry.\n\n- According to the investigation, Borodin is friends with Ivanov. A source in law enforcement agencies told TASS that his company was \"fulfilling defense contracts\" of the military agency.\n\n- No other details about the case were made available.\n\n- Commenting on reports that Ivanov is purportedly suspected of high treason, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov played these allegations down. \"All these deliberations are nothing more than speculations around this case.\"\n\n- Ivanov denies his guilt, attorney Denis Baluyev told TASS.\n\n- According to the lawyer, evidence of money being transferred to Ivanov as a bribe is non-existent. \"The money as the object of the bribe is simply absent.\"\n\n- Law enforcement agencies told TASS that Ivanov was detained at his workplace. On the morning of April 23 he was participating in a board meeting of the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\n- Peskov earlier told journalists that Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed on Ivanov's arrest while Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu was \"informed in advance.\"\n\n- During the investigation, Ivanov will be held in the Lefortovo pre-trial detention facility.\n\n- Ivanov was born in Moscow in 1975. In 1997, he graduated from the Lomonosov Moscow State University and in 2004 - from the International Academy of Marketing and Management. He holds an advanced degree in economics.\n\n- In 1999-2012, he worked in the fuel and energy sphere, in 2012, he was a deputy head of the government of the Moscow Region (when Shoigu was the regional governor).\n\n- In 2013-2016, Ivanov was the head of Oboronstroy, a company building housing for the military as well as socially significant and strategic military objects. In May 2016, he was appointed deputy defense minister with his responsibilities encompassing property management, troop accommodation, housing and medical support as well as state defense procurement and acquisition.\n\n- The last time the sitting deputy head of a Russian federal ministry was detained was in the summer of 2023. Then Maxim Parshin, deputy head of the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation, was arrested for allegedly taking a bribe. He was dismissed from his post soon thereafter.\n\n- In April 2023, Olga Yarilova, who served as deputy culture minister in 2018-2022, was arrested. She was suspected of embezzlement while implementing the Pushkin Card project which enables young people to visit cultural events free of charge.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur_Ivanov", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timur Ivanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Borodin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Borodin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal Code of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Shoigu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefortovo_Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lefortovo Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Pushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academic degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-media.tass.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20240424/1417777.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506436", "eventUri": "eng-9506436", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 252, "textEnd": 260}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 1711, "textEnd": 1719}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-05-", "textStart": 2608, "textEnd": 2616}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He has been one of the minister's 12 deputies since 2016.\n\nIn 2012, he was head of the government of the Moscow region, where Shoigu was governor at the time. Shoigu later took Ivanov with him when Shoigu was transferred to the Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe Kremlin said after the arrest that Shoigu had been informed of the move in advance.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur_Ivanov", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timur Ivanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mariupol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mariupol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Shoigu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_subjects_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal subjects of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Presse-Agentur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Presse-Agentur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/95976b592a8c5bd159c1f6321af8f8f2-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506436", "eventUri": "eng-9506436", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 16}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 232, "textEnd": 239}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Suspected of accepting bribes, the general faces charges for which he could be sentenced to a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. The Anti-Corruption Foundation of the dead opposition Aleksei Navalni had accused Ivanov in 2022 of benefiting from construction projects in the city of Mariupol, taken that year by Russian troops.\n\nThe Investigative Committee, which deals with major crimes, said the arrest had taken place on Tuesday night and that the bribery would be particularly large to justify him facing such a long sentence.\n\nNews of the arrest also reached the Kremlin. According to his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, Putin was informed. Defense Minister Serguei Xoig\u00fa was told of the arrest before it took place, he added.\n\nIvanov pleaded not guilty yesterday before the Basmanni District Court of Moscow, which decreed a two-month provisional prison sentence for him, which can be extended. \"The investigation believes that Ivanov was part of a criminal conspiracy with third parties, he teamed up with them to commit an organized group crime,\" the court's press service explained. Its aim was to receive \"properties and services on a particularly large scale during contracts and subcontract work for the Ministry of Defence\".\n\nTimur Ivanov was born 48 years ago in Moscow, he is one of Shoigu's 12 deputy ministers and in 2022 he was sanctioned by the United States and the European Union following the start of the \"special military operation\" against Ukraine.\n\nGraduated in Mathematics from Moscow State University (MGU), he made a career and rose in the atomic energy sector of Russia. He worked as an adviser to the Minister of Energy before being appointed deputy head of the administration of the Moscow province in 2012, when Xoigu was its governor. Before being appointed deputy defense minister almost eight years ago, he worked at the Russian military's fuel and energy industrial complex and ran a company building military housing.\n\nThe accusation against him is based on witnesses and the result of investigative operations carried out for quite some time by agents of the military counterintelligence of the FSB, a source explained to the Tass agency. According to the newspaper Izv\u00e9stia, in addition to the deputy minister, the agents also arrested several people involved in the transfer of money through a \"complex chain of intermediaries\".\n\nThe arrest of Timur Ivanov has raised rumors of infighting within the Russian elite, as well as the possibility that he may be charged with treason. Peskov dismissed the speculation and asked journalists to focus on official information.\n\nIn 2019 Forbes included Ivanov in the list of the richest men in the security forces of Russia.\n\nIn 2022, he was the subject of an investigation published by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, created by opposition leader Aleksei Navalni, who died in prison in February. According to this organization, banned in Russia after being accused of being an \"extremist\", Ivanov reviewed and benefited from construction projects in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which has been under Russian control since that year.\n\nThe foundation alleged that the military man's family lived a life of luxury that included yachts, helicopters, trips to the French Riviera, diamonds and a 19th-century mansion in Moscow.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The court service said Alexander Fomin, the co-founder of a construction company called Olimpsitistroy, was suspected of paying bribes to Ivanov, who was detained on Tuesday, and Sergei Borodin, a close associate of Ivanov who is also in custody.\n\nA third man has been detained in a bribery investigation centring on Deputy Russian Defence Minister Timur Ivanov, the Moscow court service said on Thursday. The widening scandal is the worst to hit the defence ministry since the start of the war in Ukraine, and has gripped the political and media establishment in the run-up to a government reshuffle that President Vladimir Putin is expected to announce next month.\n\nThe court service said Alexander Fomin, the co-founder of a construction company called Olimpsitistroy, was suspected of paying bribes to Ivanov, who was detained on Tuesday, and Sergei Borodin, a close associate of Ivanov who is also in custody. The court service said Fomin, \"being in a relationship of trust with Ivanov\", was suspected of providing free services to him, Borodin and others.\n\n\"Also, Fomin and other persons, acting as an organised group, contributed to Ivanov's receipt of a particularly large bribe in the form of the illegal provision of property-related services to him,\" it said. Business newspaper Kommersant said investigators suspected Ivanov of receiving kickbacks from Fomin in return for helping his company win contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIvanov, who maintains his innocence, was arrested at work on Tuesday by the Federal Security Service, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB. He faces 15 years in jail if convicted. There was no immediate comment from Fomin and Borodin on the matter.\n\nIvanov was a close ally of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who risks being damaged by the scandal. State news agency TASS quoted a source as saying that Shoigu had fired Ivanov since his arrest. TASS said investigators had seized all the bank accounts and property of Ivanov and his family. RIVALRIES\n\nSome analysts see the affair as an attempt to weaken Shoigu and a sign of tensions and rivalries in the elite as Putin prepares to name a new government next month after being re-elected in March for another six-year term. Shoigu, however, is expected to keep his job. Under his direction, Russian forces have regrouped and regained the initiative in Ukraine and have recorded a series of gains in the past two months.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry, whose spending has spiralled since the war began. He had long been the subject of journalistic investigations.\n\nRussia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, had alleged that Ivanov and his family lived a life of luxury including yachts, helicopters, visits to the French Riviera, purchases of diamonds and a 19th century mansion in Moscow. Forbes magazine listed Ivanov as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.

Ivanov has been charged with receiving an especially large bribe (Part 6 of Article 290 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, punishable by up to 15 years in prison). \"The investigation believes that Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties, previously forming an organized group to commit the crime of receiving a particularly substantial bribe in the form of services of a property nature during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense,\" said the joint press service of the courts.\n\nIvanov's alleged accomplice, Sergey Borodin, was also arrested and placed in pre-trial detention for the same two-month period.\n\nIvanov has not admitted his guilt, reports the news agency TASS citing sources in law enforcement.\n\nAccording to the Telegram channel Mash, the court did not specify the amount of damage, stating that investigators are still assessing it. TASS reports that Ivanov was apprehended on the evening of April 23 and that the deputy minister had long been under surveillance. The newspaper \"Izvestia\" reported that several other individuals were detained along with Ivanov.\n\nMeanwhile, the news outlet Important Stories, citing two sources close to the FSB, reported that the real reason behind Timur Ivanov's arrest may be suspicion of state treason. \"The bribe is just for show. They don't want to talk publicly about state treason yet -- it's a big scandal considering it involves a deputy minister of defense,\" one source said. Another asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"gave the order after being persuaded that the matter was indeed one of state treason,\" and that Ivanov \"would not have been detained just for corruption.\"\n\nAccording to \"Important Stories\" sources, the FSB's Department of Military Counter-Intelligence is managing the operational support of the case. \"They are deciding what to do with him: whether to convict him on the bribery charge and 'finish him off' in prison, or to reclassify the charge to one of state treason,\" one source stated.\n\nAssociates of Alexei Navalny published a comprehensive investigation into Timur Ivanov and his wife Svetlana Zakharova (Maniovich) in December 2022. Their data indicate that between 2010-2018, the couple rented villas on the French Riviera every summer, spending no less than 850 thousand euros on accommodations in Saint-Tropez. The investigation claimed that Ivanov received kickbacks from construction companies contracting for the Ministry of Defense and divorced his wife in June 2022 so she could avoid EU sanctions, as she continued to travel to the bloc even after Russia began its full-scale war against Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "uawire.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UAWire"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The statute that the investigators cited for his detention is for accepting bribes \u201con a particularly large scale\u201d.\n\nHe faces 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nThe sudden arrest of an ally of Shoigu, who Putin tasked with fighting the war in Ukraine, triggered speculation about a battle within the elite and of a public crackdown on the corruption which has plagued Russia\u2019s post-Soviet armed forces.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had been informed, and added that Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defence officials chaired by Shoigu.\n\nIvanov, who has served as deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages at the defence ministry. The defence ministry has made no comment.CIA tries to recruit double agents in Russia with new video\n\nRussia\u2019s Kommersant newspaper said that Ivanov, 48, was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the Soviet-era KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defence procurement.\n\nThe Izvestia newspaper said others had also been detained, though there was no official confirmation of that. The newspaper said Ivanov\u2019s properties were being searched.

bloggers have long accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, especially after the army\u2019s hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine after seriously overextending itself during the first days of the invasion.\n\nWithin the Russian elite, there are a range of views on the war, which has had touched off the worst breakdown in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nIvanov, who could not be reached as he was in detention, has long been linked to the ostentatious opulence which has characterised some sections of the post-Soviet Russian elite, including luxurious real estate and flashy parties.\n\nIn 2022, Russia\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle.\n\nIvanov, who was born in Moscow, graduated with a degree in mathematics from Moscow State University and completed a dissertation in the organisational models for the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nHe rose through the ranks of Russia\u2019s state atomic energy sector and worked as an adviser to the energy minister before moving to become the deputy head of Moscow region\u2019s government under Shoigu, who was then governor.\n\nFrom 2013, Ivanov headed a defence ministry construction company which builds housing for soldiers and at high-security

It comes as spending on the military has ballooned amid its offensive on Ukraine.\n\nMr. Ivanov, 48, oversaw construction and procurement for the armed forces, and was linked to Russia's high-profile rebuilding of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, occupied by Moscow's forces.\n\n\"The Deputy Defence Minister of the Russian Federation was sent to a pre-trial detention centre,\" the press service for Moscow courthouses said in a statement on social media.\n\nHe faces up to 15 years in prison for bribe-taking \"on a particularly large scale\", it added.\n\nMr. Ivanov denies the charges, his lawyer told the state-run TASS news agency.\n\nSeveral independent Russian media outlets have alleged that Mr. Ivanov and his family acquired vast wealth through kick-backs on contracts he agreed at the Ministry.\n\nLavish lifestyle\n\nIn December 2022, Navalny's team said they had obtained thousands of leaked emails from Mr. Ivanov's wife, Svetlana Maniovich, that showed a lavish lifestyle well beyond what his official salary could cover.\n\nThey said she had spent hundreds of thousands of euros on luxury cars, jewellery, clothes, parties, and renting premium property and yachts in the south of France.\n\nSome of the transactions were routed through third parties, including Defence Ministry contractors, they alleged.\n\nThe Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin was in \"constant\" contact with Mr. Shoigu but refused to comment directly on Mr. Ivanov's arrest.\n\n\"There will be an investigation,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, cautioning against \"speculation\".\n\nIn court on Wednesday, Mr. Ivanov, 48, stood in a glass dock for defendants in military uniform.\n\nThe court said investigators believe he was part of a \"criminal conspiracy\" to take a \"bribe on a particularly large scale in the form of property services, during the course of contracting and subcontracting work for the Defence Ministry.\"\n\nIt did not provide further details.\n\nThe judge sent him to pre-trial detention until at least June 23. He will be held at the notorious Lefortovo jail in Moscow, TASS reported.\n\n'Shoigu's deputy'\n\nCampaigners, including Navalny, have long argued that corruption is endemic in Putin's Russia.\n\nArrests of high-profile government figures are rare, usually the result of political infighting, analysts say.\n\nActivists say the vast sums being poured into the Ukraine offensive has given officials new opportunities to enrich themselves through secretive procurement deals.\n\nRussian military bloggers, who have long criticised Mr. Shoigu's handling of the offensive, quickly linked Mr. Ivanov to the Defence Minister on social media.\n\nIn a post criticising Mr. Ivanov, Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone repeatedly referred to him as \"Shoigu's Deputy\".\n\n\"He, like Shoigu, comes from the family clan,\" it said.\n\nFormer Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had accused Mr. Shoigu and other Defence Ministry officials of corruption and incompetence before his mysterious death last year.\n\nThe Defence Ministry has not commented on Mr. Ivanov's arrest.\n\nJust hours before investigators announced they had arrested Mr. Ivanov on Tuesday he had appeared in video footage published by the Ministry in which Mr. Shoigu addressed top military brass about the state of the Ukraine offensive.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType":

The ally of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was arrested Tuesday evening, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe committee gave no further information, apart from saying Ivanov is suspected of taking an especially large bribe -- an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Kremlin rejected some Russian media reports that Ivanov was suspected of treason.\n\nIvanov, 48, was sanctioned by both the United States and European Union in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to a court statement, investigators told the judge that Ivanov had conspired with third parties to receive a bribe in the form of unspecified property services \"during contracting and subcontracting work for the needs of the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nAn acquaintance of Ivanov's, identified as Sergei Borodin, also was arrested and ordered jailed pending an investigation and trial on the same charges, court officials said. Both men are to remain in custody until at least June 23.\n\nAccording to the Defense Ministry's website, Ivanov was appointed in 2016 by a presidential decree. He oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military, as well as construction projects.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRussia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin were informed of Ivanov's arrest, which comes as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds through its third year.\n\nPeskov dismissed Russian media reports that the corruption allegations against Ivanov were intended to obscure additional allegations of high treason.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlet reported that the bribery charges were intended to hide more serious charges of treason and avoid scandal, citing two unidentified sources close to the Federal Security Service, or FSB.\n\nPeskov described the reports as speculation. \"There are a lot of rumors. We need to rely on official information,\" he told journalists.\n\nIvanov's lawyer also denied any other charges, telling RIA Novosti that he faced only bribery allegations.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBefore his arrest, Ivanov was seen attending a meeting with Shoigu and other military brass.\n\nRussian media reported that he oversaw some of the construction in Mariupol -- a Ukrainian port city that was devastated by bombardment and occupied by Russian forces early in the war.\n\nZvezda, the official TV channel of the Russian military, reported in summer 2022 that the ministry was building an entire residential block in Mariupol and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites and newly erected residential buildings.\n\nThat same year, the team of the late Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner, alleged Ivanov and his family had been enjoying luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and owning elite real estate. The activists also alleged that Ivanov's wife, Svetlana, divorced him in 2022 to avoid sanctions and continued living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nCommenting on Ivanov's case, Navalny's ally Maria Pevchikh said on social platform X: \"It's a good day today.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe prosecution of high-level officials for corruption remains relatively rare in Russia.\n\nThe most recent arrest in April 2023 saw former Deputy Culture Minister Olga Yarilova charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles ($2.2 million). Yarilova, who held her post between 2018 and 2022, is on trial and facing a seven-year jail term.\n\nFormer Economics Minister Alexei Ulyukayev received an eight-year prison sentence in 2017 for accepting a $2 million bribe from one of Putin's top associates. The high-profile trial was widely seen as part of infighting between Kremlin clans. Ulyukayev, now 68, was granted early release from prison in May 2022.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thestar.com",

Alexei NIKOLSKY / POOL / AFP A Russian deputy defence minister who was exposed in an investigation by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny's team was remanded in custody Tuesday on suspicion of taking large bribes.\n\nThe arrest of Timur Ivanov, a long-time ally of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, is the most dramatic corruption case in Russia in recent years, and comes as spending on the military has ballooned amid its offensive on Ukraine.\n\nIvanov, 48, oversaw construction and procurement for the armed forces, and was linked to Russia's high-profile rebuilding of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, occupied by Moscow's forces.\n\n\"The deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation was sent to a pre-trial detention centre,\" the press service for Moscow courthouses said in a statement on social media.\n\nHe faces up to 15 years in prison for bribe-taking \"on a particularly large scale,\" it added.\n\nSeveral independent Russian media outlets have alleged that Ivanov and his family acquired vast wealth through kick-backs on contracts he agreed at the ministry.\n\nIn December 2022, Navalny's team said they had obtained thousands of leaked emails from Ivanov's wife, Svetlana Maniovich, that showed a lavish lifestyle well beyond what his official salary could cover.\n\nThey said she had spent hundreds of thousands of euros on luxury cars, jewellery, clothes, parties, and renting premium property and yachts in the south of France.\n\nSome of the transactions were routed through third parties, including defence ministry contractors, it alleged.\n\nIn court on Tuesday, Ivanov, 48, stood in a glass dock for defendants in military uniform.\n\nThe court said investigators believe he was part of a \"criminal conspiracy\" to take a \"bribe on a particularly large scale in the form of property services, during the course of contracting and subcontracting work for the defence ministry.\"\n\nIt did not provide further details.\n\nThe judge sent him to pre-trial detention until at least June 23. He will be held at the notorious Lefortovo jail in Moscow, the state-run TASS news agency reported.\n\nCampaigners, including Navalny, have long argued that corruption is endemic in President Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\nArrests of high-profile government figures are rare, usually the result of political infighting, analysts say.\n\nActivists say the vast sums being poured into the Ukraine offensive

Timur Ivanov is suspected of accepting a bribe of 1 million Rubles and faces up to 15 years in prison if he is convicted, CNN reported, citing TASS. A video released by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti showed him standing in a glass box in the courtroom in Moscow.\n\nThe US and European Union had imposed sanctions against Ivanov as he has been viewed as a senior architect of Russia's military action in Ukraine. The allegations make this a high-profile corruption case in Russia since the war between Moscow and Kyiv started in February 2022. Ivanov's responsibilities include reconstructing Russian-occupied Mariupol in Ukraine. He has been spotted inaugurating various construction projects in Mariupol, the report said.\n\nIn April 2023, late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's International Anti-Corruption Foundation's (ACF) chairperson Maria Pevchikh mentioned Timur Ivanov had \"one of the most lucrative jobs that one can have in the Ministry of Defence.\" Previously, the ACF alleged that Ivanov had earned a sizeable pay for leading construction for the Russian army. In 2023, Maria Pevchikh told CNN that Ivanov's wealth with assets including a historical house in one of Moscow's most expensive districts has been made by \"corruption.\" According to ACF, Ivanov, already a wealthy man, hugely benefited from the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Defence minister Sergei Shoigu had been informed in advance of his detention, he said.\n\nIvanov, 48, one of 12 deputy defence ministers, was sanctioned by both the US and the EU in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. He worked in companies dealing with fuel and energy and in the Moscow regional government before joining the defence ministry in 2010. He became a deputy minister in 2016.\n\nForbes magazine has listed him as one of the wealthiest men in Russia's security structures.\n\nNews outlet RBK posted a picture of him attending a meeting of ministerial officials earlier on Tuesday chaired by Shoigu.\n\nRussian news reports said Ivanov was likely the most senior Russian official to face such charges since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nHe was the subject of an investigation published in 2022 by the banned Anti-Corruption Foundation - created by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nIt said the deputy minister oversaw - and profited from - construction projects in Ukraine's Mariupol, which fell under Moscow's control after a months-long siege.\n\nAccording to the probe from the organisation, which has been banned in Russia for alleged \"extremism\", the minister divorced his wife to allow her to bypass EU sanctions.\n\n\"Today is a good day,\" Maria Pevchikh, the head of investigations at the foundation, said on social media.\n\nLike most high-profile opposition figures, Pevchikh was forced into exile by the Kremlin's repression.\n\nMost of the opposition remaining in Russia is behind

Shoigu -- received kickbacks from a construction firm in return for helping it win ministry contracts.\n\nAccording to an investigative committee, Mr. Ivanov has been charged with taking bribes in excess of one million rubles (approx. $10,800), a crime that carries a maximum jail sentence of 15 years.\n\nOn April 24, a Moscow court remanded Mr. Ivanov in custody for a two-month period, during which preliminary investigations will be conducted.\n\n\"Investigators believe the defendant entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties ... with a view to committing a crime,\" the court said in a statement.\n\nIt added that Mr. Ivanov stands accused of taking bribes \"as part of an organized group\" while overseeing contracted work for the defense ministry.\n\nDenis Baluyev, an attorney for Mr. Ivanov, has said there is no evidence of any bribe money having been transferred to his client.\n\n\"The money ... is simply absent,\" Mr. Baluyev was quoted as saying by TASS.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov played down reports that Mr. Ivanov could be charged with high treason in connection with the alleged offense.\n\nLast month, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the FSB to wage a \"systematic\" crackdown on state corruption, especially that pertaining to military procurement.\n\nAccording to judicial officials, two other people -- Sergey Borodin and Alexander Fomin -- have also since been detained in connection with the case.\n\nMr. Borodin, an entrepreneur and close associate of Mr. Ivanov, was detained by authorities on April 24.\n\nOn April 25, Mr. Fomin, co-founder of a prominent Russian construction firm, was also arrested and charged.\n\nBoth men reportedly stand accused of paying bribes to Mr. Ivanov, 48, who has held the post of deputy defense minister since 2016.\n\nThe court claims that Mr. Borodin served as Mr. Ivanov's \"accomplice\" in the suspected bribery scheme.\n\nIt has also accused Mr. Borodin of \"criminally conspiring with third parties.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Fomin -- along with unnamed \"other persons\" -- is accused of funneling bribes to Mr. Ivanov in the form of illicit \"property-related services.\"\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Fomin's company was awarded a large contract -- by Mr. Ivanov -- to build a string of medical centers, Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported this week.\n\nAs of press time, neither Mr. Fomin nor Mr. Borodin had issued statements regarding the charges against them.\n\nIt also comes shortly before a major cabinet reshuffle that Mr. Putin, who recently won a fresh term in office, is expected to announce next month.\n\nMr. Ivanov has long been regarded as a close ally of Gen. Shoigu, who some observers speculate could be hurt by the unfolding scandal.\n\nSome Kremlin watchers see the ongoing probe as an effort to damage Gen. Shoigu before Mr. Putin's anticipated cabinet reshuffle.\n\nThe 69-year-old general, however, is widely expected to maintain his post, despite the potentially damaging allegations.\n\nUnder his direction, Russian forces have largely regained the initiative in eastern Ukraine, where they have recently chalked up several notable gains.\n\nMr. Ivanov was appointed deputy defense minister in 2016 by presidential decree.\n\nAccording to the ministry's website, his responsibilities included overseeing property management, military housing, and construction projects.\n\nThe charges against a deputy minister are not without precedent.\n\nIn April of last year, Olga Yarilova, a former deputy culture minister, was arrested and charged with embezzling more than 200 million rubles (approx. $2.2 million).\n\nMs. Yarilova is now standing trial, where she faces a maximum seven-year jail sentence.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Previously, he worked as a deputy prime minister of the Moscow region and at Russian fuel and energy companies.\n\nIvanov oversaw construction-related issues at the Defense Ministry, where he was responsible for building the main temple of the armed forces - the Vostochny Cosmodrome.\n\nAfter the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he was placed in charge of the project to \"restore\" occupied Mariupol, which sustained extensive damage by the Russian Armed Forces.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kateryna_zakharchenko@kyivpost.com", "name": "Kateryna Zakharchenko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur_Ivanov", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timur Ivanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Shoigu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian ruble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostochny_Cosmodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vostochny Cosmodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint-stock company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariupol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mariupol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2024/04/24/060f4fa07e1076a14adcb09db1535127.jpg?w=630&q=90&f=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506436", "eventUri": "eng-9506436", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 154, "textEnd": 162}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 834, "textEnd": 842}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

If convicted, he faces 15 years in prison.\n\nIvanov will be held in custody in a pre-trial detention center until at least June 23, Moscow's court wrote on Telegram. His lawyer, Denis Baluyev, said he is appealing the case and requested that Ivanov be put under house arrest instead, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti.\n\nIvanov, who has been in his post since 2016, is seen as a senior architect of Russia's war in Ukraine and a close ally of Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu. Ivanov is still listed on the Defense Ministry website as a serving minister, and there are no reports of him being dismissed.\n\nThe unexpected arrest of an ally of Shoigu may again put pressure on the defense minister, who has been criticized for his handling of the invasion of Ukraine - most forcefully by the Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in the months before his death last year. Despite setbacks, Shoigu has been kept in his post by Putin.\n\nRussian investigative journalist Andrey Soldatov told CNN this aligns with a \"tactic\" used by the FSB, Russia's security service, where it arrests a high-ranking official in order to crack down on rule-breaking in the ministry, agency or organization as a whole.\n\n\"Now that deputy will be extensively interrogated, not only about himself, and is supposed to provide incriminating evidence... on big shots of the organization,\" Soldatov said.\n\nIvanov's responsibilities have included the reconstruction of Mairupol, a city in southern Ukraine reduced to ruin by Russian forces in a months-long siege at the outset of the war. The minister has frequently been seen cutting ribbons on various construction projects in the city - as Russia attempts to put a Potemkin facade on the city it destroyed.\n\nHis lavish lifestyle has earned him a reputation inside Russia and, with it, the scrutiny of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF). Maria Pevchikh, chair of the foundation, said Ivanov had \"one of the most lucrative jobs that one can have\" in Russia's Defense Ministry, and claimed the invasion of Ukraine has made him far richer.\n\nLast year, Pevchikh told CNN that Ivanov's wealth - with assets including a historic house in one of Moscow's most expensive districts - is funded by corruption. Russia's Defense Ministry did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nIvanov was sanctioned by the European Union and United States after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nBut his ex-wife, Svetlana Maniovich, has continued to live a life of European opulence: yachting on the Mediterranean, skiing in the Alps and living in Paris.\n\nIn an investigation last year, the ACF assembled a picture of a woman who has seemingly escaped all scrutiny for Ivanov's role in Ukraine, and the extreme profits he is alleged to have reaped. Drawing on a trove of 8,000 leaked emails, the investigation claimed that Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewlry store on the famed Place Vendrome in March 2022, while the siege of Mariupol was tightening.\n\nCNN's Clarissa Ward, Mick Krever and Clare Sebastian contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

A video released by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti showed him standing in a glass box in the courtroom in Moscow.\n\nThe US and European Union had imposed sanctions against Ivanov as he has been viewed as a senior architect of Russia's military action in Ukraine. The allegations make this a high-profile corruption case in Russia since the war between Moscow and Kyiv started in February 2022.\n\nIvanov's responsibilities include reconstructing Russian-occupied Mariupol in Ukraine. He has been spotted inaugurating various construction projects in Mariupol, the report said.\n\nIn April 2023, late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's International Anti-Corruption Foundation's (ACF) chairperson Maria Pevchikh mentioned Timur Ivanov had \"one of the most lucrative jobs that one can have in the Ministry of Defence.\"\n\nPreviously, the ACF alleged that Ivanov had earned a sizeable pay for leading construction for the Russian army. In 2023, Maria Pevchikh told CNN that Ivanov's wealth with assets including a historical house in one of Moscow's most expensive districts has been made by \"corruption.\" According to ACF, Ivanov, already a wealthy man, hugely benefited from the war between Russia and Ukraine.

now face 15 years in prison for accepting a \"hefty\" bribe - a criminal offence in Russia.\n\nIvanov, the top official in charge of the country's construction of military facilities, was detained by the Investigative Committee, Russia's top law enforcement agency.\n\nHe has been accused of taking a bribe of more than one million rubles (\u00a38,500), it is understood.\n\nKremlin spokesperson said that both Putin and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu were informed about the arrest.\n\nIvanov was sanctioned by both the US and the European Union in 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nHe was appointed to the post in 2016 by a presidential decree and oversaw property management, housing and medical support for the military.\n\nRussian media claimed that he was in charge of extensive construction in Mariupol - a port city in Ukraine's partially occupied Donetsk region which was heavily bombarded and occupied by Russian forces in 2022.\n\nRussian military previously reported that the ministry was building an entire residential block in the severely damaged city - and showed Ivanov inspecting construction sites.\n\nThat same year, the team of late Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's top critic, alleged that Ivanov and his family had been living an extravagant life full of luxurious trips abroad, lavish parties and elite real estate - indicating corruption.\n\nIvanov now joins the list of many such high-profile arrests in Putin's regime.\n\nLast year in December, the general in charge of Putin's feared \"Satan-2\" nukes was dramatically arrested in a fraud scandal that rocked Moscow.\n\nLieutenant General Oleg Frolov, 61, the deputy director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, was held along with two other alleged co-conspirators.\n\nHe was accused of playing a role in a play to steal \u00a34million from the Russian state - which is known to be rife with corruption.\n\nThe high-profile arrest comes after Russia scaled up its assault on Ukraine, hinting towards Putin's feared spring offensive that could start as early as next month.\n\nFor weeks, Putin's army has been pounding Ukraine with relentless waves of missile and drone strikes, terrorising its 1.3million residents and killing dozens.\n\nKharkiv's power facilities have been damaged particularly badly since Russia last month began targeting the critical civilian infrastructure, focusing on its energy system.\n\nOn March 22, Russian attacks destroyed the city's two main power plants and a network of substations, plunging it into darkness and leaving thousands without electricity.\n\nLast week, Kharkiv's mayor warned the frontline city is in danger of becoming a \"second Aleppo\" as Russian aerial attacks turn it into a wasteland.\n\nIhor Terekhov said that unless the West steps up and delivers crucial air defence systems, Kharkiv could suffer the same fate as the Syrian city, which heavy Russian bombing reduced to rubble a decade ago.\n\nHe begged for the West to step in and deliver crucial air defences.\n\nReferencing the now-passed US \u00a350billion aid bill, he told The Guardian: \"We need that support to prevent Kharkiv being a second Aleppo.\"\n\nDeliveries of US weapons are due to start within days after Republican congressmen finally ended a five-month deadlock in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe $61billion (\u00a349billion) package is due to get final approval from the US Senate today.\n\nZelensky said the new weapons would let Ukraine's forces \"stabilise the front line\".", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Many in Russia have long believed that he has enriched himself and his family through kickbacks from military contracts.\n\nHowever, citing sources within the FSB, the news outlet iStories has claimed that bribery charges may actually be serving as a cover story for a more serious investigation into treason.\n\n\"The bribery charges]are for the public.

in Moscow arrested on Thursday Russian businessman Alexandr Fomin on charges of bribing Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov.\n\nAt a hearing in Moscow, the Basmanny District Court ruled to arrest Fomin, the co-owner of Olimpsitistroy construction company, for 30 days.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the court ordered a ban on the use of real estate and assets, and the freezing of bank accounts owned by Ivanov and his relatives.\n\nOn Wednesday, the court arrested the deputy defense minister and Sergey Borodin, Ivanov's suspected associate in bribery.\n\nAccording to investigators, Borodin, being in friendly relations with Ivanov, who was supervising the construction and overhaul of Defense Ministry facilities, entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties to receive bribes.\n\nIvanov faces allegations of grand bribery that surpassed 1 million rubles ($10,700), which is considered \"particularly significant\" under Russian law and fraught with a potential prison sentence of up to 15 years.\n\nIvanov's lawyer Denis Baluyev said his client was detained at his workplace and pleaded not guilty, noting that \"money does not appear at all as the subject of a bribe.\"\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation, with Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu being forewarned about the impending detentions.\n\nHe declined to comment on reports alleging that Ivanov is also under suspicion of high treason, advising to await official statements regarding the matter.\n\nThe Russian state news agency TASS reported that Ivanov was removed from his post by Shoygu's order, citing a Defense Ministry source.\n\nBefore being appointed the deputy defense minister in May 2016, Ivanov worked in management positions in governmental

Kyiv has been pleading for more air defense systems and long-range missiles for months.\n\nIn other news, a Russian deputy defense minister, has been detained on suspicion of \"large-scale\" bribe-taking, marking one of the most high-profile corruption cases since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nRussia's top investigative body said late on Tuesday that Timur Ivanov had been taken into custody and an investigation into his case was taking place.\n\nRelief in Ukraine as U.S. Senate approves $61 billion aid package\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved a $61 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine on Tuesday night, paving the way for President Joe Biden to sign the legislation into law on Wednesday.\n\nThe overall package, which including aid for Israel and Taiwan is worth $95 billion, is a lifeline for Ukraine, whose forces have been running short on artillery and ammunition on parts of the front line. Kyiv has been pleading for more air defense systems and long-range missiles for months.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate was always expected to pass the aid package but it has taken months for it to be approved by the Republican-led House of Representatives amid opposition to ongoing aid for Ukraine. The bill finally received enough bipartisan support last Saturday, however, despite ongoing resistance from many Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe Pentagon has promised that supplies of weapons and equipment will reach Ukraine within days of Biden signing the bill into law.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the U.S., Kyiv's biggest backer, commenting on X Wednesday, \"I am grateful to the United States Senate for approving vital aid to Ukraine today ... This vote reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and the leader of the free world.\"\n\nZelenskyy said he looked forward to the bill being signed soon \"and the next military aid package matching the resoluteness that I always see in our negotiations.\"\n\n\"Ukraine's long-range capabilities, artillery, and air defense are critical tools for restoring just peace sooner,\" he said.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nRussian deputy defense minister detained on bribe allegations, officials say\n\nA Russian deputy defense minister in charge of military construction has been detained on Tuesday on suspicion of \"large-scale\" bribe-taking, in one of the highest-profile corruption cases since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine.\n\nA brief statement by the Investigative Committee, Russia's top investigative body, said late on Tuesday that Timur Ivanov had been taken into custody and an investigation into his case was proceeding.\n\nThe statute that the investigators cited for the detention of Ivanov, who has been in his job for eight years, is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale\".\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle filled with spending on real estate, luxurious trips and designer clothing.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov was in charge, among other things, of large construction projects rebuilding the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which was heavily bombarded and taken by Russia as part of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, quoted by Russian news agencies, said a report on Ivanov's detention had been presented to President Vladimir Putin. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu had been informed in advance of his detention, he said. Russian news reports said that Ivanov, if convicted, could face up to 15 years in prison.\n\nRussian news reports also said Ivanov was likely the most senior Russian official to face such charges since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nRussia is preparing 'unpleasant surprises' for summer offensive, commander says\n\nRussia is preparing \"unpleasant surprises\" in unexpected places when its forces launch an offensive in early summer, the commander of Ukraine's National Guard told a Ukrainian news agency.\n\nOleksandr Pivnenko echoed comments by other senior military officials, warning that Ukraine will face a difficult few months when the Russian offensive begins, with the launch expected in mid-May.\n\n\"Now they will not cause such problems that the commanders of the defense forces will run in panic and not know what to do. We are preparing,\" Pivnenko told Liga.net Tuesday.\n\n\"Yes, the enemy will make unpleasant surprises for us. He will act in directions that we do not expect. But he will not achieve his goal,\" he said.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last week gave one of the clearest indications yet that Russia intends to try to capture Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine when it launches its offensive. Pivnenko said any attempts to seize the city would cost Russia thousands of personnel.\n\n\"In order to capture Kharkiv, they [will] have to fight for years. Remember how long Bakhmut and Avdiivka held out. It is easier for the Russians to change the leadership of the Russian Federation and abandon their plans than to take the city by putting thousands more of their soldiers [into the fighting there],\" he said.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nIt could take weeks for Ukraine to receive U.S. weapons -- time it doesn't have\n\nA $61 billion U.S. military aid package for Ukraine is close to being approved by the U.S. Senate before being signed into law by President Joe Biden, but it could take weeks for supplies to reach Ukrainian forces on the frontline.\n\nA grateful Ukraine has urged officials to speed up the passage of the aid and the transfer of weapons, particularly long-range weapons systems including ATACMs (Army Tactical Missile Systems) and air defense systems, as Russia retains an advantage on the battlefield.\n\nAndrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at consultancy firm Teneo consultancy, commented that while the first shipments of military supplies are expected to reach Ukraine within days after the signing of the bill, it will likely take weeks to sufficiently replenish heavily-depleted Ukrainian forces across the more than 1,000km (621 mile) frontline.\n\n\"The Russian forces will likely attempt to exploit this period of vulnerability on the Ukrainian side and intensify offensive actions around the strategically important town of Chasiv Yar (west of Bakhmut),\" Tursa said in emailed comments.\n\n\"The occupation of Chasiv Yar would facilitate future Russian advances deeper into the Donetsk region and give Russian President Vladimir Putin an important victory during his inauguration on 7 May and Victory Day celebrations on 9 May,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have commented publicly that Russian forces are aiming to capture Chasiv Yar, which lies on high ground, given Russia a potential strategic advantage as it looks to fully occupy the wider Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's military said Monday that Russia has a force of 20,000-25,000 troops trying to storm Chasiv Yar and surrounding villages. Russian forces have claimed several advances in Donetsk in recent days, although Ukraine disputed claims on Monday that Russia had seized the village of Novomykhailivka.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nRussia will intensify attacks on Ukraine's Western weapons, defense minister says\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces will look to target storage bases containing Western weapons given to Ukraine.\n\n\"We will increase the intensity of attacks on logistics centers and storage bases for Western weapons,\" Shoigu said at a meeting of senior ministry officials Tuesday, news agency Interfax reported.\n\n\"The Russian Armed Forces will continue to carry out assigned tasks until the objectives of the special operation are fully achieved,\" he added. Despite more than two years of war with Ukraine, Russia continues to characterize its invasion of Ukraine as a \"special military operation.\"\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nUkraine suspends consular services for military-age men abroad\n\nUkraine has suspended consular services for military-age male citizens living abroad except for those needed to return to Ukraine, a government helpline said on Tuesday, in what appeared to be a measure to boost conscription for the war with Russia.\n\nUkraine is on the back foot on the battlefield facing a shortage of troops against a larger, better equipped foe nearly 26 months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement on X that he had ordered measures to be taken to restore what he described as \"fair treatment\" for men of mobilization age. He criticised those who had left Ukraine before or during the war.\n\n\"How it looks like now: a man of conscription age went abroad, showed his state that he does not care about its survival, and then comes and wants to receive services from this state,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not work this way. Our country is at war.\"\n\nHe said the foreign ministry would clarify the procedure for military-age men to obtain consular services soon. \"Staying abroad does not relieve a citizen of his or her duties to the homeland,\" he added.\n\nIn a separate statement, the state passport service said: \"Unfortunately, due to technical reasons, the issuance of ready-made documents in foreign branches of SE (State Enterprise) Document has been suspended.\"\n\nThe Eurostat database estimated about 4.3 million Ukrainians were registered in European Union countries as of January 2024 of whom about 20% are adult men, roughly 860,000 people.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nRussia warns it will retaliate if West seizes frozen assets\n\nA close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Tuesday that Russia is ready to retaliate if almost $300 billion of frozen Russian assets are seized by the West and used to assist Ukraine.\n\n\"The Europeans know that there will be a very tough response on our part, and an adequate response,\" Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, told state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nMatviyenko, a member of Russia's Security Council, said in an interview that a draft law on response measures had already been prepared. She did not specify what the retaliatory measures would be but said Europe \"will lose more than we do.\"\n\nWestern officials are not fully decided on the controversial proposal to seize frozen Russian assets abroad, the majority of which -- around $224 billion -- are in the European Union, a Russian lawmaker said Monday, noting that only $5 to $6 billion worth of assets were in the U.S.\n\nSupporters of the proposal say Russia needs to be punished for its invasion of Ukraine beyond sanctions on high-profile Russian individuals, entities and industries, and that Russian assets should be used to fund Ukraine's war effort and eventual multi-billion dollar reconstruction.\n\nCritics of the move warn that seizing Russian assets will only escalate tensions and create a dangerous precedent.\n\nThe Kremlin has thundered against the proposal, describing it as illegal and illegitimate. Some Russian officials have warned that Moscow could, in turn, confiscate Western assets if the proposal goes ahead.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"},

Russian businessman on charges of bribing deputy defense minister | News", "body": "Basmanny District Court in Moscow arrests co-owner of Olimpsitistroy construction company Aleksandr Fomin for 30 days\n\nA court in Moscow arrested on Thursday Russian businessman Alexandr Fomin on charges of bribing Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov.\n\nAt a hearing in Moscow, the Basmanny District Court ruled to arrest Fomin, the co-owner of Olimpsitistroy construction company, for 30 days.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the court ordered a ban on the use of real estate and assets, and the freezing of bank accounts owned by Ivanov and his relatives.\n\nOn Wednesday, the court arrested the deputy defense minister and Sergey Borodin, Ivanov's suspected associate in bribery.\n\nIvanov faces allegations of grand bribery that surpassed 1 million rubles ($10,700), which is considered \"particularly significant\" under Russian law and fraught with a potential prison sentence of up to 15 years.\n\nIvanov's lawyer Denis Baluyev said his client was detained at his workplace and pleaded not guilty, noting that \"money does not appear at all as the subject of a bribe.\"\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation, with Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu being forewarned about the impending detentions.\n\nHe declined to comment on reports alleging that Ivanov is also under suspicion of high treason, advising to await official statements regarding the matter.\n\nThe Russian state news agency TASS reported that Ivanov was removed from his post by Shoygu's order, citing a Defense Ministry source.\n\nBefore being appointed the deputy defense minister in May 2016, Ivanov worked in management positions in governmental bodies and state companies.",

Clad in full military attire, Ivanov appeared before a Moscow court on Wednesday, contained within a glass enclosure. He faces charges of receiving a bribe in conjunction with an organized group while executing contracted duties for the Defense Ministry, with a potential penalty of up to 15 years' imprisonment if convicted.\n\nHere is what you need to know\n\nHaving held his post since 2016, Ivanov is recognized as a key strategist behind Russia's actions in Ukraine and is closely aligned with Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu. The arrest of Ivanov, an ally of Shoigu, could potentially add pressure on the defense minister, who has faced criticism for his management of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nIvanov's duties have notably included overseeing the reconstruction efforts in Mariupol, a city in southern Ukraine severely damaged during the conflict. Ivanov's lavish lifestyle has attracted scrutiny, particularly from Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF). Maria Pevchikh, chair of the ACF, remarked on Ivanov's significant wealth accumulation during his tenure, particularly amidst the Ukraine invasion.\n\nIvanov's ex-wife has attracted attention as well\n\nAccording to a report from CNN news, while Ivanov faces legal consequences, his ex-wife, Svetlana Maniovich, continues to lead a life of luxury, enjoying yachting excursions in the Mediterranean, skiing trips in the Alps, and residing in Paris. The ACF's investigation into Maniovich's activities, based on leaked emails, highlighted her extravagant spending, including a reported $100,000 spree at a prestigious Parisian jewelry store during the tightening siege of Mariupol in March 2022.\n\nIvanov's arrest comes amid ongoing international sanctions against Russia, with both the European Union and United States imposing measures following the Ukraine invasion.

Kyiv has been pleading for more air defense systems and long-range missiles for months.\n\nIn other news, a Russian deputy defense minister, has been detained on suspicion of \"large-scale\" bribe-taking, marking one of the most high-profile corruption cases since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nRussia's top investigative body said late on Tuesday that Timur Ivanov had been taken into custody and an investigation into his case was taking place.\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved a $61 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine on Tuesday night, paving the way for President Joe Biden to sign the legislation into law on Wednesday.\n\nThe overall package, which including aid for Israel and Taiwan is worth $95 billion, is a lifeline for Ukraine, whose forces have been running short on artillery and ammunition on parts of the front line. Kyiv has been pleading for more air defense systems and long-range missiles for months.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled Senate was always expected to pass the aid package but it has taken months for it to be approved by the Republican-led House of Representatives amid opposition to ongoing aid for Ukraine. The bill finally received enough bipartisan support last Saturday, however, despite ongoing resistance from many Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe Pentagon has promised that supplies of weapons and equipment will reach Ukraine within days of Biden signing the bill into law.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the U.S., Kyiv's biggest backer, commenting on X Wednesday, \"I am grateful to the United States Senate for approving vital aid to Ukraine today ... This vote reinforces America's role as a beacon of democracy and the leader of the free world.\"\n\nZelenskyy said he looked forward to the bill being signed soon \"and the next military aid package matching the resoluteness that I always see in our negotiations.\"\n\n\"Ukraine's long-range capabilities, artillery, and air defense are critical tools for restoring just peace sooner,\" he said.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nA Russian deputy defense minister in charge of military construction has been detained on Tuesday on suspicion of \"large-scale\" bribe-taking, in one of the highest-profile corruption cases since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine.\n\nA brief statement by the Investigative Committee, Russia's top investigative body, said late on Tuesday that Timur Ivanov had been taken into custody and an investigation into his case was proceeding.\n\nThe statute that the investigators cited for the detention of Ivanov, who has been in his job for eight years, is for accepting bribes \"on a particularly large scale\".\n\nIn 2022, Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation, headed by the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, alleged that Ivanov and his family led a lavish lifestyle filled with spending on real estate, luxurious trips and designer clothing.\n\nRussian media reported that Ivanov was in charge, among other things, of large construction projects rebuilding the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which was heavily bombarded and taken by Russia as part of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, quoted by Russian news agencies, said a report on Ivanov's detention had been presented to President Vladimir Putin. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu had been informed in advance of his detention, he said. Russian news reports said that Ivanov, if convicted, could face up to 15 years in prison.\n\nRussian news reports also said Ivanov was likely the most senior Russian official to face such charges since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nRussia is preparing \"unpleasant surprises\" in unexpected places when its forces launch an offensive in early summer, the commander of Ukraine's National Guard told a Ukrainian news agency.\n\nOleksandr Pivnenko echoed comments by other senior military officials, warning that Ukraine will face a difficult few months when the Russian offensive begins, with the launch expected in mid-May.\n\n\"Now they will not cause such problems that the commanders of the defense forces will run in panic and not know what to do. We are preparing,\" Pivnenko told Liga.net Tuesday.\n\n\"Yes, the enemy will make unpleasant surprises for us. He will act in directions that we do not expect. But he will not achieve his goal,\" he said.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last week gave one of the clearest indications yet that Russia intends to try to capture Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine when it launches its offensive. Pivnenko said any attempts to seize the city would cost Russia thousands of personnel.\n\n\"In order to capture Kharkiv, they [will] have to fight for years. Remember how long Bakhmut and Avdiivka held out. It is easier for the Russians to change the leadership of the Russian Federation and abandon their plans than to take the city by putting thousands more of their soldiers [into the fighting there],\" he said.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nA $61 billion U.S. military aid package for Ukraine is close to being approved by the U.S. Senate before being signed into law by President Joe Biden, but it could take weeks for supplies to reach Ukrainian forces on the frontline.\n\nA grateful Ukraine has urged officials to speed up the passage of the aid and the transfer of weapons, particularly long-range weapons systems including ATACMs (Army Tactical Missile Systems) and air defense systems, as Russia retains an advantage on the battlefield.\n\nAndrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at consultancy firm Teneo consultancy, commented that while the first shipments of military supplies are expected to reach Ukraine within days after the signing of the bill, it will likely take weeks to sufficiently replenish heavily-depleted Ukrainian forces across the more than 1,000km (621 mile) frontline.\n\n\"The Russian forces will likely attempt to exploit this period of vulnerability on the Ukrainian side and intensify offensive actions around the strategically important town of Chasiv Yar (west of Bakhmut),\" Tursa said in emailed comments.\n\n\"The occupation of Chasiv Yar would facilitate future Russian advances deeper into the Donetsk region and give Russian President Vladimir Putin an important victory during his inauguration on 7 May and Victory Day celebrations on 9 May,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have commented publicly that Russian forces are aiming to capture Chasiv Yar, which lies on high ground, given Russia a potential strategic advantage as it looks to fully occupy the wider Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's military said Monday that Russia has a force of 20,000-25,000 troops trying to storm Chasiv Yar and surrounding villages. Russian forces have claimed several advances in Donetsk in recent days, although Ukraine disputed claims on Monday that Russia had seized the village of Novomykhailivka.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces will look to target storage bases containing Western weapons given to Ukraine.\n\n\"We will increase the intensity of attacks on logistics centers and storage bases for Western weapons,\" Shoigu said at a meeting of senior ministry officials Tuesday, news agency Interfax reported.\n\n\"The Russian Armed Forces will continue to carry out assigned tasks until the objectives of the special operation are fully achieved,\" he added. Despite more than two years of war with Ukraine, Russia continues to characterize its invasion of Ukraine as a \"special military operation.\"\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt\n\nUkraine has suspended consular services for military-age male citizens living abroad except for those needed to return to Ukraine, a government helpline said on Tuesday, in what appeared to be a measure to boost conscription for the war with Russia.\n\nUkraine is on the back foot on the battlefield facing a shortage of troops against a larger, better equipped foe nearly 26 months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a statement on X that he had ordered measures to be taken to restore what he described as \"fair treatment\" for men of mobilization age. He criticised those who had left Ukraine before or during the war.\n\n\"How it looks like now: a man of conscription age went abroad, showed his state that he does not care about its survival, and then comes and wants to receive services from this state,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not work this way. Our country is at war.\"\n\nHe said the foreign ministry would clarify the procedure for military-age men to obtain consular services soon. \"Staying abroad does not relieve a citizen of his or her duties to the homeland,\" he added.\n\nIn a separate statement, the state passport service said: \"Unfortunately, due to technical reasons, the issuance of ready-made documents in foreign branches of SE (State Enterprise) Document has been suspended.\"\n\nThe Eurostat database estimated about 4.3 million Ukrainians were registered in European Union countries as of January 2024 of whom about 20% are adult men, roughly 860,000 people.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nA close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Tuesday that Russia is ready to retaliate if almost $300 billion of frozen Russian assets are seized by the West and used to assist Ukraine.\n\n\"The Europeans know that there will be a very tough response on our part, and an adequate response,\" Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, told state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nMatviyenko, a member of Russia's Security Council, said in an interview that a draft law on response measures had already been prepared. She did not specify what the retaliatory measures would be but said Europe \"will lose more than we do.\"\n\nWestern officials are not fully decided on the controversial proposal to seize frozen Russian assets abroad, the majority of which -- around $224 billion -- are in the European Union, a Russian lawmaker said Monday, noting that only $5 to $6 billion worth of assets were in the U.S.\n\nSupporters of the proposal say Russia needs to be punished for its invasion of Ukraine beyond sanctions on high-profile Russian individuals, entities and industries, and that Russian assets should be used to fund Ukraine's war effort and eventual multi-billion dollar reconstruction.\n\nCritics of the move warn that seizing Russian assets will only escalate tensions and create a dangerous precedent.\n\nThe Kremlin has thundered against the proposal, describing it as illegal and illegitimate. Some Russian officials have warned that Moscow could, in turn, confiscate Western assets if the proposal goes ahead.\n\n-- Holly Ellyatt", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

spending on the military has ballooned amid its offensive on Ukraine.\n\nIvanov, 48, oversaw construction and procurement for the Armed Forces, and was linked to Russia's high-profile rebuilding of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, occupied by Moscow's forces.\n\n\"The deputy defense minister of the Russian Federation was sent to a pre-trial detention center,\" the press service for Moscow

alleged that Ivanov and his family acquired vast wealth through kick-backs on contracts he agreed at the ministry.\n\nIn December 2022, Navalny's team said they had obtained thousands of leaked emails from Ivanov's wife, Svetlana Maniovich, that showed a lavish lifestyle well beyond what his official salary could cover.\n\nThey said she had spent hundreds of thousands of euros on luxury cars, jewelry, clothes, parties, and renting premium property and yachts in the south of France.\n\nSome of the transactions were routed through third parties, including Defense Ministry contractors, it

It represents a final warning to Shoigu to improve the ministry's wartime performance though he's unlikely to be ousted at this time, one of the people said.\n\nStill, the case against Ivanov, who was the focus of a corruption investigation by the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny's team early in Russia's war on Ukraine, is a severe blow to Shoigu's authority, people close to the Defense Ministry and Russian intelligence services said, asking not to be identified because the issue is sensitive.\n\nThe scandal has erupted ahead of Putin's May 7 inauguration for a fifth term as president, with Russia's war in Ukraine in its third year and showing no sign of ending. The US is preparing to resume the flow of arms deliveries to Ukraine after Congress approved $61 billion in aid delayed for six months by domestic political divisions.\n\nPutin may carry out a significant government shake-up for the first time since 2020 following his inauguration. Shoigu, who's been defense minister since 2012, has faced criticism for his handling of the invasion of Ukraine, most vividly from the late Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a mutiny last June to try to oust him and army chief Valery Gerasimov.\n\nStill, Russia has lately been making limited, local advances along the frontline as Ukrainian forces wrestle with shortages of weapons and manpower, along with a dire need for more air defense systems. Shoigu threatened this week to intensify missile and drone attacks on Ukraine in response to the US decision to supply more weapons to its ally.\n\nMoscow's Basmanny Court on Wednesday ordered Ivanov held in custody for two months while investigations continue. Russia's Investigative Committee announced the deputy minister's detention late Tuesday in Moscow on accusations of accepting an \"especially large\" bribe exceeding 1 million rubles ($11,000).\n\nIvanov denies the bribery allegation, the Interfax news service reported, citing a person familiar that it didn't identify. He faces as much as 15 years in jail if convicted.\n\nIvanov, one of 12 deputy defense ministers, has been in post since May 2016. He's seen as the second closest deputy to Shoigu, some of the people familiar said. He's under US and European Union sanctions for his role in Russia's war in Ukraine, and is responsible for property management and infrastructure projects at the Defense Ministry.\n\nNavalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation in 2022 accused Ivanov of profiting from construction projects in the occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol.\n\nThe deputy minister's detention indicates \"a really serious weakening of Shoigu,\" said Nikolay Petrov, a visiting fellow at the Berlin-based SWP think tank. Amid an intensifying struggle for position within Russia's elite, the arrest \"would not have happened without Putin's permission,\" he said.\n\nTo be sure, Shoigu, 68, is among Putin's closest allies. He has bonded with the president over decades in government, accompanying him on highly publicized hunting and horse-riding trips in the Siberian wilderness in a sign of his privileged position in the inner circle.\n\nRead more: Putin's Hunting Pal Is at the Center of Kremlin Caterer's Mutiny\n\n\"The authorities are showing that they're purging themselves of bribe-takers,\" and indicating that the elite must show strict discipline during the confrontation with the West, said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Moscow. \"I don't think this weakens Shoigu. This arrest is hardly noticed by the 'masses,'\" he said.\n\nMinisters, including Shoigu himself, have carried on successful careers after the arrest of close allies. In 2006, one of Shoigu's deputies in the Emergencies Ministry was sentenced to 20 years in prison for organizing a criminal gang involved in extortion and racketeering.", "source": {"uri":

If convicted, he faces 15 years in prison.\n\nIvanov, who has been in his post since 2016, is seen as a senior architect of Russia's war in Ukraine and a close ally of Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu.\n\nThe unexpected arrest of an ally of Shoigu may again put pressure on the defense minister, who has been criticized for his handling of the invasion of Ukraine - most forcefully by the Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in the months before his death last year. Despite setbacks, Shoigu has been kept in his post by Putin.\n\nIvanov's responsibilities have included the reconstruction of Mairupol, a city in southern Ukraine reduced to ruin by Russian forces in a months-long siege at the outset of the war. The minister has frequently been seen cutting ribbons on various construction projects in the city - as Russia attempts to put a Potemkin facade on the city it destroyed.\n\nHis lavish lifestyle has earned him a reputation inside Russia and, with it, the scrutiny of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF). Maria Pevchikh, chair of the foundation, said Ivanov had \"one of the most lucrative jobs that one can have\" in Russia's Defense Ministry, and claimed the invasion of Ukraine has made him far richer.\n\nLast year, Pevchikh told CNN that Ivanov's wealth - with assets including a historic house in one of Moscow's most expensive districts - is funded by corruption. Russia's Defense Ministry did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nIvanov was sanctioned by the European Union and United States after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nBut his ex-wife, Svetlana Maniovich, has continued to live a life of European opulence: yachting on the Mediterranean, skiing in the Alps and living in Paris.\n\nIn an investigation last year, the ACF assembled a picture of a woman who has seemingly escaped all scrutiny for Ivanov's role in Ukraine, and the extreme profits he is alleged to have reaped. Drawing on a trove of 8,000 leaked emails, the investigation claimed that Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewlry store on the famed Place Vendrome in March 2022, while the siege of Mariupol was tightening.\n\nCNN's Clarissa Ward and Mick Krever contributed reporting.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

If convicted, he faces 15 years in prison.\n\nIvanov, who has been in his post since 2016, is seen as a senior architect of Russia's war in Ukraine and a close ally of Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu.\n\nThe unexpected arrest of an ally of Shoigu may again put pressure on the defense minister, who has been criticized for his handling of the invasion of Ukraine - most forcefully by the Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in the months before his death last year. Despite setbacks, Shoigu has been kept in his post by Putin.\n\nIvanov's responsibilities have included the reconstruction of Mairupol, a city in southern Ukraine reduced to ruin by Russian forces in a months-long siege at the outset of the war. The minister has frequently been seen cutting ribbons on various construction projects in the city - as Russia attempts to put a Potemkin facade on the city it destroyed.\n\nHis lavish lifestyle has earned him a reputation inside Russia and, with it, the scrutiny of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF). Maria Pevchikh, chair of the foundation, said Ivanov had \"one of the most lucrative jobs that one can have\" in Russia's Defense Ministry, and claimed the invasion of Ukraine has made him far richer.\n\nLast year, Pevchikh told CNN that Ivanov's wealth - with assets including a historic house in one of Moscow's most expensive districts - is funded by corruption. Russia's Defense Ministry did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nIvanov was sanctioned by the European Union and United States after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nBut his ex-wife, Svetlana Maniovich, has continued to live a life of European opulence: yachting on the Mediterranean, skiing in the Alps and living in Paris.\n\nIn an investigation last year, the ACF assembled a picture of a woman who has seemingly escaped all scrutiny for Ivanov's role in Ukraine, and the extreme profits he is alleged to have reaped. Drawing on a trove of 8,000 leaked emails, the investigation claimed that Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewlry store on the famed Place Vendrome in March 2022, while the siege of Mariupol was tightening.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Hours earlier, reports emerged of Ivanov's arrest on accusations that he had been taking bribes on what a Moscow court called \"a particularly large scale.\" He could face 15 years in prison.\n\nPrior to the arrest, Ivanov was in charge of Russian military infrastructure projects. Perhaps more importantly, he was widely seen as one of Shoigu's closest allies. The two men had worked together for many years, including when Ivanov served as deputy prime minister of the Moscow region while Shoigu was the area's governor.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense on Wednesday via email for comment.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied early reports that Ivanov's arrest was related to treason, but not everyone is convinced about Russia's official line regarding Ivanov's detention.\n\n\"Since corruption among top Russian officials is endemic, it's hard to believe that the arrest of Shoigu's deputy is just about corruption,\" George Mason University Schar School of Policy and Government professor Mark N. Katz told Newsweek.\n\nHe continued, \"Either he has done something else that someone opposed, or it is a move aimed at weakening Shoigu -- or both.\"\n\nShoigu has frequently been blamed for Russia's shortcomings on the battlefield in Ukraine, including by former Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who perished in a plane crash under mysterious circumstances after leading a mutiny against Moscow. Katz said the incident reminded him of the public feud between Shoigu and Prigozhin.\n\n\"The arrest harkens back to Prigozhin's criticism last year of incompetence within the top Russian military leadership. Prigozhin is gone, but the problems he publicized remain,\" Katz said.\n\n\"The real issue is not whether the deputy minister is corrupt. It is instead whether he, and -- more to the point -- Shoigu, have become centers of power in their own right,\" William Reno, professor and chair of the political science department at Northwestern University, told Newsweek.\n\n\"Corruption in the current regime is a strategic asset that's tolerated and even encouraged to cultivate a person's loyalty and dependence on the political leadership and then used against them when they become a threat or need to be used as a convenient target of blame for the regime's shortcomings,\" Reno said. \"Charging him with corruption at this juncture helps to undermine public trust and support for his boss, Shoigu.\n\n\"Charging a high official with corruption also highlights Putin's sovereign right as leader to punish, reinforcing his authority among his subordinates and in the eyes of Russian citizens.\"\n\nIvanov's arrest may just be the beginning of what's to come for Shoigu, according to Silbey.\n\n\"Remember that being 'too powerful' isn't a deterrent to Putin (or any dictator) taking someone out, it's an incentive,\" he said. \"The more powerful someone is, the more they're an existential threat to the dictator. Joseph Stalin's golden rule was 'do unto others before they do it to you.'\"\n\n\"It would not surprise if Shoigu is next or retires suddenly,\" Silbey added.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

According to the relevant clause in the Russian penal code cited by the Committee, such bribes involve sums of at least one million rubles (over $10,500). If found guilty, Ivanov could face up to 15 years behind bars.

Ivanov, one of Shoigu's closest allies, was detained on charges of accepting bribes on a particularly large scale, as reported by a Moscow court.This event led to his immediate removal from his position by Shoigu, following a directive from Kremlin-controlled news agency TASS.\n\nDavid Silbey, an associate professor of history at Cornell University, interpreted the arrest as a significant signal from Putin to Shoigu, suggesting, \"Putin doesn't sign off on that [arrest] unless he's sending a message to Shoigu, one that reads something along the lines of 'that could have been you.'\"\n\nAs per a Newsweek report, the ramifications of Ivanov's arrest extend beyond his individual actions. Analysts speculate it could be part of a broader strategy to weaken Shoigu's position or signal discontent with his performance. Shoigu has been under scrutiny for Russia's military performance in Ukraine, particularly from figures like the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, former leader of the Wagner Group, who openly criticized the Russian military leadership before his death in a plane crash.\n\nMark N Katz, a professor at George Mason University, expressed skepticism about the official reasoning behind the arrest, stating, \"Since corruption among top Russian officials is endemic, it's hard to believe that the arrest of Shoigu's deputy is just about corruption.\"\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about internal power dynamics within Russia's political and military elite. William Reno, a political science professor at Northwestern University, pointed out that corruption charges are often used strategically within the regime to manage loyalty and authority, and in this case, might be used to undermine Shoigu's standing and strengthen Putin's control.\n\nExperts like Silbey suggest that this might only be the beginning of a larger shake-up, indicating the potential vulnerability of even high-ranking officials like Shoigu under Putin's regime.

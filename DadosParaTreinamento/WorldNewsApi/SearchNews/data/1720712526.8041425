{"id": 232041370, "title": "Biden visits a military cemetery that Trump reportedly said was 'filled with losers'", "text": "BELLAU, France \u2014 President Biden on Sunday paid tribute to fallen U.S. Marines at an American cemetery outside of Paris, a resting place that features prominently in his case against former President Donald Trump. More than 2,200 Americans who fought and died in World War I are buried in the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery. \"Every Marine I know, knows about the Battle of Bellau Woods,\" Biden told reporters after a short wreath-laying ceremony. \"More Marines were lost here than any battle until the middle of World War II. The idea that I come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to pay tribute...\" Biden said. Trump had been scheduled to visit the cemetery in Nov. 2018, on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. But he scrapped those plans. The White House blamed the weather, saying it was too rainy for helicopters to fly, and arguing that a motorcade would have been too disruptive for traffic and the schedule. A different and much more damning story emerged two years later in The Atlantic, one that Biden often highlights on the campaign trail to show that his predecessor is not fit to be commander in chief. What The Atlantic said happened with Trump The Atlantic said Trump canceled the trip because he didn\u2019t want to get his hair wet in the rain, telling senior staff members \u201c\u2018Why should I go to that cemetery? It\u2019s filled with losers.\u2019\u201d The magazine said that Trump separately referred to Marines who lost their lives in the Battle of Belleau Wood as \u201c\u2018suckers\u2019 for getting killed.\u201d At the time the article came out, the Trump campaign strongly disputed its claims. Last year, Trump\u2019s then-chief of staff John Kelly confirmed much of it in an on-the-record statement to CNN \u2013 a statement that the Trump campaign described as \u201cdebunked stories.\u201d Kelly last week told NPR that Trump declined to go to the cemetery, so Kelly went with then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford. A photo of Kelly\u2019s visit is on the cemetery website: it was overcast, but no umbrellas were visible. How Biden uses this story in his campaign At a recent campaign stop in Scranton, Penn., Biden brought up Trump\u2019s snub of the Aisne-Marne cemetery. \u201cI have to say, there are a lot of things that Donald Trump has said and done that I find extremely offensive. But one that offends me the most is when he refused, as president, to visit an American cemetery outside of Paris when he was president,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe said that those soldiers who gave their lives were, quote -- it was his quote -- \u2018suckers\u2019 and \u2018losers,\u2019\u201d Biden said. Over applause, Biden shouted: \u201cWho does he think he is? These were heroes.\u201d Biden brings it up regularly, as he did at a fundraiser in New York earlier this week. \u201cThis guy does not deserve to be president, whether or not I was running,\u201d Biden said. What Biden said \u2014 and didn't say \u2014 about the politics of this stop At Aisne-Marne, Biden did not name-check Trump, and he pointedly did not answer a question about what message he was trying to send to voters by visiting the cemetery. Biden has staked his campaign on protecting democracy and freedom \u2013 two themes that came up a lot during his official visit to France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when U.S. and allied troops pushed into France in a battle that led to the end of World War II. He told reporters on Sunday that he hoped Americans would take away from his trip \"the knowledge that the best way to avoid these kinds of battles in the future is to stay strong with our allies.\" \"Do not break,\" he said. \"Do not break.\"", "summary": "The Aisne-Marne WWI cemetery in France has become a staple in President Biden's political speeches, used to paint an unflattering picture of former President Donald Trump.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2024/06/05/nx-s1-4993699/biden-trump-aisne-marne-cemetery-losers-suckers", "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8256x4644+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2F24%2F1cd837be48b9bbc4f38a945758f0%2Fgettyimages-2156175693.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:18:23", "author": "Tamara Keith", "authors": ["Tamara Keith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.608}

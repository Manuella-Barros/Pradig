The \u201cAny Man of Mine\u201d singer, 58, revealed that she\u2019s forgiven her ex-husband Robert \u201cMutt\u201d Lange for having an affair with her close friend Marie-Anne Thi\u00e9baud in 2008. \u201cForgiveness is in the family of letting go,\u201d Twain said on the Great Company with Jamie Laing podcast on May 28. \u201cBut forgiveness, more specifically for me anyway, is not about forgetting necessarily.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding the other person, and that might mean that they\u2019re wrong,\u201d she added. \u201cMaybe you believe forever that whatever they did was wrong.\u201d Twain and Lange, 75, were married for 15 years when he had an affair with Marie-Anne. The pair, who welcomed their son Eja in 2001, separated in 2008 and divorced two years later. In the aftermath of the affair, Twain fell in love with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Thi\u00e9baud, Marie-Anne\u2019s former husband. They got married in January 2011 and are still together. \u201cDo I hate my ex-husband for making a mistake? No. It\u2019s his mistake. Not my mistake,\u201d Twain said on the podcast. \u201cSo sad for him that he made such a great mistake that he has to live with. And I don\u2019t know what that is, but it\u2019s not \u2026 That\u2019s not my weight,\u201d she continued. Twain also acknowledged that her ex-husband had \u201cproblems,\u201d which has made it easier to forgive him. \u201cIt\u2019s not for him, not for, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s very hard to hate or not be able to forgive somebody that you believe. He\u2019s a human being that deserves empathy and understanding. I think we all do.\u201d Twain previously opened up about the affair that broke up her marriage in an exclusive interview with the New York Post in 2015. \u201cWhen that happened, I thought, \u2018Forget it, this is more than I can handle \u2014 I\u2019m never going to sing again,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI had to grieve through it.\u201d The \u201cFrom This Moment On\u201d singer also confirmed she doesn\u2019t have a relationship with her ex-best friend. \u201cI don\u2019t see her, ever. I don\u2019t invite that trigger into my life \u2026 She\u2019s not my future \u2014 she\u2019s my past,\u201d she said. Twain has learned to move past her ex-husband\u2019s affair with the help of Thi\u00e9baud, 54. In 2020, Twain spoke to People at the American Heart Association\u2019s annual Go Red For Women Red Dress Collection fashion show about how her current husband made her believe in love again. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful I found the faith and courage to love again \u2014 because the last thing you want to do when you\u2019re crushed is love again,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen you have a great loss, you lose faith; you get very discouraged. I\u2019m sure a lot of people say, \u2018I\u2019m never going to love again. I never want to fall in love again.\u2019 Songs have been written about that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really glad that that got turned around for me,\u201d Twain added, \u201cand that\u2019s what this relationship is.\u201d", "summary": "\"Forgiveness, more specifically for me anyway, is not about forgetting necessarily,\" Shania Twain said in relation to her ex-husband Mutt Lange's 2008 affair.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/shania-twain-on-ex-husbands-mistake-cheating-with-her-best-friend-sad-for-him/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/shania-twain-performs-grand-opening-82857323.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:59:48", "author": "Eric Todisco", "authors": ["Eric Todisco"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.225}

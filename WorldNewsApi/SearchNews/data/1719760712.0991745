According to our 2024 State of Financial Automation report, 85% of finance leaders at small and midsize businesses (SMBs) are enthusiastic about adopting AI. SMBs can benefit significantly from AI, as it can hedge and improve some of their major stressors. However, they also have limited time and resources, and the costs of experimentation can be prohibitive. The stakes are high, and investment in technology needs to be made with a clear ROI in mind. My prediction is that five years from now, every successful company will be using AI\u2014and those that are not will be at a disadvantage. If your business is developing or updating an AI strategy, make sure you separate myth from materiality. Myth No. 1: \"AI isn't relevant to my business.\" If you think AI isn't for you, think again. While enterprise businesses have made headlines with billion-dollar AI investments and acquisitions, it's not just for big players. There are affordable, scalable AI tools and features that can automate tasks and improve efficiency, and they may already be a part of your tech stack.

AI can help generate personalized emails or product recommendations tailored to your specific customer or business needs, saving you time and better targeting your marketing. This is an area where SMBs actually have an advantage over enterprises; their customer knowledge is deep and personal, which leads to better customization. SMBs can also use AI-supported chatbots and virtual assistants. From generating a quote for a first-time service to scheduling an appointment or answering questions, chatbots can be a low-cost way to reduce administration and focus on high-value customer interactions. Many software providers offer free or freemium trials to test and learn software before making a commitment. That's a great way to pilot new AI use cases before investing. Myth No. 2: \"AI is too risky for my business.\" Some entrepreneurs worry about AI bias, inaccuracy and security\u2014and these questions are valid. Generative AI is new, and SMBs might be asking whether this technology can be trusted. As with any technology, there is a broad spectrum of benefits and risks. To mitigate risk, I recommend choosing the right scenarios to deploy AI and avoid experimenting with mission-critical processes. Put another way, have AI serve you in suggestion mode rather than approval mode. It's also essential to keep \"humans in the loop\" to make sure you stay in control and get comfortable with the technology. AI is increasingly being integrated into many of the software solutions that SMBs already use\u2014payments technology, point of sale, payroll and email marketing. If you are using trusted solutions like these, it's worth exploring whether there are new or additional AI-backed features within these platforms that can help you optimize your business. If you're investing in AI with a new platform or partner, the following considerations can help you understand whether this is an AI solution you can trust. \u2022 Does this technology partner have a track record of regulatory compliance? \u2022 Does this technology allow you to keep \"humans in the loop\"? \u2022 Does the partner offer education resources to help build your understanding of this technology and the risks? Myth No. 3: \"We don't have the resources.\" SMBs continue to struggle with finding and affording great talent. I know many entrepreneurs are burning the candle at both ends, wearing multiple hats and trying to do more with less. AI should not add to staffing concerns; in fact, it could lessen them. It's a common misconception that AI adoption requires a team of data scientists. That was the case a few years ago, but it's no longer true for SMBs. In reality, you don't even have to have AI knowledge to use it, just like you don't need to be a software engineer to use a laptop. Accessibility matters for adoption and many AI solutions are designed with simple and intuitive workflows\u2014allowing even non-technical users to leverage their power. We expect ease of use will only improve as AI technologies become more ubiquitous and as AI becomes better integrated into existing technology solutions that SMBs use. AI tools can also help reduce the burden for your team, automating mundane tasks like invoice follow-up, scheduling and data entry\u2014leaving more time for your team to focus on creativity and customer care. In short, you can produce more positive outcomes with the same level of resources and help avoid burnout in the process. For example, Repurpose\u2014a female-founded business that makes sustainable modern tableware from plants\u2014uses our software to help it manage its cash flow. AI extracts all of the information it needs from bills and delivers it for review in an easy-to-understand app. AI capabilities have saved its finance team two days out of every work week. If your team members are worried about AI replacing jobs or adding more work, talk about how it can supercharge success and propel their work. AI doesn't work without human interaction and guidance, and creativity may spark new opportunities and uses. Key Takeaway It's understandable that myths and concerns are emerging around AI. It's not new technology, but it is advancing and being democratized quickly. We are still in the early days of understanding and influencing how it will reshape business and society. In a competitive landscape, SMBs don't need the biggest budgets or teams to capture their AI potential. They just need to ask the right questions and consider finding AI solutions that are tailor-made for SMBs. In a few years, you'll wonder how you ever did business without it.

The \u201clucky\u201d families were those whose loved ones\u2019 remains were retrieved by soldiers, at great risk, and brought home to Israel for burial. So the audacious rescue on Saturday of four living hostages instantly raised morale in Israel and offered at least a momentary victory for the country\u2019s embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. But by Sunday, euphoria was already giving way to a harsher reality. The heavy air and ground assault that accompanied the rescue killed scores of Palestinians, including civilians, according to Gaza health officials, puncturing Israel\u2019s claims that the operation was a resounding success, at least internationally. And the operation failed to resolve any of the deep dilemmas and challenges vexing the Israeli government, according to analysts.", "summary": "The operation conducted by Israel\u2019s military to free four hostages resulted in a high death toll among Palestinians and has not resolved the challenges facing the Israeli government.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-gaza.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/09/multimedia/09mideast-assess-01-cjkp/09mideast-assess-01-cjkp-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:13:33", "author": "Isabel Kershner", "authors": ["Isabel Kershner"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.04}

{"id": 243271700, "title": "Dua Lipa at Glastonbury review \u2013 headliners are rarely this hook-laden and hedonistic", "text": "According to the most intriguing bit of her between-song chat, Dua Lipa\u2019s headlining Glastonbury slot came about as a result of an act of childhood manifesting. The singer claims she wrote out her desire to top the bill on the Pyramid stage in detail, up to and including what night said event should take place on: a Friday, so she \u201ccould spend the rest of the weekend partying\u201d. And now here we are: watching a slightly peculiar video of Dua Lipa signing her name and writing the words \u201cGLASTO 24\u201d on a pane of glass, then licking it. Whether you buy the stuff about manifesting or not, Dua Lipa has clearly spent a lot of time carefully studying and absorbing how a successful Glastonbury headline set works, and putting what she\u2019s gleaned to good use. The announcement of her appearance led to a degree of consternation, particularly after her most recent album, Radical Optimism, failed to replicate the kind of world-beating success afforded its predecessor, the lockdown smash Future Nostalgia. But she already has a stockpile of inescapable hits, from New Rules to her Elton John collaboration Cold Heart, which is half the battle won. And furthermore she throws everything she has at her set in order to lend it a sense of event, rather than it being simply another pop show transposed to a field in Somerset, another stop-off on a world tour that happens to be on a farm. There are confetti canons galore. There are pyrotechnics \u2013 so many of them during Levitating that you wonder what they can possibly do for the finale, although they just about manage to top it. There is a crowdpleasing reference to the festival\u2019s hedonism, albeit not from the lips of the singer herself, who largely confines herself to asking the audience how they\u2019re feeling: instead, she takes the stage to the famous clip of Peter Fonda in the 1966 biker movie The Wild Angels informing the squares that he wants to get loaded and have a good time. And there is an equally crowdpleasing guest appearance by Tame Impala\u2019s Kevin Parker \u2013 his jeans and T-shirt at odds with the main attraction\u2019s constant costume changes; a moment where the pair fluff their vocals and laugh at odds with the show\u2019s tightly choreographed feel \u2013 performing not one of his Dua Lipa collaborations but his own biggest hit, The Less I Know the Better: 1.6bn streams and counting. Hallucinate makes some of Lipa\u2019s more recent efforts look a little wan by comparison. House-fuelled and thrillingly hook-laden, it may well be one of the best pop singles in recent memory \u2013 which is not a claim anyone is going to make on behalf of the serviceable but unexceptional Houdini, nor Training Season. There are a couple of less impressive songs from Radical Optimism thrown into the mix: the pass-aggy Happy for You; the acoustic guitar-driven These Walls. The latter was the solitary track on said album which vaguely suggested the Britpop influence she spent a lot of time talking up prior to its release, but listening to it tonight, it sounds more like the other stuff that sold millions in the 90s. It\u2019s not a huge stretch to imagine it sung by Texas or Natalie Imbruglia or even the Corrs. But the set tucks these songs away amid the hits so successfully that you scarcely notice. There\u2019s always another cast-iron banger on the way: Levitating, Physical, Illusion. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot, innit,\u201d she gasps at one point, surveying the full extent of an enormous crowd, who moreover stay put throughout: there\u2019s none of the wastage that signals a Glastonbury headliner getting it wrong and driving their audience towards the festival\u2019s other manifold delights. It\u2019s an unequivocal success.", "summary": "<p><strong>Pyramid stage</strong><br>The British singer\u2019s Friday night set underlines her claim to be one of the world\u2019s great current pop stars, with a cast-iron hit always around the corner</p><p>According to the most intriguing bit of her between-song chat, Dua Lipa\u2019s headlining Glastonbury slot came about as a result of an act of childhood manifesting.

The British government said it went public as it feared that the video could be used in the future and to raise awareness of this risk. Cameron is the latest European politician to fall victim to this type of misinformation related to the war in Ukraine. The British government said in 2022 that the Russian government was behind hoax calls to former U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Last fall, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni fell victim to a trap by Russian comedians who were pretending to be with the African Union.", "summary": "British foreign secretary became suspicious on call with man pretending to be ex-Ukrainian president.", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/david-cameron-hoax-petro-poroshenko/", "image": "https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=675,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08/12191819-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:30:37", "author": "Gregorio Sorgi", "authors": ["Gregorio Sorgi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "eu", "sentiment": 0.096}

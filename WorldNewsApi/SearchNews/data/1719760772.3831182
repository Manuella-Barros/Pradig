It will be returning to the Promenade de Larvotto in early June for its second edition. Unlike with many environmental and eco-aware initiatives, so often burdened with worrying messages and talk of concern and of risks, the Green Shift Festival is all about highlighting the good work being done around the world to make positive changes. Over three nights between 5th and 7th June on the Place Anne-Marie Campora, the event\u2019s organisers will present a varied and engaging programme that aims to inspire and promote balance between humanity and the natural environment.

The Kate Powers Foundation is joining the list of Green Shift Festival supporters in 2024, and representatives will run a number of morning yoga, meditation and dance sessions alongside the main event. Later in the day, Happy Hours from 6pm each evening will give participants the chance to network and learn more about the local efforts being made in Monaco, by the state and by residents, while enjoying dishes from Sexy Tacos.

They have since sold 20 million albums.\n\nThe band is made up of B-Real, Sen Dog and Eric Bobo.\n\nSpeaking of first seeing the Simpsons episode, Homerpalooza, the 54-year-old rapper told the PA news agency: \"When we got invited we were excited, just because it was the Simpsons and we were all fans of it.\n\n\"When it came out, all our friends that were Simpsons fans were elated, because it's not something we'd ever thought about.\n\n\"We weren't thinking about being on TV or any of that, we were just being musicians and doing our shows, that was the expectancy of it, let's go out and play our music and represent.\n\n\"As our popularity is growing, we'd done Lollapalooza, and we'd done really well, so we started getting people's attention, and then they invite us on the Simpsons.\n\n\"We were blown away by it, so when it comes out finally, it's like when your album comes out.\n\n\"It was like, what's it going to do? How are people going to react?\n\n\"We got a great reaction from it, and it was a hilarious episode.\n\n\"It just sort of lived on from there, throughout our career people have been like, 'hey, did you really steal Peter Frampton's symphony'.\"\n\nThe former The Herd singer and guitarist is on the guestlist for the show, although the band are unsure if he will take up their offer.\n\nBut despite the jokes, B-Real said the idea was something that \"always followed us\", and added the episode was \"inspiration\" for the band as far back as 1996, when it first come out.\n\nHe added: \"After the episode came out, our producer DJ Muggs was like, 'that might actually be a cool idea, we should probably do that'.\n\n\"He was talking about it with management and our agents for quite some time, then his schedule got demanding, and we all sort of forgot about it, and before you know it, Wu-Tang was doing a symphony show.\n\n\"And we thought, well f***, that's our destiny, we should be doing this, because we're with the Simpsons, and that's where the idea spawned for a hip-hop group to do an orchestra or a symphony in the first place.\"\n\nThe idea returned to the band when they put out a tweet to commemorate the moment in 2017, which was then quoted by the LSO, which said: \"We mostly play classical, but we'll give it a shot.\"\n\nWe mostly play classical... but we'll give it a shot. \ud83d\ude4c @cypresshill https://t.co/2XT3Z5tVsJ -- London Symphony Orchestra (@londonsymphony) April 25, 2017\n\nThe band have already played two US shows with the Colorado Symphony, which wrote the original orchestrations, which have now been adapted by the LSO, adding a \"darkness\", according to B-Real.\n\nHe said: \"Colorado Symphony wrote the first charts for us.\n\n\"What we did was we just gave them the music and said we don't want you to play over our track, because a lot of the time that's what a band will assume we want.\n\n\"In this case we said no, we're going to do everything organic, we're not going to play any of our track, we're going to do it all from the instruments, no samples, no existing tracks.\n\n\"We said, we would like it if you recreated the track.\n\n\"When we heard them back we were like, oh my god this shit, this is happening, and it sounds amazing.\n\n\"We were hoping the LSO would be open to the idea that they looked at the charts that had already been written, and maybe they wanted to rearrange it, or change some bits, or add to it.\n\n\"Fortunately, they did, they actually made it much darker than the previous ones, which we loved.\n\n\"Colorado did an excellent job of translating the music, but we felt like it could be darker, and we knew the LSO could definitely do that, and fortunately they did an amazing job.\"\n\nDuring the concert, the band will play Black Sunday in full, as it was the album which was out at the time of the Simpsons episode, as well as other fan favourites.\n\nB-Real added: \"People that have come to our symphony shows, they were very surprised on some of the songs we played outside of Black Sunday.\n\n\"We can't wait to see what the reaction is here.\"\n\nCypress Hill will play the Royal Albert Hall with the LSO on Wednesday, July 10. tickets are available from the venue's website.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"},

Fans think they've found the scene\n\nDuring the episode of The Simpsons, a puzzled coordinator backstage asked: 'Hello bands, who is playing with the London Symphony Orchestra?'\n\nNobody responded, much to his annoyance and he continued: 'Come on people, somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra, possibly while high!'\n\nHe then accused the hip hop group of ordering the musicians to play with them, saying: 'Cypress Hill, I'm looking in your direction'.\n\nThe panicked California collective then whispered to each other: 'Hey man did we order an orchestra? What's up with this orchestra, where'd this orchestra come from?'\n\nA member of the trio continued: 'No one told me about this man. We gotta do something,' before replying to the coordinator: 'Yeah, yeah, we think we did.'\n\nTurning to the orchestra, who were all suited and booted in black tuxedos he asked: 'Do you know Insane in the Brain?'\n\nThe orchestra's violinist admitted: 'We mostly know classical...but we could give it a shot.'\n\nThe orchestra then begins taking part in a rendition of the song, impressing Marge who beamed: 'Now this, I like'.\n\nThe episode would later reveal that the orchestra had actually been booked for Peter Frampton, the British-born guitarist and singer who performed in The Herd.\n\nCypress Hill will perform with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall (pictured) tonight\n\nIn the episode of The Simpsons the band perform an impromptu collaboration with the London Symphony Orchestra\n\nThe writers of the show joked that the weed-loving trio had accidentally booked the London Symphony Orchestra while high\n\nThe joked proved so popular that decades later people still rib Cypress Hill about the potential collaboration between the two very different band.\n\nB-Real said: 'We were blown away by it, so when it comes out finally, it's like when your album comes out.\n\n'It was like, what's it going to do? How are people going to react?\n\n'We got a great reaction from it, and it was a hilarious episode.\n\n'It just sort of lived on from there, throughout our career people have been like, 'hey, did you really steal Peter Frampton's symphony'.'\n\nREAD MORE The Simpsons producer apologizes to fans for killing long-running character\n\nThe former The Herd singer and guitarist is on the guestlist for the show, although the band are unsure if he will take up their offer after he didn't respond to their invitations.\n\nBut despite the jokes, B-Real said the idea was something that 'always followed us', and added the episode was 'inspiration' for the band as far back as 1996, when it first come out.\n\nHe added: 'After the episode came out, our producer DJ Muggs was like, 'that might actually be a cool idea, we should probably do that'.\n\n'He was talking about it with management and our agents for quite some time, then his schedule got demanding, and we all sort of forgot about it, and before you know it, Wu-Tang was doing a symphony show.\n\n'And we thought, well f***, that's our destiny, we should be doing this, because we're with the Simpsons, and that's where the idea spawned for a hip-hop group to do an orchestra or a symphony in the first place.'\n\nThe idea returned to the band when they put out a tweet to commemorate the moment in 2017, which was then quoted by the LSO, which said: 'We mostly play classical, but we'll give it a shot.'\n\nDutch conductor Bernard Haitink gestures to the London Symphony Orchestra during a performance at The Barbican in 2019\n\nThe band have already played two US shows with the Colorado Symphony, which wrote the original orchestrations, which have now been adapted by the LSO, adding a 'darkness', according to B-Real.\n\nHe said: 'Colorado Symphony wrote the first charts for us.\n\n'What we did was we just gave them the music and said we don't want you to play over our track, because a lot of the time that's what a band will assume we want.\n\n'In this case we said no, we're going to do everything organic, we're not going to play any of our track, we're going to do it all from the instruments, no samples, no existing tracks.\n\nREAD MORE Donald Trump's presidency, Richard Branson's space race and the rise of the smartwatch: The Simpsons' most accurate predictions over the years\n\n'We said, we would like it if you recreated the track.\n\n'When we heard them back we were like 'oh my God this s***, this is happening, and it sounds amazing'.\n\n'We were hoping the LSO would be open to the idea that they looked at the charts that had already been written, and maybe they wanted to rearrange it, or change some bits, or add to it.\n\n'Fortunately, they did, they actually made it much darker than the previous ones, which we loved.\n\n'Colorado did an excellent job of translating the music, but we felt like it could be darker, and we knew the LSO could definitely do that, and fortunately they did an amazing job.'\n\nDuring the concert, the band will play Black Sunday in full, as it was the album which was out at the time of the Simpsons episode, as well as other fan favourites.\n\nB-Real added: 'People that have come to our symphony shows, they were very surprised on some of the songs we played outside of Black Sunday.\n\n'We can't wait to see what the reaction is here.'\n\nIt means that once more something mentioned on The Simpsons has become reality, further bolstering the ranks of the shows Nostradamus-like powers of prediction.\n\nIn March 2000 the show prophetically joked about Donald Trump - that that point best known as a real estate magnate - becoming president of the United States.\n\nIn the episode Bart has a vision of the future where his sister Lisa become president where she states: 'We've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.'\n\nTrump would be elected president 16 years later, beating Hilary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nIn one episode of The Simpsons Bart is shown a vision of the future which includes Donald Trump becoming president of the United States\n\nImages of Sir Richard Branson enjoying a spaceflight went viral in 2021 after the businessman, 73, launched himself towards the stars, in a bizarre case of real life imitating art\n\nThe show also appeared to predict the United States beating Sweden in the final of the Winter Olympics to win gold in the Curling\n\nMoving away from politics, the show also portrayed Sir Richard Branson going into space in 2014, a full seven years before the British businessman managed the feat with Virgin Galactic.\n\nThe show also poked fun at magicians Siefried and Roy, famous for their glitzy shows in Las Vegas involving live animals including tigers.\n\nIn a 1993 episode of The Simpsons, a pair of magicians called Gunter and Ernst were introduced who bore a striking resemblance to the pair.\n\nThe episode showed the duo being attacked by the white tiger which was involved in their act - almost a decade before Roy Horn was attacked one of his own white tigers during a show at the Mirage casino.\n\nAnd in one of the shows more inspired pieces of foresight, The Simpsons appeared to predict the United States winning a gold medal in the Winter Olympics.\n\nIn a 2010 episode Homer and Marge were selected for the US Curling team at the Winter Olympics, with the pair helping their country win a gold medal in the final over Sweden.\n\nRemarkably this stoyline was repeated almost beat for beat - without Homer and Marge of course - at the 2008 Winter Olynpics in South Korea when the United States won gold in the Curling, triumphing against none other than Sweden in the final.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

Their hit Black Sunday album sold more than 3m copies in the US and spent a year in the UK charts.\n\nB-Real (real name Louis Mario Freese) told the BBC: \"It's been something that we've talked about for many years since the Simpsons episode first aired. So it's very special for us. And it's coming off the heels of our 30th anniversary for our Black Sunday album.\n\n\"We've played a lot of historical venues throughout our career and stuff like that, but nothing as prestigious as this.\"\n\nB-Real added that Cypress Hill had always reached for experimental collaborations as \"out-of-the-box artists\", including combining hip-hop with rock or metal or punk or reggae or electronic music.\n\nHe added: \"We salute the Simpsons because if they had not written that episode, we probably wouldn't be doing this.\"\n\nIn the Simpsons episode, titled Homerpalooza, Homer tries to impress Bart and Lisa by going to the Hullabalooza music festival - a play on the Lollapalooza music festival held in Chicago - and hanging out with 1990s rap and rock stars including Cypress Hill and The Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nIn the episode, a crew member calls \"somebody ordered\", adding \"possibly while high ... Cypress Hill, I'm looking in your direction\". This is followed by a rendition of Insane in the Brain, complete with the classic orchestral backing.\n\nCypress Hill have also invited the UK musician Peter Frampton, who features in the episode as the person trying to book the orchestra, although they are still waiting for a reply.\n\nThe LSO first violin and board vice-chair, Maxine Kwok, told the BBC that it was an important cultural reference and that \"people are beyond excited at the idea of these diverse musicians mixing on the stage\".\n\nShe said: \"Being a child of the 90s I remember the episode well.\"\n\nAt rehearsals there have been cultural differences, for example the LSO understood the word \"glock\" to mean the percussion instrument the glockenspeil, rather than a gun.\n\nThe Simpsons has previously predicted future events, including Trump's presidency, a tiger attack on the Las Vegas magicians Siegfried and Roy, and the US beating Sweden to win its first Winter Olympic Curling gold.", "source": {"uri":

They have since sold 20 million albums.\n\nThe band is made up of B-Real, Sen Dog and Eric Bobo.\n\nSpeaking of first seeing the Simpsons episode, Homerpalooza, the 54-year-old rapper told the PA news agency: \"When we got invited we were excited, just because it was the Simpsons and we were all fans of it.\n\n\"When it came out, all our friends that were Simpsons fans were elated, because it's not something we'd ever thought about.\n\n\"We weren't thinking about being on TV or any of that, we were just being musicians and doing our shows, that was the expectancy of it, let's go out and play our music and represent.\n\n\"As our popularity is growing, we'd done Lollapalooza, and we'd done really well, so we started getting people's attention, and then they invite us on the Simpsons.\n\n\"We were blown away by it, so when it comes out finally, it's like when your album comes out.\n\n\"It was like, what's it going to do? How are people going to react?\n\n\"We got a great reaction from it, and it was a hilarious episode.\n\n\"It just sort of lived on from there, throughout our career people have been like, 'hey, did you really steal Peter Frampton's symphony'.\"\n\nThe former The Herd singer and guitarist is on the guestlist for the show, although the band are unsure if he will take up their offer.\n\nBut despite the jokes, B-Real said the idea was something that \"always followed us\", and added the episode was \"inspiration\" for the band as far back as 1996, when it first come out.\n\nHe added: \"After the episode came out, our producer DJ Muggs was like, 'that might actually be a cool idea, we should probably do that'.\n\n\"He was talking about it with management and our agents for quite some time, then his schedule got demanding, and we all sort of forgot about it, and before you know it, Wu-Tang was doing a symphony show.\n\n\"And we thought, well f***, that's our destiny, we should be doing this, because we're with the Simpsons, and that's where the idea spawned for a hip-hop group to do an orchestra or a symphony in the first place.\"\n\nThe idea returned to the band when they put out a tweet to commemorate the moment in 2017, which was then quoted by the LSO, which said: \"We mostly play classical, but we'll give it a shot.\"\n\nThe band have already played two US shows with the Colorado Symphony, which wrote the original orchestrations, which have now been adapted by the LSO, adding a \"darkness\", according to B-Real.\n\nHe said: \"Colorado Symphony wrote the first charts for us.\n\n\"What we did was we just gave them the music and said we don't want you to play over our track, because a lot of the time that's what a band will assume we want.\n\n\"In this case we said no, we're going to do everything organic, we're not going to play any of our track, we're going to do it all from the instruments, no samples, no existing tracks.\n\n\"We said, we would like it if you recreated the track.\n\n\"When we heard them back we were like, oh my god this shit, this is happening, and it sounds amazing.\n\n\"We were hoping the LSO would be open to the idea that they looked at the charts that had already been written, and maybe they wanted to rearrange it, or change some bits, or add to it.\n\n\"Fortunately, they did, they actually made it much darker than the previous ones, which we loved.\n\n\"Colorado did an excellent job of translating the music, but we felt like it could be darker, and we knew the LSO could definitely do that, and fortunately they did an amazing job.\"\n\nDuring the concert, the band will play Black Sunday in full, as it was the album which was out at the time of the Simpsons episode, as well as other fan favourites.\n\nB-Real added: \"People that have come to our symphony shows, they were very surprised on some of the songs we played outside of Black Sunday.\n\n\"We can't wait to see what the reaction is here.\"\n\nCypress Hill will play the Royal Albert Hall with the LSO on Wednesday, July 10th. tickets are available from the venue's website.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 10 Jul 2024, 2:31 PM Last updated: Wed 10

hip-hop group Cypress Hill was to stage a special performance with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in the regal surroundings of the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nThe band will mainly play hits from its seminal 1993 album \"Black Sunday\", which sold more than three million copies in the United States and spent a year in the UK charts.\n\nThe LSO, which claims to be the world's most recorded orchestra, will add orchestral arrangements to the tracks, including \"Insane in the Brain\" and \"I Wanna Get High\".\n\nThe collaboration stems directly from a 1996 \"Simpsons\" episode -- not the first time the beloved US television show has correctly predicted, or perhaps influenced, the future.\n\nIn it, Cypress Hill -- known for supporting the use of marijuana, including in its song lyrics -- believed they had mistakenly booked the London orchestra while under the influence.\n\nFast-forward to 2019, and after years of fan demands for the joke to become a reality, the band and the LSO traded tweets on Twitter (now X), seemingly sealing their eventual tie-up.\n\n\"Lets do this @londonsymphony,\" wrote the Los Angeles-based trio, who in 2019 earned a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.\n\nThe LSO promptly replied quoting their line from 'The Simpsons': \"We mostly play classical, but we'll give it a shot.\"\n\nFive years later, the Royal Albert Hall awaits.\n\n\"It's been something that we've talked about for many years since the 'Simpsons' episode first aired,\" the band's B-Real -- real name Louis Mario Freese -- told the BBC ahead of the show.", "source": {"uri":

Ever since that iconic episode, 'Homerpalooza', aired, they've been hatching plans to hit the stage at none other than the illustrious Royal Albert Hall.\n\nREAD MORE: Too Hot To Handle Season 6: Exciting twists, new trailer, returning contestants and bigger prize revealed for new season\n\nREAD MORE: 'I need it': Apple TV Severance fans beg for season 2 release date\n\nSince their formation back in 1988, Cypress Hill has blasted through the roof with their 1993 hit album 'Black Sunday', which threw out bangers like Insane In The Brain and I Ain't Goin' Out Like That. With 20 million albums under their belt, the squad comprises lyrical wizard B-Real, the dynamic Sen Dog, and beats maestro Eric Bobo.\n\nChewing over that first glimpse of themselves on The Simpsons, the now 54-year-old B-Real gushed to PA news agency, confessing: \"When we got invited we were excited, just because it was the Simpsons and we were all fans of it. When it came out, all our friends that were Simpsons fans were elated, because it's not something we'd ever thought about.\", reports the Manchester Evening News.\n\n\"We weren't thinking about being on TV or any of that, we were just being musicians and doing our shows, that was the expectancy of it, let's go out and play our music and represent. As our popularity is growing, we'd done Lollapalooza, and we'd done really well, so we started getting people's attention, and then they invite us on the Simpsons.\"\n\n\"We were blown away by it, so when it comes out finally, it's like when your album comes out. It was like, what's it going to do? How are people going to react? We got a great reaction from it, and it was a hilarious episode.\" He continued: \"It just sort of lived on from there, throughout our career people have been like, 'hey, did you really steal Peter Frampton's symphony'.\"\n\nThe former The Herd singer and guitarist is on the guestlist for the show, although the band are unsure if he will take up their offer. But despite the jokes, B-Real said the idea was something that \"always followed us\", and added the episode was \"inspiration\" for the band as far back as 1996, when it first come out.\n\nHe added: \"After the episode came out, our producer DJ Muggs was like, 'that might actually be a cool idea, we should probably do that'. He was talking about it with management and our agents for quite some time, then his schedule got demanding, and we all sort of forgot about it, and before you know it, Wu-Tang was doing a symphony show.\"\n\n\"And we thought, well f***, that's our destiny, we should be doing this, because we're with the Simpsons, and that's where the idea spawned for a hip-hop group to do an orchestra or a symphony in the first place.\"\n\nThe band recalled the eureka moment when they tweeted in 2017 to mark the occasion, which prompted a response from the LSO: \"We mostly play classical, but we'll give it a shot.\"\n\nThe Colorado Symphony, who penned the original orchestrations and performed two US gigs with the band, have had their work adapted by the LSO, adding a \"darkness\", B-Real noted.\n\nHe remarked: \"Colorado Symphony wrote the first charts for us. When we heard them back we were like, oh my god this shit, this is happening, and it sounds amazing.\"\n\n\"We were hoping the LSO would be open to the idea that they looked at the charts that had already been written, and maybe they wanted to rearrange it, or change some bits, or add to it. Fortunately, they did, they actually made it much darker than the previous ones, which we loved.\"\n\nAt the concert, fans can expect the full 'Black Sunday' album experience, as it coincided with the iconic Simpsons episode, alongside other crowd-pleasers. B-Real expressed his anticipation: \"People that have come to our symphony shows, they were very surprised on some of the songs we played outside of Black Sunday. We can't wait to see what the reaction is here.\"\n\nCypress Hill will play the Royal Albert Hall with the LSO on Wednesday, July 10.

So it's very special for us.

When asked if the Humble Pie legend was on the guest list, B-Real laughs and says, \"Yes, actually, we've been trying to invite him\".\n\nThough they're still waiting to hear a response from the musician, he adds, \"We've never met him before, but we thought it would be a kick to invite the legendary Peter Frampton.\"\n\nMaxine Kwok, LSO first violin and board vice-chair, says of the crossover: \"people are beyond excited at the idea of these diverse musicians mixing on the stage\", before noting how she remembers the Simpsons episode \"well\".\n\nAccording to Kwok, at rehearsals there were even a few cultural differences. Where the LSO would say \"glock\" when referring to the glockenspeil instrument, Cypress Hill always used the term to refer to guns.", "source": {"uri": "loudersound.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "loudersound"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_scarlett@loudersound.com", "name": "Liz Scarlett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cypress Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Albert Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Symphony Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Simpsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-Real", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "B-Real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lollapalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crossover music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble_Pie", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humble Pie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Frampton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Frampton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Smashing Pumpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homer Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audio mixing (recorded music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BEk8s3ihm8H2977JznsBzC-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718803", "eventUri": "eng-9718803", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 74, "textEnd": 81, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

They've been plotting ever since that landmark 'Homerpalooza' episode to perform at the prestigious Royal Albert Hall.\n\nFormed in 1988, Cypress Hill skyrocketed to fame with their smash-hit album 'Black Sunday' released in 1993, spinning tracks like 'Insane In The Brain' and 'I Ain't Goin' Out Like That' into the stratosphere. With over 20 million albums sold, the group features wordsmith B-Real, the energetic Sen Dog, and master of beats, Eric Bobo.\n\nReflecting on their first animated appearance, the now 54-year-old B-Real excitedly shared with the PA news agency, admitting: \"When we got invited we were excited, just because it was the Simpsons and we were all fans of it. When it came out, all our friends that were Simpsons fans were elated, because it's not something we'd ever thought about.\"\n\n\"We weren't thinking about being on TV or any of that, we were just being musicians and doing our shows, that was the expectancy of it, let's go out and play our music and represent. As our popularity is growing, we'd done Lollapalooza, and we'd done really well, so we started getting people's attention, and then they invite us on the Simpsons.\n\n\"We were blown away by it, so when it comes out finally, it's like when your album comes out. It was like, what's it going to do? How are people going to react? We got a great reaction from it, and it was a hilarious episode. It just sort of lived on from there, throughout our career people have been like, 'hey, did you really steal Peter Frampton's symphony'.\"\n\nThe former The Herd singer and guitarist is on the guestlist for the show, although the band are unsure if he will take up their offer. But despite the jokes, B-Real said the idea was something that \"always followed us\", and added the episode was \"inspiration\" for the band as far back as 1996, when it first come out.\n\n\"After the episode came out, our producer DJ Muggs was like, 'that might actually be a cool idea, we should probably do that'. He was talking about it with management and our agents for quite some time, then his schedule got demanding, and we all sortissort of forgot about it, and before you know it, Wu-Tang was doing a symphony show,\" he explained.\n\n\"And we thought, well f***, that's our destiny, we should be doing this, because we're with the Simpsons, and that's where the idea spawned for a hip-hop group to do an orchestra or a symphony in the first place,\" he added.\n\nThe band reminisced on their lightbulb moment and took to Twitter in 2017 to celebrate it. They even got a cheeky reply from the LSO: \"We mostly play classical, but we'll give it a shot.\"\n\nIt was the dark and brooding adaptation by the London Symphony Orchestra that threw a new shade over the tunes initially orchestrated by the Colorado Symphony. B-Real enthused about the original collaboration: \"Colorado Symphony wrote the first charts for us. When we heard them back we were like, oh my god this shit, this is happening, and it sounds amazing.\"\n\nB-Real shared his hopes for the LSO's take on the music: \"We were hoping the LSO would be open to the idea that they looked at the charts that had already been written, and maybe they wanted to rearrange it, or change some bits, or add to it. Fortunately, they did, they actually made it much darker than the previous ones, which we loved.\"\n\nThe band's performance promises fans the full 'Black Sunday' album thrill, as it meshes with the unforgettable Simpsons episode, along with other fan favourites. B-Reals excitement was palpable: \"People that have come to our symphony shows, they were very surprised on some of the courses we played outside of Black Sunday. We can't wait to see what the reaction is here.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susan_knox@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Susan Knox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ellie_kemp@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Ellie Kemp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-Real", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B-Real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cypress Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Symphony Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Simpsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ain't_Goin'_Out_Like_That", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "I Ain't Goin' Out Like That"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homerpalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homerpalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_\"Bobo\"_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric \"Bobo\" Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sen_Dog", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sen Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Albert Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(storm)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Sunday (storm)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Frampton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Frampton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lollapalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Muggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DJ Muggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classical music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33213583.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Simpsons.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718803", "eventUri": "eng-9718803", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 346, "textEnd": 353}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Frampton was the one trying to book the LSO in the episode, and Cypress Hill has extended him an invitation. According to a report from Ultimate Classic Rock, Frampton hasn't responded, but the group remains hopeful.\n\n\"We've never met him before,\" B-Real continued, \"but we thought it would be a kick to invite the legendary Peter Frampton.\"\n\nAccording to the BBC report, Cypress Hill reached out to the LSO through its social media team, and the two groups struck a deal for the concert.

It sold more than three million copies in the US and spent a whole year on the UK charts.\n\nThe LSO will perform unique orchestral arrangements of the band's most iconic songs including Insane in the Brain and I Wanna Get High.\n\nCypress Hill have sold more than 20 million albums worldwide and are one of hip-hop's biggest acts.\n\nI went to meet the band at their rehearsals in central London.\n\n\"It's been something that we've talked about for many years since the Simpsons episode first aired,\" B-Real (real name Louis Mario Freese) told the BBC.\n\n\"So it's very special for us. And it's coming off the heels of our 30th anniversary for our Black Sunday album.\"\n\nThey called the ability to play on London's most famous stage \"one of those checklist moments\".\n\n\"We've played a lot of historical venues throughout our career and stuff like that, but nothing as prestigious as this.\"\n\nIn The Simpsons episode, Homerpalooza, Homer is shocked while on a school run that his music tastes are not considered cool.\n\nHe then tries to impress the kids by going to the Hullabalooza music festival - a play on the Lollapalooza music festival held in Chicago - and hanging out with rap and rock stars including Cypress Hill and The Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nThe British connection goes beyond the LSO. In the episode, it was actually Peter Frampton, best known for his 1976 album Frampton Comes Alive, who was the guy trying to book the orchestra.\n\nCypress Hill laughed when I asked if he was on the guestlist.\n\n\"Yes, actually, we've been trying to invite him,\" B-Real said.\n\n\"We've never met him before, but we thought it would be a kick to invite the legendary Peter Frampton.\"\n\nThey're still waiting for a reply.\n\nLSO first violin and board vice-chair Maxine Kwok said \"people are beyond excited at the idea of these diverse musicians mixing on the stage\".\n\n\"Being a child of the nineties I remember the episode well,\" she told the BBC, sharing that it was a cultural reference and \"running joke\" for years each time the episode was repeated.\n\nAt rehearsals there have been cultural differences, leading to misunderstandings.\n\nWhen the word \"glock\" was used, the LSO took it to mean the percussion instrument the glockenspeil. To Cypress Hill, glock will always be a gun.\n\nThis isn't the first time an event in The Simpsons has accurately predicted what has happened in reality many years in the future.\n\nWhether the show writers can predict the future or not....\n\nFor Cypress Hill, at least, they feel tonight's show has been their destiny.\n\nLater in their career, the act said they became more experimental \"combining hip-hop with rock or metal or punk or reggae or electronic\" and that their new orchestral collaboration is part of who they are as \"out-of-the-box artists\".\n\n\"We salute The Simpsons because if they had not written that episode, we probably wouldn't be doing this.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They rose to prominence as pioneers of the West Coast hip-hop scene in the 1990s, standing out with a mix of English and Spanish lyrics and B-Real's nasal rapping style, as well as for being vocal \"activists, advocates, connoisseurs and consumers\" of cannabis years before it was legalised in many US states.\n\nIt was a \"taboo\" subject when they started rapping about it, they say. \"Hopefully [in the] next five, six years we'll see legalisation here in England, that would be awesome.\"\n\nWhen they appeared in The Simpsons, in an episode titled Homerpalooza, the joke was they had accidentally booked a gig with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) while under the influence at a festival. \"Somebody ordered\" the LSO, a crew member calls. \"Possibly while high... Cypress Hill, I'm looking in your direction.\" It leads to a rendition of Insane In The Brain, complete with the classic orchestral backing.\n\nA cameo in The Simpsons showed how famous the band had become. But back then, the orchestra collaboration was simply a \"cool idea\" for an episode; the band members didn't envision it actually happening in real life. But when they tweeted a \"what if?\" clip a few years ago, the conversation was started on social media.\n\n'These are the elite musicians of the world'\n\nThey were due to begin their first rehearsal with the orchestra only yesterday afternoon, which doesn't seem like much time - but they performed a few symphony shows in the US last year as their \"path\" to the Royal Albert Hall, and seem relaxed about playing together for the first time less than 48 hours before the gig. The LSO themselves have promised it will be \"an unforgettable musical moment\".\n\n\"We feel confident that on our end we're definitely ready to deliver,\" says B-Real. \"And we know these are the elite musicians of the world, so we know they'll be ready.\"\n\nSen Dog (real name Senen Reyes) grew up listening to classical music through his father, who would play the works of composers such as Beethoven and Tchaikovsky.\n\n\"It crept into my subconscious to where now I'll seek it out on my own and listen to it when I'm in the car or I'm at home relaxing, whatever,\" he says. \"So it's not like something completely out of left field, per se, but doing Cypress Hill with it there's definitely a different twist.\"\n\n\"I actually listen to classical music more often these days than ever,\" says B-Real, who became interested in the music of Mozart, Chopin and Haydn as a young adult. \"Not in relation to what we're doing, it's just having an appreciation for it. We started off as hip-hop artists, this is what we love to do, the roots of our existence. But we've always challenged ourselves to be out of the box and do different things... to be able to be crossing over into [classical] is amazing.\"\n\nHe thanks musician and Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, who founded the Lollapalooza festival, which in turn inspired the Simpsons episode. \"And thanks to The Simpsons for writing us into that episode to allow us to do what we're doing.\"\n\nSimpsons Trump prediction: 'This is the biggest job in America'\n\nThe Simpsons has become famous for predicting the future, from correct Super Bowl outcomes to video calling. But the most well-known seeming prophecy was the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016 - which could well happen again later this year.\n\nHow do they feel about the upcoming US election?\n\n\"In my opinion, two senior citizens shouldn't be allowed to run for president,\" says B-Real - Trump is 78, while Joe Biden is 81. \"From [age] 45 to 65, that should be the criteria. Like the way that, at least in America, the major organisations or corporations always look to retire their CEOs at 65, whether they want to or not.\n\n\"This is the biggest job in America. Why would we be allowing guys in their 80s when they would be retired in whatever corporations they were CEOs of at that point? It's just ridiculous. I think we need a structural change in our political system... There's a lot of problems going on back home, but since before we were born, it's always an ongoing thing with politics. You know, and I don't trust any of them, to be honest with you.\"\n\nThe age bracket of 45 to 65 is one they all fit into now... \"Yeah, I could totally run,\" B-Real laughs. \"But would you vote for me? is the question. Maybe if I go out there and say the most ridiculous things, I'll get the votes. Because that's what it seems like these days. The most ridiculous things you could say, doesn't even have to be based off facts, you know? It's pretty mind-blowing what people are buying into these days.\"\n\nFor now though, they're not thinking about politics. Just their Simpsons prophecy coming true.\n\n\"Amazing. Incredible. Timeless,\" says B-Real, summing up what to expect from the show. DJ Lord promises a \"good time\", while Sen Dog adds: \"Expect the unexpected.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Inspired by @TheSimpsons via the 'Homerpalooza' episode.\"\n\n\"It's been something that we've talked about for many years since 'The Simpsons' episode first aired,\" B-Real told the BBC.\n\n\"So it's very special for us. And it's coming off the heels of our 30th anniversary for our Black Sunday album.\"\n\nCypress Hill became the first hip hop group to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2019.\n\nIn 2018, the band told the Post, \"We all took mushrooms,\" while making that album. \"We're peaking on the mushrooms [as] we did the vocals to 'I Ain't Goin' Out Like That,'\" B-Real said.\n\nLSO first violin and board vice-chair Maxine Kwok told the BBC, \"People are beyond excited at the idea of these diverse musicians mixing on the stage. Being a child of the nineties I remember the episode well,\" adding that it was a cultural reference and \"running joke\" for years.\n\nThe band - which includes members B-Real, Sen Dog (Senen Reyes), Eric Bobo (Eric Correa), and DJ Muggs (Lawrence Muggerud) - told the outlet that the ability to play on London's most famous stage is \"one of those checklist moments.\"\n\n\"We've played a lot of historical venues throughout our career and stuff like that, but nothing as prestigious as this.\"\n\nThe Black Sunday album sold more than three million copies in the US and spent a year on the UK charts.\n\nThis is just the latest real-life event that \"The Simpsons\" has predicted.\n\nIn a March 2000 episode, 16 years before Donald Trump got elected in 2016, Bart sees a vision of the future where Lisa becomes the president, and says, \"We've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.\"\n\nIn a 2010 episode, the US team beat Sweden at Curling in the Winter Olympics. Sure enough, in the South Korea Winter Olympics in 2018, team USA won their first Winter Olympic Curling gold metal, triumphing over Sweden.\n\nCypress Hill said in a statement to the Daily Mail, \"We are thrilled to be performing with the London Symphony Orchestra in such a prestigious venue as the Royal Albert Hall.

After a joke in a 1996 episode, the London Symphony Orchestra are to play Cypress Hill's Black Sunday album at Royal Albert Hall.\n\nThe long-running series The Simpsons has built a reputation over the years for predicting the future.\n\nMatt Groening's animated sitcom has become notorious for some of its episodes and jokes becoming eerily accurate, in what some choose to believe is a stranger-than-fiction power of \"prediction\".\n\nAdhere to this or not, there's no arguing with the fact that tonight (Wednesday 10 July), one of their soothsaying moments becomes a reality...\n\nIndeed, nearly 30 years after the show predicted it, Cypress Hill are set to share a stage with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe joke harks back to a 1996 episode titled 'Homerpalooza', which saw Homer join the fictional travelling music festival 'Hullabalooza'. It included a banana-skinned roadie claiming the members of hip-hop outfit Cypress Hill \"ordered the London Symphony Orchestra\" while high and therefore must perform with them.\n\nCheck out the moment below:\n\nIn April 2023, Cypress Hill responded to an Instagram Reel of their Simpson's cameo saying they plan to \"make the gig with the London Symphony a reality.\"\n\nAnd now, the show's art-anticipating-life precognitive powers come full circle, with the iconic hip-hop band set to perform at the Royal Albert Hall tonight with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAccording to the website, the LSO will be performing hits from the hip-hop collective's extensive back-catalogue, their revered album Black Sunday, as well as unique orchestral arrangements of Cypress Hill's most iconic songs including 'Insane in the Brain' and 'I Wanna Get High'.\n\nThe band have admitted performing a show at the Royal Albert Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra is \"probably one of the biggest moments\" for them.\n\n\"We've done some pretty damn big gigs, but this is with some of the best musicians in the world. So, yeah, we're excited,\" band member B-Real told Sky News.\n\n\"We've played a lot of historical venues throughout our 32 years of making music... this is one of the places that as a hip-hop artist, you don't expect... so that's another thing we're honoured by, is that we're not only playing with the LSO, but we're playing in their house - the most prestigious place to play.\"\n\nHe added: \"We feel confident that on our end we're definitely ready to deliver. And we know these are the elite musicians of the world, so we know they'll be ready.\"\n\nIn case you doubt The Simpsons and its future predictions,check out our list of the show's most prescient prognostications, including foreseeing Donald Trump's presidency, Disney buying 20th Century Fox, the outrage surrounding Michelangelo's statue of David, and most recently, the launch of Apple Vision Pro.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cypress Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Symphony Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Simpsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Albert Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Groening", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Groening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animated sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homerpalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homerpalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homer Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-Real", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "B-Real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insane_in_the_Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insane in the Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orchestra"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/56/48/56/1200x675_cmsv2_e2ecc64d-c557-58c1-9fc1-31773c4f7620-8564856.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718803", "eventUri": "eng-9718803", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 614, "textEnd": 621}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

For Cypress Hill, the bit involved the group ordering the London Symphony Orchestra for their concert performance \"possibly while high.\" After Sen Dog, B-Real and DJ Muggs huddle up, the group sheepishly decides that yes, they likey did indeed order them.\n\nThe two entities join forces to perform the most ornate version of \"Insane in the Brain\" that's ever been done. Good times, good bit, Homer learns a lesson, cue Gracie Films logo.\n\nWell, here we are, 28 years later and that bit has become a reality, as on July 10th, Cypress Hill will be performing with the LSO at London's Royal Albert Hall. The legendary venue's official website even describes the event by referencing the joke! They all know what they're doing.\n\nRegardless, Cypress Hill's performance is described as being \"a special rendition\" of their 1993 album, Black Sunday, \"as well as other hits from their extensive back-catalog\" complete orchestral accompaniment. Sounds like a good time, if I'm being honest here.\n\nDuring rehearsals, B-Real (Louis Mario Freese) told the BBC that \"It's been something that we've talked about for many years since The Simpsons episode first aired.\" They even attempted to invite Peter Frampton, who in the context of the original episode had actually ordered the LSO.\n\nWith real life reflecting art, it's just a matter of time now before Sonic Youth raids Peter Frampton's cooler.

prediction comes true", "body": "Cypress Hill are getting ready to fulfil their 'destiny' by making a prediction from the Simpsons come true after nearly 30 years.\n\nThe cartoon has managed to predict some of the biggest real-life events of the last few years, including Donald Trump's presidency and the World Cup final.\n\nFans went into meltdown last year when the iconic 80s legends announced that they would be performing with the London Symphony Orchestra - with many recalling that this actually happened in a 1996 episode of the animated series.\n\nUnpacking the eerie premonition two decades later, the band, made up of B-Real, Sen Dog and Eric Bobo, couldn't get enough of the coincidence.\n\nB-Real - real name Louis Mario Freese - explained that the idea of performing with the acclaimed orchestra 'always followed' them after the episode aired, describing it as 'inspiration'.\n\n'After the episode came out, our producer DJ Muggs was like, \"That might actually be a cool idea, we should probably do that,'\" he told PA.\n\n'He was talking about it with management and our agents for quite some time, then his schedule got demanding, and we all forgot about it, and before you know it, Wu-Tang was doing a symphony show.\n\n'And we thought, well f**k, that's our destiny, we should be doing this, because we're with the Simpsons, and that's where the idea spawned for a hip-hop group to do an orchestra or a symphony in the first place.'\n\nThankfully, we don't have to wait much longer as Cypress Hill and the London Symphony Orchestra will finally share the stage on Wednesday at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nDiscussing their appearance on the episode in question, B-Real continued: 'We were blown away by it, so when it comes out finally, it's like when your album comes out.\n\n'We got a great reaction from it, and it was a hilarious episode.'\n\nCypress Hill first formed in 1988 in California, and released their self-titled debut album in 1991.\n\nThey shot to superstardom two years later with the release of their Black Sunday record - which included hits Insane In The Brain and I Ain't Goin' Out Like That.\n\nThe group are still going strong and dropped their 10th album, Back in Black, in 2022.\n\nIn 1996, their career exploded with their appearance on the Simpsons, in the season seven episode, Homerpalooza - which saw Homer embark on a journey of music discovery after realizing that classic rock was no longer a 'cool' genre.\n\nIn classic Homer style, he ended up partying with some of the biggest musicians on the planet in his quest to find new favorites, with the Smashing Pumpkins and Sonic Youth also making a cameo.\n\nAt one point, a man questioned who had ordered the London Symphony Orchestra before pointing the finger at Cypress Hill - in a scene that has set the real-life performance into motion.\n\nThe trio panicked and asked whether the orchestra knew Insane in the Brain, and the rest is history.\n\nIf you've

At least, that's what we tell ourselves.\n\nSimpsons fans are often accused of being stuck in the past, and it's a fair charge. But, in our defence, the past was a lot better than our awful, Simpsons-less present. And besides, it isn't just us. Fans of the show had their interest piqued this week when it was revealed that hip hop group Cypress Hill will be collaborating with the London Symphony Orchestra to bring a joke from a 1996 Simpsons episode to life.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with one of the best episodes of television ever made, the collab refers to the season seven episode \"Homerpalooza\", in which the family attends a music festival and runs into a slew of celebrity guests including Sonic Youth and the Smashing Pumpkins. At one point a crew member asks whether somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra \"possibly while high\", and after a brief discussion the group assumes it must have been them. The orchestra then plays the band's hit song \"Insane in the Membrane\", which Marge approves of.\n\nIt's a great bit, made funnier later in the episode, when a furious Peter Frampton reveals that the orchestra was actually supposed to perform with him. In another piece of art-imitating-life-potentially-imitating-art, Frampton has been invited to perform at the concert, but is yet to commit.\n\nLook, far be it from me to accuse somebody else of being stuck in the past. I'm currently on my fifth Buffy the Vampire Slayer rewatch, and I'm in an eBay bidding war for a classic Goosebumps hoodie. I miss that period in the early-2000s when BBC would show a Fresh Prince\\Star Trek\\Simpsons triple-bill as much as the next childless millennial.\n\nBut as cool as this Cypress Hill collab is, it really feels like the point at which our nostalgia for America's funniest and yellowest family may have reached critical mass. Imagine renting out a concert hall, drafting 60 of the greatest classical musicians in the world, and rehearsing for weeks, just to make a reference to a 45-second joke in an episode of television that came out before half of the orchestra's percussion section was born.\n\nIt's not even the best joke in that episode (that honour still goes to Billy Corgan introducing himself to Homer as \"Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins\", and Homer responding \"Homer Simpson, smiling politely\"). It would be like if somebody actually came up with a get-rich-quick scheme that involved stealing cooking grease, and said they were inspired by a similar ploy in the just-okay episode \"Lard of the Dance\". Oh wait, that actually happened too.\n\nThe Simpsons is often accused of predicting the future, but I'm not sure it counts when people go out of their way to make sure things from the show end up happening. Sure, it was weird that Trump ended up being president after that exact scenario took place in the 2000 episode \"Bart to the Future\", but it's not like he ran because the show told him to. At least, god, I hope that's not what happened.\n\nAt some point in the 1990s The Simpsons achieved total cultural supremacy, and then abruptly stopped being watchable. It was worse than when a great show gets cancelled in its prime, like Firefly or Arrested Development, because a lot of us spent a very long time lying to ourselves that it would one day return to its former glory. Even today, people can't agree on exactly when the show \"got bad\" (the correct answer is season nine, episode 11, \"All Singing, All Dancing\"), and some sickos even try to rehabilitate the post-season 10 episodes because they confuse nostalgia for quality.\n\nBut this really feels like a sign that we finally need to let it go. Not just The Simpsons, but our addiction to nostalgia in general. Not everything needs to be a reference to something that happened in the past. We're allowed to create new things. We should be creating new things.\n\nWe're at a point of cultural stagnation because all of our most popular movies and TV shows are based on properties that came out 20 to 60 years ago. We can only tap that well for so long before it dries up - in fact, there's a good chance it already has. Maybe it's better to leave the memories alone. The Simpsons did a lot of great things, but it's old now, and old people are useless.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Simpsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Frampton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Frampton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cypress Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London Symphony Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homerpalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homerpalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Smashing Pumpkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homer Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonic Youth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imagine (John Lennon song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Corgan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billy Corgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marge_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marge Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classical music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percussion instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrested Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_to_the_Future", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bart to the Future"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/22/16/image002.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718803", "eventUri": "eng-9718803", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Cypress Hill, I'm looking at you.\"\n\nThat led the band members, who voiced their own characters in the episode, to talk amongst themselves and ask \"Do you know \"Insane In The Brain?\"\n\n\"We mostly do contemporary pieces but we'll give it a go\"\n\nQueue an orchestral mash-up of \"Insane In The Brain\" with violin and cello stabs throughout, leading Marge Simpson to remark \"Now that's culture!\"\n\nAs you can probably appreciate, \"The Simpsons\" and Cypress Hill fanbases went wild. It once again proved a point in pop culture that \"The Simpsons did it first,\" with comments about why it took so long to happen when other artists from other music fields had done the same.\n\nFor example, Metallica released \"S&M\" in 1999 with the band collaborating with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, while Serj Tankian released a version of his solo album collaborating with the Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra in 2010, \"Elect the Dead Symphony.\"\n\nHow did I feel as a longtime fan of \"The Simpsons\" and Cypress Hill? I thought it was an elaborate prank until the tickets went on sale.\n\nA who's who of alternative music talent; \"Homerpalooza\" features the likes of Sonic Youth, Peter Frampton and The Smashing Pumpkins.\n\nOne of the other famous lines from the episode involved The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan introducing himself after appreciating Homer's \"metaphor\" for being shot in the stomach with a cannonball (spoiler: it was all an accident).\n\nDoor and set times have been revealed, with the following itinerary set to occur later this evening:\n\nThere are currently no tickets available on Ticketmaster due to the show taking place in less than 24 hours, however, there might still be some tickets left at the box office or direct through the Royal Albert Hall themselves.",

What they mean is that they're fan of that impossibly brief window, from 1991 to 1997 - 1998 at a push - when The Simpsons perfected the animated sitcom format and became the best thing on television.\n\nUnfortunately, as all true fans of The Simpsons know, it was then abruptly cancelled, saving it from the ignobility of becoming a shambling corpse of itself as it made jokes about iPads and Lady Gaga in a pathetic attempt to remain relevant 25 years after its prime. At least, that's what we tell ourselves.\n\nSimpsons fans are often accused of being stuck in the past, and it's a fair charge. But, in our defence, the past was a lot better than our awful, Simpsons-less present. And besides, it isn't just us. Fans of the show had their interest piqued this week when it was revealed that hip hop group Cypress Hill will be collaborating with the London Symphony Orchestra to bring a joke from a 1996 Simpsons episode to life.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with one of the best episodes of television ever made, the collab refers to the season seven episode \"Homerpalooza\", in which the family attends a music festival and runs into a slew of celebrity guests including Sonic Youth and the Smashing Pumpkins. At one point a crew member asks whether somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra \"possibly while high\", and after a brief discussion the group assumes it must have been them. The orchestra then plays the band's hit song \"Insane in the Membrane\", which Marge approves of.\n\nIt's a great bit, made funnier later in the episode, when a furious Peter Frampton reveals that the orchestra was actually supposed to perform with him. In another piece of art-imitating-life-potentially-imitating-art, Frampton has been invited to perform at the concert, but is yet to commit.\n\nLook, far be it from me to accuse somebody else of being stuck in the past. I'm currently on my fifth Buffy the Vampire Slayer rewatch, and I'm in an eBay bidding war for a classic Goosebumps hoodie. I miss that period in the early-2000s when BBC would show a Fresh Prince\\Star Trek\\Simpsons triple-bill as much as the next childless millennial.\n\nBut as cool as this Cypress Hill collab is, it really feels like the point at which our nostalgia for America's funniest and yellowest family may have reached critical mass. Imagine renting out a concert hall, drafting 60 of the greatest classical musicians in the world, and rehearsing for weeks, just to make a reference to a 45-second joke in an episode of television that came out before half of the orchestra's percussion section was born.\n\nIt's not even the best joke in that episode (that honour still goes to Billy Corgan introducing himself to Homer as \"Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins\", and Homer responding \"Homer Simpson, smiling politely\"). It would be like if somebody actually came up with a get-rich-quick scheme that involved stealing cooking grease, and said they were inspired by a similar ploy in the just-okay episode \"Lard of the Dance\". Oh wait, that actually happened too.\n\nThe Simpsons is often accused of predicting the future, but I'm not sure it counts when people go out of their way to make sure things from the show end up happening. Sure, it was weird that Trump ended up being president after that exact scenario took place in the 2000 episode \"Bart to the Future\", but it's not like he ran because the show told him to. At least, god, I hope that's not what happened.\n\nAt some point in the 1990s The Simpsons achieved total cultural supremacy, and then abruptly stopped being watchable. It was worse than when a great show gets cancelled in its prime, like Firefly or Arrested Development, because a lot of us spent a very long time lying to ourselves that it would one day return to its former glory. Even today, people can't agree on exactly when the show \"got bad\" (the correct answer is season nine, episode 11, \"All Singing, All Dancing\"), and some sickos even try to rehabilitate the post-season 10 episodes because they confuse nostalgia for quality.\n\nBut this really feels like a sign that we finally need to let it go. Not just The Simpsons, but our addiction to nostalgia in general. Not everything needs to be a reference to something that happened in the past. We're allowed to create new things.

They thought they killed him because of the way he... the way he reacted when he got hit.\"\n\nHowever, the rivals then \"switched the gun\" and tried to shoot B-Real, firing four shots, with the fourth ricocheting off the wall before catching B-Real in the side.\n\nHe managed to stay on his feet until the rival gang members left the scene before collapsing on the ground because the bullet had pierced his lung (the fragments remain lodged in his body to this day).\n\nB-Real has previously credited his music career in Cypress Hill for his eventual escape from the gangster lifestyle, having shot to fame in the 1990s and sold more than 20 million albums.\n\nIn 1996, Cypress Hill appeared in an episode of The Simpsons, featuring in a joke in which the group thought they had mistakenly booked the London Symphony Orchestra while inebriated.\n\nThis week, 28 years after the episode aired, the hip-hop legends will make the joke a reality and perform with the orchestra for a one-night only gig at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nCypress Hill made contact with the orchestra over social media and will perform tracks from their acclaimed album, Black Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_davies@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Matt Davies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-Real", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B-Real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sen_Dog", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sen Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cypress Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve-O", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve-O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Muggs", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DJ Muggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insane_in_the_Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insane in the Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloods", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellow_Man_Ace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mellow Man Ace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Albert Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Symphony_Orchestra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Symphony Orchestra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Simpsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33210154.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS338969947.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718803", "eventUri": "eng-9718803", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

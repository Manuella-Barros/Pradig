The volume then fell to Tk 1.41 trillion in November 2023 and Tk 1.55 trillion in January 2024. However, it rose to Tk 1.62 trillion in February and Tk 1.76 trillion in April 2024.\n\nWhile talking to The Financial Express on condition of anonymity, a Bangladesh Bank official said the liquidity situation has improved after months of tightness due to various central bank policy measures.\n\n\"Commercial banks have been fully meeting the government's domestic borrowing requirements since the central bank decided to skip devolvement to control inflation from the beginning of this financial year (FY24). This put immense pressure on bank liquidity,\" he said.\n\nThe central bank has been consistently accepting all funding requests from commercial banks to provide them with breathing space, the official added.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, liquidity injections into banks have increased significantly in recent months, which has largely improved the banking sector's liquidity position.\"\n\nAccording to central bank data, liquidity support to banks rose from Tk 633.47 billion in June 2023 to Tk 3.45 trillion in November, Tk 3.51 trillion in December and Tk 3.63 trillion in January 2024.\n\nAlthough the figure dropped slightly to Tk 3.0 trillion in February, it remained high at Tk 3.11 trillion in March 2024.\n\nEmranul Huq, Managing Director and CEO of Dhaka Bank, said credit demand remains low due to a recent decline in port-import finance and offshore banking finance.\n\n\"These factors could be behind the improvement in the two liquidity indicators,\" Mr Huq told the FE.\n\nMirza Elias Uddin Ahmed, a top executive at Jamuna Bank, admitted the fact that the banking sector has sufficient surplus liquidity overall. Still, some banks with high non-performing loans (NPLs) face liquidity crunch because they cannot access credit from interbank sources.\n\n\"These banks desperately need central bank funding. Otherwise, the overall liquidity situation in the industry is currently good,\" he added.\n\nA senior executive from a private commercial bank, who wished to remain anonymous, said banks have increased their investments in government securities due to the attractive returns offered by treasury bills and bonds.\n\nThe currency swap arrangement launched in late February has also provided banks with significant amounts of cash, further improving the liquidity situation in the banking system, he added.", "source": {"uri": "thefinancialexpress.com.bd", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jubair_hasan@thefinancialexpress.com.bd", "name": "Jubair Hasan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_taka", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi taka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Financial_Express_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Financial Express (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_swap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency swap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offshore bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-performing_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-performing loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://tfe-bd.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/posts/48956/1536853979.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693545", "eventUri": "eng-9693545", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

the Finance Bill 2024 on Saturday while retaining in it the controversial provision of legalising undeclared wealth by paying a flat 15 per cent tax facing no question about its sources.\n\nHowever, finance minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali had to withdraw a major proposal of imposing 30 per cent tax on individuals annually earning more than Tk 25 lakh facing opposition from the prime minister.\n\nThe diplomat-turned-finance-minister's proposal for imposition of a 25 per cent duty on the import of cars by lawmakers was automatically cancelled because of legal complications regarding amendment of the Members of Parliament (Remuneration & Allowances) Order 1973, said finance ministry officials.\n\nParliament members have been enjoying the duty-free car import facilities for the past 36 years resulting in huge revenue losses for the government.\n\nBesides, two proposals, one for cutting tax holiday facilities for investors in high-tech parks and special economic and export processing zones, and another for imposition of duty on the import of raw materials and capital machinery, were also dropped.\n\nPrime minister Sheikh Hasina, while participating on the budget discussion, supported the legalisation of the undisclosed money provision saying that it was not black money.\n\nShe noted that as prices of everything increased, an owner of mere one katha land in Dhaka became the possessor of several crore of taka.\n\n'The generation of extra money could not be shown in the income tax,' said the prime minister, adding that the scope would allow them to legalise the undisclosed gains and become regular taxpayers.\n\nSheikh Hasina said that former prime minister Khaleda Zia and former finance minister M Saiur Rahman availed such amnesty in the past.\n\nIndicating to GM Quader, opposition leader in parliament, the prime minister further said that if former president HM Ershad legalised undisclosed assets needed to be checked.\n\nEarlier, GM Quader in his speech criticised the controversial provision saying that the unethical scope would increase the generation of undisclosed money and encourage corruption.\n\nThe prime minister also opposed imposition of 30 per cent income tax on rich people saying that the payment of extra tax for the previous income year in the new financial year would not acceptable.\n\nAs a result, the highest tax rate remains at 25 per cent as before.\n\nThe tax free ceiling will be Tk 3,50,000, and for next Tk 1 lakh the tax is 5 per cent, for the next Tk 4 lakh the tax rate is 10 per cent, for the next Tk 5 lakh the tax rate is 15 per cent, for next Tk 5 lakh the rate is 20 per cent and for the rest it is 25 per cent.\n\nThe highest income tax slab rate of 30 per cent is likely to impose from FY26.\n\nThe proposal of imposition of 30 per cent tax on individuals making income of more Tk 25 lakh was aimed at checking growing income inequality, while the proposal for cutting tax holiday facilities for investors at high-tech parks and special economic and export processing zones was aimed at mobilising higher revenue.\n\nThe country's tax-GDP is one of the lowest in the world.\n\nThe finance minister accepted 16 proposals on the Finance Bill, while 11 other amendment proposals were rejected by a voice vote.\n\nAs per the amendments, the companies have been relieved of paying surcharge for owning multiple vehicles.\n\nHowever, the provision has been remained valid for individuals.\n\nIncome from the universal pension scheme will be tax free while individuals, companies and trusts have to pay 15 per cent gain tax.\n\nThe finance minister also retained imposition of a 15 per cent tax on capital gains exceeding Tk 50 lakh for beneficiaries in the share business despite strong opposition by the businesses. .\n\nThe finance minister while replying to the demands raised by the lawmakers said that the main aim of his budget proposal was to bring down inflation at 6.5 per cent in FY25.\n\nDescribing the background for proposing a contractionary budget, he said they might overcome the current downturn soon to go for 7 per cent GDP growth in the medium term.\n\nThe passage of the finance bill will allow the government to collect revenue against the projection of Tk 5.41 lakh crore and the projected GDPO growth of 6.75 per cent in FY25.\n\nOf the overall revenue, the National Board of Revenue has been asked to collect Tk 4.80 lakh crore.\n\nThe finance minister also projected a 4.6 per cent budget deficit to be made up mostly by borrowing from banks.\n\nThe Annual Development Programme has been set at Tk 2.65 lakh crore in FY 25.\n\nThe appropriation bill is expected to be passed in Jatiya Sangsad today to authorise ministries and divisions to spend overall Tk 7.79 lakh crore in FY25, as projected by the finance minister while announcing the national budget.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most

has recently allowed Janata Bank to grant over Tk 479 crore in loans to Beximco Group, despite the group's previous outstanding loans to the bank reaching nearly 950 per cent of its paid-up capital in gross violation of rules.\n\nThe BB allowed the fresh loan for the group from Janata Bank under special consideration shortly after uncovering the group's previous loan amount in the bank totalling Tk 21,978 crore.\n\nRecently, Janata Bank forwarded a detailed breakdown of funded and non-funded loans obtained by the 29 companies of the Beximco Group over the years to the central bank.\n\nBB officials said that these loans were initially not attributed to any specific group and claimed that they were not previously informed of these loans prior to this development.\n\nBangladesh Bank spokesperson and executive director Md Mezbaul Haque told New Age in the past week that the central bank recently compiled the total loans provided by Janata Bank to Beximco Group.\n\nHe said that the central bank had asked Janata Bank to reduce the group's loan amounts and prohibited exceeding the current levels.\n\nFurthermore, BB instructed the lender to expedite the loan repayment to curtail the outstanding loan balance to a specified threshold, he said.\n\nHe, however, did not elaborate on the threshold.\n\nAccording to BB officials, despite repeated requests for comprehensive information, Janata Bank failed to furnish the required data concerning the group's loans.\n\nUpon finally receiving details about the liabilities of different companies linked to the group, the central bank found that BEXIMCO Limited and its affiliated firms had funded liabilities of Tk 21,612 crore and total liabilities of Tk 21,978 crore in the bank as of June 30, 2023.\n\nA report compiled by BB found that the Beximco Group's loan amount in Janata Bank stood at 949.78 per cent of the bank's paid-up capital of Tk 2,314 crore.\n\nBanking experts termed the situation a clear violation of banking regulations.\n\nAccording to BB rules, the total loan exposure to a single person or group cannot exceed 25 per cent of the capital held by banks at any point.\n\nThe term group includes any borrower and any other person, organisation, or company involved directly or indirectly with that person whose financial well-being affects the financial condition of others or whose liabilities or advantages fall on others because of the existing relationships between them, as per the rules.\n\nThe central bank imposes single-party exposure limits on banks' loan issuance to reduce the risks associated with lending to a single borrower or closely related group.\n\nThese limits encourage risk diversification, prevent systemic risk, and promote responsible lending practices by ensuring that a bank's exposure to any one borrower remains within manageable levels, experts said.\n\nAdding to the gravity of the situation, the Beximco Group has been granted another loan facility of Tk 479.36 crore at a board meeting of Janata Bank held on July 18, 2023.\n\nConsidering the latest amount, the total debt of Beximco in Janata Bank has now reached Tk 22,304 crore, equivalent to 963 per cent of the bank's paid-up capital.\n\nMd Abdul Jabber, the managing director and chief executive officer of Janata Bank, told New Age that the loans associated with Beximco Group had been consistently regular.\n\n'We are not worried about the group's loans,' he said.\n\nHe suggested that Beximco Group held a significant position in the business landscape and had long been a client of the bank.\n\nBefore allowing fresh loans, Bangladesh Bank's department of off-site supervision opined that the conditions laid out in a Memorandum of Understanding signed earlier with various banks, including state-run Sonali, Janata, Agrani, and Rupali, were applicable uniformly to all clients.\n\nAs waiving any condition from the MOU for a specific client would be 'unreasonable', the department in its report said that Beximco Group could be issued the fresh amount considering its contribution to export business and 'resolving the foreign exchange crisis.'\n\nVarious companies under the group, such as Crescent Fashions and Design, International Knitwear and Apparels Ltd, International Knitwear and Apparels Ltd, Unit-2, and New Dacca Industries Ltd, held funded liabilities of Tk 1,293 crore, Tk 1,667 crore, Tk 1,667 crore, and Tk 788 crore, respectively, the BB compilation report said.\n\nThe loans extended to the group turned 'non-conforming' as Janata Bank's capital dwindled after the MOU was signed with Bangladesh Bank, it said.\n\nWhen a client's loan becomes non-conforming, no additional loans can be sanctioned, but existing loans can be renewed, according to the BB report.\n\nBankers say that a non-conforming loan is a loan that fails to meet bank criteria for funding.\n\nThe BB report said that Janata Bank broke the rules by approving additional loans to these enterprises before the central bank allowed the loan under special consideration.\n\nOf the additional Tk 479.36 crore loans, Janata Bank in the board meeting approved back-to-back LC and packing credits of Tk 53.31 crore to Crescent Fashions, Tk 59.77 crore to International Knitwear and Apparels, Tk 60 crore to New Dacca Industries, and Tk 61 crore to Shinepukur Ceramics.\n\nBesides, BEXIMCO Ltd was given approval for short-term advances totalling Tk 245 crore for back-to-back LC, export bills, and certificate purchases.\n\nAsked for comment, Beximco Group responded through Impact PR, which, in an email signed by its chief executive officer, Sabrina Zaman, clarified that these loans had been acquired over several decades, some dating back to the companies' inception.\n\n'These individual companies had been conducting businesses and borrowing from banks and repaying loans as part of day-to-day business and banks had also been benefitted by the performances of these individual companies which is normal course of business,' said the email.\n\n'Bangladesh Bank through a recent directive asked all Nationalised Commercial Banks (NCBs) to calculate their single borrower exposure limit on the basis of paid-up capital in lieu of total capital.\n\n'Following the directive, Beximco Group needed an exemption from JB as well as BB, since it fell short in maintaining the single borrower exposure limit after the new directive came into effect.\n\n'Accordingly, Beximco Group through JB applied to BB for an exemption and after due consideration, BB gave the required exemption to Beximco with a condition that the total outstanding should not be exceeded and should be brought within the limit by 30 December 2024,' read the email.\n\nIt claimed that similar exemptions have been provided to many others in the past, which is a common banking practice.\n\nThe group's PR agent said that Tk 479 crore in loans to five associated firms are included in the Tk 22,000 crore total and have been taken to finance exports.\n\n'No new loans were sanctioned nor was any approval sought from BB for new loans,' it said.\n\nOn August 29, Beximco Group's vice chairman, Salman F Rahman, shared on his verified Facebook page that Beximco had taken loans from Janata Bank at different times in accordance with the rules to run the business and was also repaying those loans according to the conditions.\n\nThe total non-performing loans of Janata Bank soared to around Tk 14,887 crore at the end of March from Tk 14,386 crore in December, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the bank's NPL on total loan distribution reached 17.46 per cent in March, according to Bangladesh Bank data.

We have tried our best to accomplish the work, and now people will judge our effort,\" Project Director Shafiqul Islam told The Daily Star today.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina will formally conclude the project through a programme at Mawa end of the bridge on July 5, he said.\n\nWhen the project was taken in August 2007, the cost of the project was Tk 10,161 crore and it was supposed to be implemented with foreign loan.\n\nThe project went through a major revision in January 2011, when the rail line was incorporated into the bridge, bringing the project cost to Tk 20,507 crore.\n\nThe project went through several revisions afterwards and the cost rose to Tk 32,605 crore. However, some Tk 1600 crore may not be required, Shafiqul said, adding that the cost of the project would be around Tk 31,000 crore.\n\nThe project has made headlines many times.\n\nThe cancellation of World Bank loan, changes in bridge design and the pandemic shrouded uncertainty over the long-cherished project but the project was completed with the government's funds, directly connecting the capital with the southwestern region.\n\n\"People are benefiting from the project. If we can maintain the project properly, it will survive for 100 years,\" Shafiqul Islam said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Padma Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_taka", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi taka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Trick_Capturing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Trick Capturing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Toll_and_Automated", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Toll and Automated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/04/01/padma_bridge.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693545", "eventUri": "eng-9693545", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 57, "textEnd": 63, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 483, "textEnd": 490}, {"amb": false, "date": "2007-08-", "textStart": 163, "textEnd": 174, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-01-", "textStart": 1079, "textEnd": 1091}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

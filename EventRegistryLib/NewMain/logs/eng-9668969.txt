SOULM8TE is a spinoff of the horror hit M3GAN , promising an erotic thriller in a futuristic setting. Universal Pictures has already set a release date of Jan. 2, 2026, so mark your calendars for this new chapter in the M3GAN universe.\n\nMore deadly robots will be coming to the big screen soon. Atomic Monster and Blumhouse are currently developing SOULM8TE, a spinoff from their smash-hit horror film M3GAN, according to Deadline. The film, described as an erotic thriller set in a futuristic world, will serve as a new chapter in the so-called 'M3GAN universe,' and Universal Pictures has already dated it for a theatrical release on Jan. 2, 2026.\n\nPlot details on SOULM8TE remain few and far between. However, the film will follow a man who acquires an Artificially Intelligent android to cope with the loss of his recently deceased wife, according to a logline from Universal. In an attempt to create a truly sentient partner, he inadvertently turns a harmless lovebot into a deadly soulmate. The film is also being described as having a similar feeling to classic 1990s erotic thrillers with a modern twist. No casting for the film has been announced yet.\n\nSOULM8TE will be directed by Kate Dolan from a re-written script by Rafael Jordan, with a story from Jordan, Ingrid Bisu, and Atomic Monster head James Wan. Wan will also produce the film for Atomic Monster alongside Blumhouse's Jason Blum. Atomic Monster's Michael Clear and Judson Scott will executive produce alongside Ingrid Bisu. \"SOULM8TE is a thrilling and seductive addition to the M3GAN universe. We're excited to partner with Kate to bring this story to life with her unique cinematic vision and point of view,\" Wan said in a statement.\n\n'M3GAN' Became a Massive Hit\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Universal, Atomic Monster and Blumhouse are looking to expand the M3GAN franchise, given the critical success of the first film. The film starred Allison Williams as a roboticist who brings home a prototype android doll named M3GAN (Amie Donald), for her niece Cady to have as a friend. However, things start to go badly when M3GAN develops advanced intelligence and begins going to extreme lengths to protect Cady - including going after the people closest to her. The film became one of the first sleeper hits of 2023 and grossed $181 million at the global box office against a reported budget of just $12 million.\n\nM3GAN performed so well that a sequel, M3GAN 2, was green-lit by Universal just weeks after the first film hit theaters, and is slated for a June 27, 2025.

So it came as no shock when they fast-tracked a sequel, M3GAN 2.0. Now, a spin-off of M3GAN is on its way as well, as Atomic Monster, Blumhouse, and Universal are developing SOULM8TE, a new film expanding on the M3GAN universe. SOULM8TE releases in theaters on January 2, 2026. Described as a throwback '90s style erotic thriller with a technological twist, Kate Dolan will direct the film. The original script is by Rafael Jordan, with the story by James Wan, Ingrid Bisu, and Jordan.\n\nAccording to the official description for SOULM8TE, the story centers on a man who acquires an artificially intelligent android to cope with the loss of his recently deceased wife. In an attempt to create a truly sentient partner, he inadvertently turns a seemingly harmless robot into a deadly soulmate. In short, it sounds like it's Fatal Attraction meets Short Circuit. And we're totally here for that. We're not entirely sure how much the world of this movie will actually connect to M3GAN, although we are hoping we see her pop up in some capacity. M3GAN 2.0 will arrive in theaters first, on June 27, 2025.\n\nWe hope that SOULM8TE is the kind of campy fun that M3GAN was, only with a more R-rated adult skew. Back in the '80s, and especially the '90s, the erotic thriller was one of the top genres at the worldwide box office. Movies like Basic Instinct enthralled audiences everywhere with their sexy suspense stories. Ok, so they were a little ridiculous too, which is why we still love them. Maybe for today's audience, the only way to truly bring the genre back is to have an erotic killer robot.

Get ready for M3GAN 2.0 as Gemma and Cady return in an epic sequel exploring deeper AI issues, set for release in 2025.\n\nThe M3GAN universe is expanding with a spinoff entitled SOULM8TE, but this extension of the franchise sounds like it might be a bit more adult than the artificially intelligent doll that was created to be the friend and companion of a little girl.\n\nPer Deadline, James Wan's Atomic Monster banner and Blumhouse Productions have developed a spinoff of the M3GAN universe called SOULM8TE, which is being touted as a 1990s erotic thriller \"with a new technological twist.\" The film already has a release date, expected to kick off the New Year on January 2, 2026. Kate Dolan is set to direct the feature from a screenplay whose original draft she rewrote by Rafael Jordan. Story credit goes to Wan, Ingrid Bisu, and Jordan, while Wan is also on board as a producer alongside Jason Blum, with Michael Clear and Judson Scott from Atomic Monster serving as executive producers. The film's synopsis can be viewed below.\n\n\"In SOULM8TE, a man acquires an Artificially Intelligent android to cope with the loss of his recently deceased wife.

The film follows Gemma (Alison Williams), a roboticist who covertly creates a humanoid robot called M3GAN (Model 3 Generative Android) to be the perfect companion for little kids. M3GAN at first seems like the perfect friend for her niece Cady (Violet McGraw), whose parents were killed in a car accident and is now living with Gemma. While M3GAN appears to make Cady socialize again, the doll powered by artificial intelligence becomes hostile to anyone who comes between her and Cady.\n\nM3GAN became a surprise hit with critics and audiences, becoming one of the best-reviewed films of 2022 on Rotten Tomatoes with a score of 93 percent, which is particularly stellar for a horror movie. M3GAN ultimately grossed $95 million domestically and $181 million worldwide on a slim $12 million budget.\n\nRelated M3GAN 2: James Wan Teases an Epic Return for the Killer Doll\n\nJames Wan shares plot details for M3GAN 2.0, teasing a deeper exploration of AI issues.\n\nThe success of M3GAN only made a sequel inevitable and it was so announced that M3GAN 2.0 was in active development.

In an attempt to create a truly sentient partner, he inadvertently turns a harmless lovebot into a deadly soulmate.\" Think '90s thrillers like Fatal Attraction and Single White Female, but updated with a tech vibe.\n\nThe film is set to be helmed by Kate Dolan (You Are Not My Mother) who also re-worked a script by Rafael Jordan with a story by James Wan, Ingrid Bisu, and Jordan. \"Soulm8te is a thrilling and seductive addition to the M3GAN universe,\" Wan said in the trade. \"We're excited to partner with Kate to bring this story to life with her unique cinematic vision and point of view.\"", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3GAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M3GAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumhouse_Productions", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blumhouse Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(robot)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Android (robot)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Monster_Productions", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atomic Monster Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Attraction_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatal Attraction (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_Bisu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ingrid Bisu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Wan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/8ad1153fa965b8264fa25c1d79a4a6f0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668969", "eventUri": "eng-9668969", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Soulm8te, a techno-based erotic thriller, will be about a man who turns to an AI-powered sex robot \"to cope with the loss of his dead wife.\" As one imagines, things go awry when someone sets his doll to evil, inadvertently turning this \"harmless lovebot into a deadly soulmate.\" That all sounds well and good, but how could they botch the title? It should be spelled Soulm8.\n\nM3GAN rolled off the tongue. It had the meme-inspiring cache being a horror movie with a mundane woman's name as its title. The added \"3\" built on its campy fun. We all know this is kind of dumb, but it's dumb in the right way. Not only was this a movie about an evil little doll named M3GAN, but characters and fans could also get pedantic with it. The people referring to it as \"M-three-gan\" always get a kick over taking the veritable scenic route on the title. But Soulm8te? Does anyone look forward to saying \"Soulm-eight-te\"?

Lovebot - SlashFilm", "body": "The \"M3GAN\" universe is expanding beyond the pint-sized killer bestie for children, and giving something wild as hell for adult viewers who need something a little stronger than a cartwheel and a creepy rendition of David Guetta and Sia's \"Titanium\" to give them a good scare. As was announced today, Blumhouse Productions and James Wan's Atomic Monster are currently developing \"SOULM8TE,\" a 1990s-style erotic thriller \"with a new technological twist.\" We have been in a drought of good erotic thrillers for years, so this announcement is exciting, overdue, and exactly the type of project Blumhouse needs to get audiences hyped after this lackluster 2024. Here's the film's very intriguing synopsis:\n\nIn \"SOULM8TE,\" a man acquires an Artificially Intelligent android to cope with the loss of his recently deceased wife. In an attempt to create a truly sentient partner, he inadvertently turns a harmless lovebot into a deadly soulmate.\n\nFolks have already pointed out the similarities to the \"Black Mirror\" episode \"Be Right Back\" with Hayley Atwell and Domhnall Gleeson, but everyone is forgetting that both \"M3GAN\" and the erotic thrillers of the 1990s are wildly different in tone from the bleak, heartbreaking sorrow presented in \"Be Right Back.\" Erotic thrillers mean \"Basic Instinct\" or \"Fatal Attraction,\" so this AI lovebot could be threatening to kill people with ice picks or boiling pet rabbits -- and since it's going to be given the modern, technological twist, I won't be surprised if the android will also be bisexual, eat hot chip, and lie. I want to see an android with jealousy go full \"Smart House\" in a rated-R sexy horror film, damn it!

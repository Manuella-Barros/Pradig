Last week in Paris, Chinese weapons manufacturer, North Industries Group Corporation (Norinco), showcased miniature versions of its land-based weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at the Eurosatory expo, one of Europe\u2019s biggest arms shows. Norinco displayed various rotary and fixed-wing UAVs at its booth, including the Z-6B, an unmanned helicopter system based on the Z-6 helicopter from the 1960s, which can do vertical take-offs and landings, making it suitable for large naval platforms, such as aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, and destroyers. \u201cThe Z-6B features many technological innovations compared to the original Z-6,\u201d said Timothy Heath, a senior international defence researcher at the Rand Corporation think tank. \u201cIn addition to being unmanned, it features improvements in stealth, advanced optical sensors, electromagnetic warfare, and attack capabilities. \u201cIt is a multi-role platform capable of surveillance, targeting support, and anti-submarine warfare, among other missions.\u201d Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the Z-6B was \u201cvery reminiscent\u201d of US defence contractor Northrop Grumman\u2019s MQ-8B Fire Scout, but with greater payload, a higher operational ceiling, and greater endurance. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to be employed to support naval operations at sea, including ISR [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] communications support for targeting of over-the-horizon weapons, and perhaps logistics support, or from the shore, and clearly employs a degree of reduced radar cross section in its design,\u201d he said. Norinco\u2019s emphasis on drones at the exhibition was a sign that military UAVs had become one of China\u2019s core military exports. According to an arms transfer database from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China was the world\u2019s fourth biggest arms exporter in 2023. However, its deliveries were mainly limited to developing countries in Africa and Asia, where Pakistan accounted for 61 per cent of total arms exports. Drones have been a major source of growth for China\u2019s arms exports. The SIPRI database also showed that Beijing exported more than 280 combat drones over the past decade, mainly to the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia. \u201cThe rapid development and export of low-cost military UAVs in the past few years, for applications such as surveillance and attack, has played a significant role in the growth of China\u2019s arms industry and is expected to continue in the future as well,\u201d said Nishant Kumar, a senior analyst for air platforms at global military intelligence company Janes. Serbia is the only European country operating Chinese UAVs in its military. In 2020, Beijing delivered six Chinese-made CH-92A combat drones along with 18 FT-8C laser-guided missiles to Belgrade. Three years later, Serbia acquired Chinese CH-95 UAVs. Mark Cozad, a senior international defence researcher at Rand Corporation, said China had made the development of drone technology a \u201cnational priority\u201d, and there had been significant growth in Chinese companies developing and marketing both commercial and military drones. He said drones were an \u201cimportant part\u201d of China\u2019s arms industry, particularly in the sales to the Middle East and North Africa, providing a wide range of services and capabilities at lower costs compared to their Western counterparts. \u201cOverall, China has developed a wide array of technologically capable drones for use in both [commercial and military] areas,\u201d Cozad said. \u201cWestern systems cost significantly more for both purchases but also in terms of operations and maintenance costs. For customers \u2026 the low cost is a critical factor.\u201d The Russian invasion of Ukraine highlighted the importance of military UAVs in modern warfare for their low cost and high efficiency, while reducing the risks of human casualties. \u201cThis war shows that drones change everything \u2026 Now, Ukraine is producing FPV [first-person view] drones, medicines drones, [and] maritime drones,\u201d said Maksym Zaporozhets, international sales manager at drone manufacturer Ukrspec Systems, one of the Ukrainian companies showcasing products at Eurosatory. UAVs were among the biggest drawcards of the advanced weapons systems at the show, with leading Western defence contractors also showcasing their drone technologies. Outside the exhibition hall, Europe\u2019s largest aircraft maker, Airbus, promoted its rotary UAV, the VSR700, which is based on a twin-seat design from French helicopter maker Guimbal. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a good solution because it has the qualities of a small helicopter \u2026 [but] you can carry quite a large payload. So you can imagine a lot of different mission sets,\u201d Airbus Helicopter\u2019s Emmanuel Huberdeau said, adding that his company aims to deliver the system to the French navy by 2025. France\u2019s Ministry of Armed Forces showcased a mock-up of French aerospace company Safran\u2019s medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle SDT Patroller at its Eurosatory booth. Cozad said while it was unlikely that Chinese military drones would find many \u201cinroads\u201d in Europe because of issues such as \u201cinteroperability, security, reliability and dependence\u201d on China, the \u201cintegral\u201d role of UAVs in Ukraine would enhance Chinese units as \u201cattractive options\u201d for developing countries. \u201cDrones have proven their value in a variety of capacities over the past 30 years as ISR platforms, communications relays, and as weapons systems among others,\u201d Cozad said. \u201cAs a part of foreign military sales, China provides attractive options to many militaries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. They provide good enough capabilities for a price that these militaries can afford and with little to no restrictions on their use.\u201d Lukas Fiala, project coordinator of China Foresight, at the London School of Economics, agreed that Europe would \u201cnot be a key market for China\u201d in UAV exports, given \u201cobvious political constraints\u201d, but it would find more opportunities in the Global South, even though it may also face competition from other arms exporters such as Turkey. \u201cWith drones, one of the key focal points of the Russian war in Ukraine, there will be continued interest in such systems for the foreseeable future,\u201d Fiala said. \u201cWhether China will be in a position to take advantage of this will depend not only on external competition, but also on the willingness of Chinese firms to offer competitively priced package deals, including training, weapons systems and maintenance, repair and overhaul services.\u201d", "summary": "At one of Europe\u2019s biggest defence shows, Chinese military drones are on the radar as \u2018low cost\u2019 commercial and military alternatives.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3268149/drones-change-everything-china-showcases-uav-competitive-edge-military-export-market", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/26/858e25be-bf3d-4a30-9d5b-6e84213c071d_f656584f.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:00:17", "author": "Seong Hyeon Choi", "authors": ["Seong Hyeon Choi"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.373}

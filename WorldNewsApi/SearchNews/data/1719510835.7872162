During this time, Ukraine was attempting to wage its summer counteroffensive which ultimately failed.Researchers collected data on the use of some 3,000 Excalibur shells fired by American-supplied M777 howitzers on the front lines in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, the northern city of Kharkiv, and the eastern city of Bakhmut.According to a person familiar with the report who spoke to The Times, at one point, only one in 19 Excalibur rounds was hitting its target.One of the classified reports stated that at this rate, the price of a successful strike increased from $300,000 to $1.9 million.When first delivered, the M982 Excalibur shells were hailed as a game changer for Ukraine. The GPS-guided 155 mm shells offered an accurate, longer-range alternative to conventional artillery shells, capable of hitting within seven feet of their target.The Excalibur has a range of 25 miles, according to Pentagon budget documents from 2022 that first confirmed the shells had been sent to Ukraine.The HIMARS system, which can fire rockets up to 50 miles, has also been hampered by Russian jamming, a Ukrainian military source told The Post.\"The Russians deployed electronic warfare, disabled satellite signals, and HIMARS became completely ineffective,\" the source told The Post. According to the assessment, Russian jamming can cause the missiles to miss a target by 50 feet or more.The HIMARS system, which can fire rockets up to 50 miles, has also been hampered by Russian jamming, a Ukrainian military source told The Post.\"The Russians deployed electronic warfare, disabled satellite signals, and HIMARS became completely ineffective,\" the source told the Post. According to the assessment, Russian jamming can cause the missiles to miss a target by 50 feet or more.Earlier this week, a report revealed that US-supplied glide bombs were continually missing their targets as a result of Russian jamming, too.A senior US official, who was not named, told the Post that Russia \"has continued to expand their use of electronic warfare, and we continue to evolve and make sure that Ukraine has the capabilities they need to be effective.\"However, earlier this month Mike Nagata, a retired US Army lieutenant general who led special operations in the Middle East, said that the US is \"still falling behind\" in its electronic warfare capabilities, Defense One reported.\"The gap between where the United States should be and where we are, in my judgment, continues to expand not everywhere, but in far too many places,\" Nagata said at the SOF Week conference in Tampa, Florida.He called on the US to get more creative to regain its dominance in electronic warfare.", "summary": "The US halted Excalibur-guided artillery shell deliveries to Ukraine after Kyiv reported high failure rates caused by Russia's electronic jamming.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/us-gave-up-sending-ukraine-100k-excalibur-shells-hit-targets-2024-5", "image": "https://i.insider.com/66532085239fda2da6cbd407?width=1136&format=jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:03:24", "author": "Cameron Manley", "authors": ["Cameron Manley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.327}

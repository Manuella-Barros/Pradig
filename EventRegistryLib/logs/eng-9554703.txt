For most people, the charge will be $24.15 per month and it will pay for installing and maintaining the equipment necessary to transmit electricity to homes. Residents with lower incomes who are enrolled in one of two discount programs will pay less, either $6 or $12 per month.\n\nAlso see: Electric bills could rise for those in cooler coastal climes under new plan\n\nIn exchange for the new charge, the price of electricity will drop by between 5 cents and 7 cents per kilowatt hour. One kilowatt hour is how much power it takes to use a 1,000-watt appliance -- a coffee maker or vacuum cleaner, for instance -- for one hour.\n\nThe change will take effect late next year for customers of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. It will take effect in early 2026 for Pacific Gas & Electric customers.\n\nThe change comes as California grapples with what consumer advocates have called an affordability crisis for the state's utility customers, who now on average face the second-highest power rates in the country.\n\nRates have doubled for many customers, who are paying for utilities to spend billions of dollars to update their aging grids and work on reducing the risk of their power lines sparking more catastrophic wildfires.\n\nFor people who use a lot of energy each month, this will lower their monthly bills. People who live in Fresno -- where temperatures can often exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit -- would save about $33 running their air conditioners during the summer, according to the commission. That's because the savings they get from the price drop on electricity will be more than the amount they pay for the new fixed charge.\n\nIt will also benefit people who own electric cars and use other electric appliances, such as heat pumps. They will save an average of between $28 and $44 per month, according to the commission. In 2022, California accounted for 37% of the nation's light-duty electric vehicles, or about six times more than Florida, the state in second place, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n\"It provides affordability for lower-income Californians and those living in other parts of the state most impacted by extreme weather,\" California Public Utilities Commission President Alice Busching Reynolds said.\n\nFor people who don't use as much energy, the new fixed charge could increase their bill each month. This includes people who live in smaller apartments or who live in cooler areas and don't use air conditioning as much. That's because for them, the decrease in the price of electricity would not be enough to offset the amount of the new monthly charge.\n\nOpponents argue it would act as a disincentive to conserve energy, something California has been urging people to do.\n\n\"If you wanted to design a policy instrument that would send the signal that conservation doesn't count, this would be it,\" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group.\n\nMost states already have fixed monthly charges on utility bills to pay for maintenance and infrastructure of the electric grid. But in California -- where electric rates are among the highest in the nation -- any move that could increase prices for anyone raises alarms among consumers and elected officials.\n\nA group of 18 members of Congress from California have called on the commission to keep the rate low, noting the national average for fixed charges on utility bills is $11. Some Democrats and Republicans in the state Legislature have backed a bill that would cap the charge at $10 per month.\n\n\"We must do more to rein in the ever-growing cost of living in our state, not find new ways to add to it,\" Republicans in the California Senate wrote in a letter urging the commission to reject the proposal.\n\nThe proposal is much lower than what the state's investor-owned utility companies had asked for, which was a charge between $53 and $71 per month. The commission also argues the charge would not discourage conservation, noting utilities are already allowed to increase rates during peak hours.\n\nUtilities have supported the idea of raising fixed monthly fees as a way to more evenly distribute its infrastructure costs among customers. The fixed charges would be near the top of those imposed by investor-owned utilities, according to an analysis by Ahmad Faruqui, a utility rate expert.", "source": {"uri": "redlandsdailyfacts.com",

For most people, the charge will be $24.15 per month and it will pay for installing and maintaining the equipment necessary to transmit electricity to homes. Residents with lower incomes who are enrolled in one of two discount programs will pay less, either $6 or $12 per month.\n\nAlso see: Electric bills could rise for those in cooler coastal climes under new plan\n\nIn exchange for the new charge, the price of electricity will drop by between 5 cents and 7 cents per kilowatt hour. One kilowatt hour is how much power it takes to use a 1,000-watt appliance -- a coffee maker or vacuum cleaner, for instance -- for one hour.\n\nThe change will take effect late next year for customers of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. It will take effect in early 2026 for Pacific Gas & Electric customers.\n\nFor people who use a lot of energy each month, this will lower their monthly bills. People who live in Fresno -- where temperatures can often exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) -- would save about $33 running their air conditioners during the summer, according to the commission. That's because the savings they get from the price drop on electricity will be more than the amount they pay for the new fixed charge.\n\nIt will also benefit people who own electric cars and use other electric appliances, such as heat pumps. They will save an average of between $28 and $44 per month, according to the commission. In 2022, California accounted for 37% of the nation's light-duty electric vehicles, or about six times more than Florida, the state in second place, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n\"It provides affordability for lower-income Californians and those living in other parts of the state most impacted by extreme weather,\" California Public Utilities Commission President Alice Busching Reynolds said.\n\nFor people who don't use as much energy, the new fixed charge could increase their bill each month. This includes people who live in smaller apartments or who live in cooler areas and don't use air conditioning as much. That's because for them, the decrease in the price of electricity would not be enough to offset the amount of the new monthly charge.\n\nOpponents argue it would act as a disincentive to conserve energy, something California has been urging people to do.\n\n\"If you wanted to design a policy instrument that would send the signal that conservation doesn't count, this would be it,\" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group.\n\nMost states already have fixed monthly charges on utility bills to pay for maintenance and infrastructure of the electric grid. But in California -- where electric rates are among the highest in the nation -- any move that could increase prices for anyone raises alarms among consumers and elected officials.\n\nA group of 18 members of Congress from California have called on the commission to keep the rate low, noting the national average for fixed charges on utility bills is $11. Some Democrats and Republicans in the state Legislature have backed a bill that would cap the charge at $10 per month.\n\n\"We must do more to rein in the ever-growing cost of living in our state, not find new ways to add to it,\" Republicans in the California Senate wrote in a letter urging the commission to reject the proposal.\n\nThe proposal is much lower than what the state's investor-owned utility companies had asked for, which was a charge between $53 and $71 per month. The commission also argues the charge would not discourage conservation, noting utilities are already allowed to increase rates during peak hours.\n\nUtilities have supported the idea of raising fixed monthly fees as a way to more evenly distribute its infrastructure costs among customers. The fixed charges would be near the top of those imposed by investor-owned utilities, according to an analysis by Ahmad Faruqui, a utility rate expert.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com",

It applies to all customers, regardless of how much electricity they consume. Opponents of the rate case argue that it will discourage energy conservation and efficiency at home. Grid expert and economist Ahmad Faruqui said the charge will disproportionately harm customers with low electric bills.\n\nA major concern about the fixed charge, first introduced in California AB 205, is that it places no limit on how much the state's largest investor-owned utilities can increase the fixed charge. Consumer and environmental advocates attempted to place a cap on the fixed charge at $10 per month, and despite the bill's popularity, it was blocked from advancing to the committee for a vote.\n\n\"What is $24 today will turn into $80 tomorrow,\" warned the Coalition for Environmental Equity and Economics.\n\nEarlier proposals from California utilities proposed a fixed charge as high as $128 per month, and the door is now open for utilities to pursue these high charges. Upon the vote, CPUC said there needs to be \"scrutiny\" on future utility requests for increases to fixed charges, but language in the proposed decision creates no legal mandate for limiting fixed rate hikes.\n\nOpponents of the rule also argue that the economics of rooftop solar are harmed by the proposal. Even if a customer's rooftop solar array provides 100% of their electricity usage year-round, the fixed charge would apply, offsetting potential bill savings. California has made a series of regulatory and ratemaking changes that have challenged rooftop solar, causing industry leaders to flag concern that California may be off track in meeting its clean energy goals as a result.\n\nCalifornia is currently suffering an electricity affordability crisis. Utility filings show that over 20% of customers of the three large utilities are over a month late on their bills, and that number rises to 33% in low-income brackets. Low-income customers are offered a discount in the monthly discount, so long as they self-attest to their income level in state programs like CARE.\n\nCPUC said the fixed charge will help decouple energy generation charges from transmission, distribution, and grid maintenance charges. Along with the fixed charge, electricity rates for generation, called volumetric rates, will be reduced by about 5 to 7 cents per kilowatt hour.\n\nWhile the volumetric rates have been lowered in this proposal by five to seven cents, this discount is essentially washed out by recent rate increases. PG&E approved a 13% rate hike, in 2024, while the proposed decision is expected to reduce rates by roughly 19%.\n\n(Read: \"California electricity pricing exploded in the last three years, far outpacing inflation\")\n\nPeak demand electricity rates in PG&E currently exceed $0.62 per kWh. A solar and storage industry contact shared that these rates are expected to continue to skyrocket.\n\n\"We have been told every utility has a target to be over $1.00 in the near future for peak, summer rates,\" the contact told pv magazine USA.\n\nThe fixed rate will appear on customer bills in late 2025 for SCE and SDG&E customers and early 2026 for PG&E customers.", "source": {"uri": "pv-magazine-usa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pv magazine USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_kennedy@pv-magazine-usa.com", "name": "Ryan Kennedy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Public_Utilities_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Public Utilities Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftop_solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rooftop solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy conservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-owned_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investor-owned utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lower_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American lower class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peak demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Gas_&_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Gas & Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California_Edison", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California Edison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/digitalmeter.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554703", "eventUri": "eng-9554703", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- California regulators on Thursday voted to make it cheaper for people to charge electric cars and cool their homes in the summer, a decision heralded as part of the state's transition to clean energy but derided by others who warn it will raise prices for people who don't use as much energy.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission voted to let the state's big investor-owned utilities -- including Pacific Gas & Electric -- add a fixed charge to people's power bills each month to pay for installing and maintaining the equipment necessary to transmit electricity to homes.\n\nFor most people, the charge will be $24.15 per month and will take effect starting late next year.

One kilowatt hour is how much power it takes to use a 1,000-watt appliance -- a coffee maker or vacuum cleaner, for instance -- for one hour.\n\nCalifornia now gets most of its energy from things like solar panels and wind turbines as opposed to burning coal and other fossil fuels that pollute the atmosphere. As a result, California's leaders have been asking residents to use more electricity than ever before.\n\nIn 2022, California accounted for 37% of the nation's light-duty electric vehicles, or about six times more than Florida, the state in second place, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state has also pushed policies to encourage people to electrify their homes, like installing electric heat pumps and stoves.\n\n\"We're at a time now when our climate goals are not met by necessarily using less electricity. We need to start using more electricity overall,\" said Alice Reynolds, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.\n\nFor people who use a lot of energy each month, the proposal approved on Thursday will likely lower their monthly bills. People who own electric cars and have electrified their homes will save an average of between $28 and $44 per month, according to the commission. That's because the savings they get from the price drop on electricity will be more than the amount they pay for the new fixed charge.\n\nIt will also benefit people who live in areas where it gets really hot. People in Fresno -- where temperatures can often exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) -- would save about $33 running their air conditioners during the summer, according to the commission.\n\nUsing more electricity has strained the state's supply. In the summer of 2020, demand for electricity was so high that the officials had to order rolling blackouts to make sure the state didn't run out of energy.\n\nState officials have urged people to conserve energy during peak hours, between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. when energy from solar is less abundant. Opponents worry this proposal, by lowering the price for electricity, will discourage people from doing that.\n\n\"If you wanted to design a policy instrument that would send the signal that conservation doesn't count, this would be it,\" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group.\n\nCommissioner John Reynolds noted utility companies are already allowed to increase their rates during peak hours to act as an incentive to conserve.\n\n\"The idea that this fixed charge proposal will undermine the motivation to conserve is, quite frankly, laughable,\" he said. \"It's a simplistic way to view this decision, and we all know that our energy situation and rate design are anything but simple.\"\n\nFor people who don't use as much energy, the new fixed charge could increase their bill each month.

But in California -- where electric rates are among the highest in the nation -- any move that could increase prices for anyone raises alarms among consumers and elected officials.\n\nA bill amended in the state Legislature on Wednesday would limit any increase in the new fixed charge to not more than the increase in inflation. It would also cap the amount of the fixed charge to a maximum of $10 beginning in 2028.\n\n\"We must do more to rein in the ever-growing cost of living in our state, not find new ways to add to it,\"

That rate cut will vary from between 8% and 18%, depending on the utility, season and time of day, according to the commission's analysis.\n\nTo make up for the lost revenue, regulators have introduced the concept of a \"fixed charge,\" a break from California electric billing tradition. For decades electric bills from Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric have been the \"pay as you go\" variety, with households only paying for the electricity they use.\n\nStarting in late 2025 for SCE and SDG&E customers and in early 2026 for those with PG&E, the state's investor-owned utilities will be able to charge customers a monthly fee regardless of how much power the customer draws from the grid. So-called fixed charges are a mainstay of electric billing across most of the country, with an average fee of roughly $11.\n\nThe new California charge will be $24 for most customers, but lower income households, who already qualify for discounted electric rates, will see fees of either $6 or $12.\n\nThe unanimous vote by the California Public Utilities Commission comes after months of heated debate that pitted Assembly and Senate Democrats and Republicans against legislative leadership and the governor's office, advocates of rooftop solar against labor unions representing utility workers and environmental advocates against one another.\n\nBackers of the billing change say it's a necessary step to bring down electricity rates in California, which are among the highest in the country. California regulators want all new cars sold to be electric by 2035 and are taking steps to discourage gas-powered indoor appliances. Those goals are hard to square with sky-high electric prices.\n\nThe state's planned \"transition to all electric homes, cars and trucks is truly transformative,\" said CPUC President Alice Reynolds at today's hearing. Under the proposed change all customers \"will be better off financially if they electrify -- whether that's purchasing an electric vehicle or switching out a gas appliance with an electric one.\"\n\nOpponents argue that the change in billing policy won't move the needle for most households considering dumping their gas-powered cars and appliances, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but will instead needlessly discourage energy conservation efforts while punishing rooftop solar customers.\n\nThe policy is a departure from 50 years of regulatory precedent in California, which is \"if you use more you pay more and that encourages conservation,\" said Loretta Lynch, a former CPUC president and critic of what she sees as a \"pro-utility\" bias on the current body. Reducing the penalty on high energy use will also have \"huge cost consequences down the road\" for a grid that already struggles to keep up with summer-time demand, she said.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the policy change may be more muted than either side wants to admit, said Merideth Fowlie, a UC Berkeley economist and one of a handful of researchers to initially float the idea in 2021 of an income-graduated fixed charge as one way to pay for reduced electricity rates.\n\nThe three-tiered CPUC-approved change doesn't vary much by income and its promised rate reductions are relatively modest, said Fowlie.\n\n\"Clearly, I'm disappointed, because I don't think it comes close to where I think we should be in terms of reductions,\" she said. \"If this forces another conversation -- which is, 'Why are we paying for wildfire risk mitigation, which is essentially climate change adaptation, or some of these major investments in decarbonisation, on bills?' -- I think that's an important conversation to have.\"\n\nThough utilities won't earn any more revenue or profit as a direct result of the change, there will be winners and losers under the new billing program.\n\nThe reduced price of electricity will likely save money for people who use a lot of electricity, such as a large household in an AC-dependent part of the state or the owner of an electric SUV, a heat pump and an induction stove more than enough to offset the cost of the new fee. Many, if not most, low-income households who qualify for the discounted fixed charge will also emerge as financial winners.\n\nBut there are sure to be plenty of losers, too. Smaller households, Californians living along the temperate coast, energy conscious customers and people with solar panels on their rooftops are all more likely to see their total utility bills rise.\n\nThat group makes for a powerful political bloc that has fiercely rallied against the regulatory change for months. Many showed up or called in at the commission hearing.\n\n\"The big utility tax will increase monthly utility bills on four million households while doing nothing to encourage electrification,\" said Yvette DeCarlo, speaking on behalf of a coalition of environmental nonprofits, tenant rights groups, liberal advocacy organizations and anti-tax activists.\n\nSeverin Borenstein, another Berkeley economist who co-authored the 2021 study with Fowlie, said modeling suggests that the lower electricity rates under the policy will only increase electric vehicle purchases by roughly 5% above what they would otherwise be.\n\n\"It's in the right direction, though, and I think that we can't get to where we need to go unless we start,\" he said.\n\nThe fixed charge policy was included in a budget proposal by Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration in 2022, but it wasn't until last year that many state legislators woke up to it. Twenty-one coastal Democrats, led by Thousand Oaks Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, introduced a bill ordering the CPUC to reverse course. So too did Senate Republican leader Brian Jones. Both efforts were quietly put on ice at the behest of legislative leadership.\n\nIn a letter Jones and the rest of the Senate GOP caucus sent to CPUC president Reynolds earlier this week, the San Diego Republican expressed some skepticism that the state regulatory body could be trusted to keep the fixed charge at its current level.\n\n\"We are particularly concerned that this will only be the beginning,\" the letter said. \"The CPUC has been granted unchecked power to increase this new charge at any time. If the $24.15 plan is approved, the next proposal may see the fixed charge hiked to $50, $100, or even higher!\"\n\nFor California's residential solar industry, the vote is just the latest regulatory broadside.\n\nOver the last two years, the CPUC has slashed the payments that utilities are required to give to single family homeowners, apartment buildings, schools and businesses that install solar panels.\n\nThat's based on the argument, advanced by the commission, the regulated utilities and many energy economists, that relatively well-to-do solar customers have been overcompensated in California since the early 2000s, which has had the effect of off-loading the costs of running the grid onto non-solar households.\n\nAdvocates for the fixed charge say assigning solar customers an unavoidable monthly charge is yet another way to balance out who pays for major utility line items like wildfire prevention, subsidies for low income households, EV charging networks and distribution system upkeep.\n\n\"What the fixed charge does is ensure that we're no longer going to have freeloaders,\" Scott Wetch, a lobbyist who represents many unionized workers employed by California's for-profit utility companies, told CalMatters earlier this month.\n\nHomeowners with solar panels were well represented among those who called in to give public comment.\n\n\"I have solar panels on the home, which we've got right away to cooperate with California's move to have 100% renewable energy. But yet we're getting hit with this unfair tax,\" Joy Frew, a self-described senior citizen from San Diego County, told the commission over the phone.\n\n\"People that really invested in solar trying to do the right thing for the planet -- all of a sudden we're being slapped in the face for doing it,\" said a called named Steve Randall from San Clemente.\n\nNot that every Californian with a solar panel above their head is opposed to the fixed charge. Fowlie, one of architects behind the idea, said her family hopped on the solar bandwagon as a way to bring down their monthly utility bill.\n\n\"I'm gonna be the biggest loser under this proposal,\" she said. \"I would be in that higher income bracket and I have solar, so my bills would go up. But I think it's a win for California, so I'm a big supporter.\"", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

CPUC officials will vote on the decision Thursday. If approved, the decision would allow state utility companies to include a fixed charge of $24.15 on each monthly power bill. In return, the utilities would reduce the price of electricity by 5 cents to 7 cents per kilowatt hour, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe price reduction would prove beneficial to households using high amounts of energy each month, such as those living in hotter parts of the state running their air conditioners consistently or those who charge their electric vehicles at home. But for residents who use less energy, it could cause an overall increase in their monthly bill.\n\nNewsweek reached out to CPUC via email for comment.\n\nPeople could see a reduction of $33 over the course of the summer just in the savings acquired from running their air conditioner under the new energy cost, the AP reported. Savings could be even higher -- up to $44 per month -- for people who own electric vehicles and charge them at home.\n\nHowever, for energy-conscious people -- or those who live in smaller buildings like apartments and use less energy -- the fixed monthly cost could be more than the reduced energy prices will save them.\n\nCritics of the proposal have argued that the fixed charge could deter Californians from being energy-conscious. California Representatives Mike Levin and Mike Thompson, both Democrats, wrote the CPUC in March expressing their concerns over the proposed charge.\n\n\"We are concerned that a high fixed charge could undercut investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency that Congress intended to encourage with the Inflation Reduction Act,\" the representatives wrote in the letter. \"We are further concerned that a high fixed charge could increase the electricity bills of millions of Californians, especially those who live in small homes, condos and apartments. Such setbacks could harm our progress on federal and state clean energy, climate, and equity goals.\"\n\nHowever, proponents of the proposal, such as utility companies, argue that the fixed charge would make acquiring clean energy more affordable.\n\nSouthern California Edison, the primary electric utility company for much of southern California, posted in favor of the new charge on X, formerly Twitter, in April. A spokesman for the company said that SCE won't make any additional money if the fixed charge is approved.\n\nThe post, which included a video, said, \"If the new fixed charge proposal is approved by the CPUC, it would help @SCE customers, establishing a reasonable flat fee for grid charges and lowering electricity costs for SCE residential customers, especially those with more modest means.\"\n\nThe spokesman in the video said the fixed charge would reduce customers' electric cost by 12.5 percent and make electricity more affordable for those who want to \"adopt clean technologies like electric vehicles\".", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_skinner@newsweek.com", "name": "Anna Skinner", "type": "author",

(AP) -- California regulators on Thursday voted to change how some power companies calculate their customers' bills, a decision that will make it less expensive for people to charge electric cars and cool their homes in the summer but will increase prices for those who don't use as much energy.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission voted to let the state's big investor-owned utilities -- including Pacific Gas & Electric -- add a fixed charge to people's power bills each month. For most people, the charge will be $24.15 per month and it will pay for installing and maintaining the equipment necessary to transmit electricity to homes. Residents with lower incomes who are enrolled in one of two discount programs will pay less, either $6 or $12 per month.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIn exchange for the new charge, the price of electricity will drop by between 5 cents and 7 cents per kilowatt hour. One kilowatt hour is how much power it takes to use a 1,000-watt appliance -- a coffee maker or vacuum cleaner, for instance -- for one hour.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe change will take effect late next year for customers of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. It will take effect in early 2026 for Pacific Gas & Electric customers.\n\nFor people who use a lot of energy each month, this will lower their monthly bills. People who live in Fresno -- where temperatures can often exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) -- would save about $33 running their air conditioners during the summer, according to the commission. That's because the savings they get from the price drop on electricity will be more than the amount they pay for the new fixed charge.\n\nIt will also benefit people who own electric cars and use other electric appliances, such as heat pumps. They will save an average of between $28 and $44 per month, according to the commission. In 2022, California accounted for 37% of the nation's light-duty electric vehicles, or about six times more than Florida, the state in second place, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n\"It provides affordability for lower-income Californians and those living in other parts of the state most impacted by extreme weather,\" California Public Utilities Commission President Alice Busching Reynolds said.\n\nFor people who don't use as much energy, the new fixed charge could increase their bill each month. This includes people who live in smaller apartments or who live in cooler areas and don't use air conditioning as much. That's because for them, the decrease in the price of electricity would not be enough to offset the amount of the new monthly charge.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOpponents argue it would act as a disincentive to conserve energy, something California has been urging people to do.\n\n\"If you wanted to design a policy instrument that would send the signal that conservation doesn't count, this would be it,\" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group.\n\nMost states already have fixed monthly charges on utility bills to pay for maintenance and infrastructure of the electric grid. But in California -- where electric rates are among the highest in the nation -- any move that could increase prices for anyone raises alarms among consumers and elected officials.\n\nA group of 18 members of Congress from California have called on the commission to keep the rate low, noting the national average for fixed charges on utility bills is $11. Some Democrats and Republicans in the state Legislature have backed a bill that would cap the charge at $10 per month.\n\n\"We must do more to rein in the ever-growing cost of living in our state, not find new ways to add to it,\" Republicans in the California Senate wrote in a letter urging the commission to reject the proposal.\n\nThe proposal is much lower than what the state's investor-owned utility companies had asked for, which was a charge between $53 and $71 per month. The commission also argues the charge would not discourage conservation, noting utilities are already allowed to increase rates during peak hours.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType":

This is for people of modest incomes with three or more people in the house. As an example, a three-person family would qualify if their annual household income ranges from $49,721 to $62,150.\n\n-- $24.15 a month for customers who are not on any sort of subsidized or discounted program.\n\nThe state PUC voted 4-0 to approve the new fixed charges.\n\n\"We recognize that electricity bills in California are high,\" PUC Commissioner Darcie Houck said before the vote. Commissioner Houck added, \"This is a relatively modest charge.\"\n\nIn early January, PG&E residential customers who receive combined electricity and gas services from the utility were jolted with a mammoth increase in monthly bills that hopped higher by more than 20% compared to early January 2023 -- far above the increase in the Bay Area inflation rate.\n\nThe fixed fees for monthly bills are slated to go into effect in late 2025 for customers of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, and in early 2026 for PG&E customers.\n\nNumerous people spoke before the PUC vote to denounce the new fee, which was made possible by a law that was approved quietly by the state Legislature a few years ago and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"For millions who live paycheck to paycheck, the impact of the utility tax would be devastating,\" Yvette DiCarlo, who represents a coalition of groups that opposes the new fixed fee, said in comments before the state PUC voted.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_avalos@mercurynews.com", "name": "George Avalos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Gas_&_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Gas & Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public utilities commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California_Edison", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California Edison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/SJM-L-CLIMATE-0809-3.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554703", "eventUri": "eng-9554703", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

That's after the California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously in favor of a controversial proposal that will lower the amount that consumers are charged per kilowatt hour, while adding the fixed charge.\n\nCPUC President Alice Reynolds said the new rate structure will incentivize people to use more clean energy and help pay for modernizing the grid.\n\n\"We're marching towards the future we want to see, we want this load growth,\" she said. \"One where we can replace gas guzzling cars on our roads with EVs that run on clean electricity and emit less pollutants.\"\n\nBut the plan has steeped in controversy. The CPUC said the change would lower electricity bills for many Californians, but critics argue it would do the opposite for middle-class families and others. Environmental groups are also torn over the proposed change. Some urge that it would help people convert to clean energy, while others say it won't make a difference.\n\nMost utilities in the U.S. already charge a fixed electricity rate. California's new proposal would vary by income. Low-income households would pay $6 or $12, while middle-class and high-income households would pay $24. In addition, the usage rate -- charged to consumers in cents per kilowatt hour -- would drop.\n\nCalifornia has the second-highest utilities rate after Hawaii. The national average fixed rate for electric bills is about $11 per month -- the new standard rate for California is more than double that. Currently, California operates under a pay-as-you-go model, with improvements to the power grid wrapped into the overall usage rate.", "source": {"uri": "kqed.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KQED"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Public_Utilities_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Public Utilities Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lower_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American lower class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Electrical", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Electrical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2024/05/GettyImages-1457745918-1020x680.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554703", "eventUri": "eng-9554703", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom.\n\nAccording to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the new billing structure will cut the price of electricity, bring down bills for lower-income people, and help the state's clean energy transition.\n\nBut Republican and Democratic officials have shown skepticism, including from some who originally voted for the plan, with Southern California representatives on either side of the aisle introducing their own bills to claw back the changes.\n\nAll residential customers of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and other investor-owned utilities will start seeing a flat rate on their bills, including those with rooftop solar.\n\nL.A. Department of Water and Power, Burbank Water and Power, Glendale Water and Power, and other municipal utility customers will not be impacted.\n\nMost people will pay a $24.15 flat rate per month, which is about $290 each year.\n\nBut low-income and affordable housing customers will pay a lot less -- $6 a month for those enrolled in the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program, which CPUC President Alice Reynolds said is one third of all utility customers. People in the Family Electricity Rate Assistance (FERA) program and those who live in affordable housing restricted to residents with incomes at or below a specific cutoff will pay $12 a month.\n\nAll customer bills will also include a reduced usage rate to cover the costs of each unit of electricity, but according to a CPUC fact sheet, the new structure doesn't introduce any new fees, \"it simply reallocates how existing costs are shared among customers.\"\n\nThe changes can start rolling out late next year for SoCal Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric customers. But PG&E, Bear Valley Electric Service, Inc., Liberty Utilities, and PacificCorp d/b/a Pacific Power will have to wait until early 2026.\n\nAlice Reynolds said during the meeting that the billing adjustment is very incremental, but an important step towards the state's decarbonized future, and is only one way officials are trying to keep pace with that transformation.\n\nShe said the affected customers will now be better off financially if they electrify, no matter where they live or the size of their home.\n\n\"The new billing structure will reduce the price per unit of electricity by roughly 5 to 7 cents per kilowatt hour,\" she said. \"This means that every time a customer plugs in their electric vehicle to a level two charger, and or dials up their electric heat pump, the price of that electricity they use will be cheaper.\"\n\nAlice Reynolds said the flat rate will cover some of the infrastructure costs of the wires and transformers needed to feed power to and from the people they serve.\n\nCommissioner John Reynolds said he wanted to respond directly to some of the discourse around the decision, saying the idea that this will \"undermine the motivation to conserve is quite frankly, laughable.\"\n\nHe also called the argument that the billing restructure is unfair to higher-income people irresponsible.\n\n\"This framing genuinely makes me sad, because there is little about our energy system that is tilted in favor of lower-income customers,\" he said. \"They pay exponentially more of their income for utilities. They're much more likely to live in older inefficient homes. They are much less likely to have access to things that can save them money like solar and batteries.\"\n\nJohn Reynolds said that argument ignores those realities.\n\nThe CPUC approved the plan in a 4 to 0 vote, with Commissioner Matthew Baker recusing himself for several items on the agenda.\n\nAssemblymember Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat who represents Thousand Oaks, Calabasas, and Malibu, has been fighting the fixed charge in recent months after she voted to support the move back in 2022.\n\nIrwin and a group of Democratic state lawmakers introduced Assembly Bill 1999 in January to repeal parts of the plan, but her bill has been sitting in the Rules Committee for about two weeks now.\n\n\"At a time when energy conservation is badly needed to avoid rolling blackouts, this dramatic policy shift could actually result in increased usage by some Californians,\" Irwin said in a Jan. 30 statement. \"The CPUC has had the authority to implement a fixed rate charge, up to $10, since 2015, but has declined to do so. I see no need to rush now.\"\n\nWhen asked about her change of heart at a Jan. 30 news conference from the state capitol, Irwin said the bill should've had more conversation, and the way it was quickly passed was \"not appropriate.\"\n\n\"This should have had a discussion in both houses, a thorough and robust discussion,\" she said. \"Policy decisions should not be made at the [C]PUC, they should be made by the legislative body.\"\n\nState Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a Republican who represents San Diego and Escondido, introduced similar legislation in February. After opposing the original bill, he added an urgency clause to Senate Bill 1326 that would've immediately repealed the restructuring, if passed and signed into law.\n\nJones told LAist his bill was designed to take authority back from the CPUC, which are governor-appointed positions, and return it to the legislature. He said he heard loud and clear from his constituents that the income-based rate structure was inappropriate.\n\n\"Not only am I concerned about saddling Californians with nearly $300 a year in additional charges, but I'm extremely troubled that the commission has unchecked power to raise this charge any time it wants,\" he said in a statement. \"The $24 per month this year could easily turn into a $50, $100, or an even higher charge next year.\"\n\nBut his plan stalled in the Senate Energy, Utilities, and Communications Committee late last month when all 14 Democrats didn't vote. The four Republicans on the committee voted in favor.\n\nNearly 2,500 people have signed Jones' petition supporting the bill, according to his office, and he said the more telling thing is that none of his Sacramento colleagues voted against it.\n\n\"None of the Democrats voted no,\" he said. \"So that indicates that they're nervous about this whole program, they know that the public is upset about it.\"\n\nIrwin didn't immediately respond to LAist's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

What's coming to your bill", "body": "As Californians gear up to turn on their air conditioning this summer, the state's utility regulator approved a hotly contested change to residential electricity rates. The agency authorized a flat fee of up to $24.15 and cuts to electricity costs by 5-7 cents per kilowatt-hour in a unanimous vote Thursday.\n\nRegulators argued this shift, which stands to impact 11 million customers of investor-owned utilities in the state, is a key step to slashing carbon emissions that cause climate change from homes. A fixed fee, they argued will help stabilize utility revenue and curb rising costs.\n\n\"The transition to all electric homes, cars and trucks is truly transformative. It means that we can ratchet down our use of petroleum and natural gas. It also means that our electricity rate design needs to evolve to meet this moment in time,\" said California Public Utilities Commission president Alice Busching Reynolds.\n\nReynolds added that the change does not add costs or fees, but rather changes the way existing costs are divvied up. The flat rate, she said \"will simply now cover some of the infrastructure costs to serve you.\"\n\nThe CPUC's proposal stirred major controversy in recent months, reviving a battle between allies of investor-owned utilities and proponents of rooftop solar. At the heart of the conflict is who will supply California homes with clean electricity and at what cost.\n\nCritics have been arguing that this measure will lead to higher bills for working and middle class customers while discouraging energy conservation, and it won't meaningfully encourage customers to adopt electric vehicles and heat pumps.\n\n\"The CPUC's proposal is exactly what Californians should be worried about, a big utility tax that is twice the national average and totally uncapped,\" said Bill Allayaud, director of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, in a statement.\n\nMany utilities across the U.S. include a fixed charge in customers' monthly electricity bills. But protesters outside vehemently opposed the CPUC's vote.\n\n\"Simply put, it is a blank check to profitable utilities that gives them a guaranteed revenue stream for the costly projects that drive expensive electricity rates,\" Allayaud said. \"Consumers by contrast will now have two ways for their bills to go up.\"\n\nCalifornians, including the 11 million who buy electricity from Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, already pay the second-highest rates in the nation after Hawaii. PG&E customers saw new rate hikes this year, with the average household paying an additional $34.50.\n\nYet other environmental groups, such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, support the electricity rate redesign as a first change of many needed to fix a growing crisis of rising electricity costs\n\n\"Electricity should be cheaper than fossil fuels and electric bills for our lowest income customers should continue to be affordable. This decision is a good first step in that direction,\" said Mohit Chhabra, senior analyst at NRDC, in a press briefing.\n\nCompanies and advocates connected to the rooftop solar industry say the change is certain to hurt the pocket book of rooftop solar customers. That industry is still smarting from new solar rules that slashed returns on what had long been a lucrative investment for California homeowners.\n\n\"This proposal will drastically change the value proposition for customers and for our business,\" said Erin Weber Kiel, government affairs manager for major rooftop solar company Sunnova. \"We have not seen a fixed charge get proposed anywhere near this high nationally.\"", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ari_plachta@fresnobee.com", "name": "Ari Plachta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Public_Utilities_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Public Utilities Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-owned_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Investor-owned utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooftop_solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rooftop solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy conservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Gas_&_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Gas & Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural Resources Defense Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California_Edison", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California Edison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.sacbee.com/news/7x3jhw/picture135866268/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/POWER%20WOES%20(1)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554703", "eventUri": "eng-9554703", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Californians already pay some of the highest electricity rates in the country. This vote will change how investor-owned utilities (IOUs) charge their customers. In KCRA 3's coverage area of Northern California, this would impact Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers. Experts say the revenue-neutral change for utilities could save some people -- namely those with low incomes and electric car owners -- money on their monthly bill while others will pay more. Here's what you need to know about the approved proposal, which lawmakers ordered as part of a 2022 law. Residential electricity bills would have 2 parts: a usage rate and a flat rate. California has been one of the only states where IOUs like PG&E do not have a flat rate for infrastructure and maintenance costs. In contrast, publicly-owned utilities like SMUD in Sacramento have flat rates.The new system is aimed at reducing the cost for people heavily impacted by extreme weather like a heat wave and also those who charge their electric cars at home.Usage Rate: The proposal should lower the usage rate by 5-7 cents per kilowatt hour. The rate will still vary throughout the day to encourage conservation, according to a fact sheet from the Public Utilities Commission. Rates for customers of the state's big three utilities could fall between 8% and 9.8% during peak hours, The Associated Press reported. Flat Rate: The proposed flat rate is $24.15 per month, the same amount as SMUD's flat rate. This flat rate would be discounted for people with lower incomes, $6 or $12 depending on the program. The CPUC says the $24.15 rate it recommends is on the lower end of a slate of proposals that topped out at $73. PG&E had recommended a $51 flat fee. How much money will people save? It depends on where you live, your income and how much electricity you use. PG&E customers are divided into \"climate zones,\" and most of those in KCRA 3's coverage area are in the climate zone \"S.\" Bills of PG&E customers with average usage would save about $1.47 a month. People enrolled in the low-income program, California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE), should save $5.74 a month with PG&E. About 30% of IOU customers make up this category, according to the state. It impacts households that earn below 200% of the federal poverty line. That changes to $12.63 savings for those PG&E customers who are enrolled in another income-qualified program, Family Electricity Rate Assistance (FERA). This impacts households that earn between 200% and 250% of the federal poverty line.Those who live in other climate zones aren't as fortunate. PG&E customers in climate zone \"Z\" in the northernmost part of the state who aren't enrolled in low-income programs will see an increase of $11.50 in their monthly bill. People in the Santa Cruz area, climate zone \"T,\" would have a $9.11 increase. People with electric cars and wealthier customers will likely benefit from the new systemThe state says that a customer who electrified their home and vehicle will save $28-44 a month on average, compared to the current rates. Customers who already don't use very much power don't get the benefit of a lower hourly rate. The Sierra Club said the $24 fixed rate \"is likely to raise monthly bills for low energy usage lower-middle class customers while lowering bills for wealthier consumers who tend to use more energy.\"When will the change take effect?

They said by lowering the rate per kilowatt hour it will encourage more people to buy electric cars and replace gas appliances in their homes, which would reduce the use of planet-warming fossil fuels.\n\nThe decision was criticized by some lawmakers from both parties, as well as a coalition of more than 250 consumer and other groups, who say millions of Californians living in small homes and apartments who are low users of electricity will now subsidize households who are heavy power users.\n\nWaving signs that said, \"Protect Working People\" and \"Protect Renters,\" dozens of coalition members opposed to the fee protested in front of the building where commissioners were meeting.\n\n\"This will punish people who use less energy,\" said Jenn Engstrom, the state director at CALPIRG. \"This will encourage high consumption and it will increase bills for millions of Californians.\"\n\nCommissioner John Reynolds dismissed the concerns before he voted for the proposal. \"The public discourse has been disappointing,\" he said.\n\nHe agreed that under the change some customers' total bills will go up, while others will see a decline. But the focus, he said, should be on the reduction in the rate per kilowatt hour, which is needed as the state tries to move more people away from fueling their cars and homes with fossil fuels to electricity, which is increasingly coming from wind and solar farms.\n\n\"We can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as a state,\" he said.\n\nThe commission was acting to approve the details and amount of the new fixed fee to comply with a 2022 law known as AB205.\n\nGov.

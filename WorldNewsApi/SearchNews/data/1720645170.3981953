Saab suggested Ojeda\u2019s death, believed to be a planned homicide, was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation. Ojeda, 32 at the time of his death, was a former Venezuelan lieutenant and a dissident of the Maduro regime once imprisoned on charges of rebellion and treason. Ojeda escaped prison and fled to Chile in 2017, eventually receiving asylum status from the Chilean government in December 2023. In February, three individuals impersonating Chilean police officers abducted Ojeda from his residence, dragging him out of his apartment barefoot and in his underwear. Ojeda\u2019s body was found ten days later buried inside a suitcase under a concrete structure in Chile\u2019s Santiago metropolitan region. Following an extensive investigation, the Chilean Prosecutor\u2019s Office announced in March that the Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan transnational criminal organization widely believed to have ties to the regime of dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, was involved in the killing of Ojeda. Shortly afterwards, Chilean authorities determined that the main suspect in the case was not just linked to Tren de Aragua, but had once worked for the Venezuelan government in 2015. A report published in April by Colombia\u2019s Caracol Televisi\u00f3n claimed that \u2013 based on testimonies and documentations obtained by the news channel, including documentation from U.S. authorities \u2013 the Maduro regime enlisted the aid of the Tren de Aragua to persecute Venezuelan dissidents currently located in other countries in the region. The Maduro regime\u2019s Attorney General Tarek William Saab claimed this week that the murder of Ojeda was part of a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation with the purported objective of \u201cmuddying the relations between Chile and Venezuela.\u201d Saab denied that there was a \u201cpolitical motive\u201d for killing the Venezuelan dissident and suggested that \u201cChilean and foreign intelligence bodies with spurious interests\u201d could have been involved in the crime. The Venezuelan attorney general\u2019s statements prompted the condemnation of Chilean Foreign Minister Alberto van Klaveran on Thursday, who described Saab\u2019s claims as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cincomprehensible.\u201d On that same day, Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced that he would instruct van Klaveran to issue a formal note of protest to the Maduro regime over Saab\u2019s statements. \u201cChile is a serious country, where institutions work, where there is separation of powers and where the Prosecutor\u2019s Office is carrying out a responsible investigation,\u201d Boric said, asserting that if Venezuelan police authorities have \u201cserious, real antecedents, they have to make them available to the Chilean Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\u201d \u201cThe Venezuelan prosecutor\u2019s comments show that there is no adequate will to be able to solve a case that is tremendously complex,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are going to insist in all instances without naivety for this to change and we are going to adopt all the measures within our reach.\u201d Chilean Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Gloria de la Fuente announced at a Friday morning press conference that the note of protest had been delivered to Venezuelan Ambassador in Chile Ar\u00e9valo M\u00e9ndez. In the note, de la Fuente said, the Chilean government expressed its \u201cdissatisfaction with the statements made by the Venezuelan Attorney General, Tarek William Saab.\u201d Boric ruled out on Thursday that Chile would rupture its relations with Venezuela over Ojeda\u2019s death, asserting to reporters that \u201cwhat has been proven to work is serious work, when there is bilateral cooperation.\u201d \u201cAnd I have no doubt that when institutions of our country are insulted, denigrated or questioned we have to respond very clearly and firmly as our foreign minister has done and as I am doing,\u201d Boric said. \u201cOf course, we demand respect from all countries with respect to Chilean institutions and in this respect no one in the government or the State can have any doubt that we have to be on the same line,\u201d he continued.

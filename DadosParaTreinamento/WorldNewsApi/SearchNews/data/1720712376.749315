In fact I was wondering if it was there was an opportunity to make out region famous for a particular fruit \u2013 the Champagne of the north? Fruits are also super versatile- you can eat then raw, bake them in pies and cakes, create fruit salads, cook and decorate with them, make drinks (not advocating home brews here though!) create jams and preserves and even use them for making perfume concoctions. So what am I growing and why? All experts agree fruit and vegetables are an excellent source of vitamins and minerals and as a vegan with a few bad habits, crisp sandwiches and frying pans among them, those are pretty important in my diet. You\u2019d probably need a big farm or at least a few fields to be completely self-sufficient but growing some things yourself is rewarding and it\u2019s nice to think you ar doing a little bit for the environment by cutting out food miles and also knowing there are no pesticides or preservatives in what you are growing. Strawberries The only fruit I\u2019ve started from seed this year have been tomatoes and Alpine strawberries, a small fruited hardy variety. They are growing\u2026 well, sort of. Just very, very slowly. So slowly in fact that I considered throwing them into the brown bin and reusing the tray for something else. But they\u2019ve come on a tiny bit in the last few weeks so I\u2019ll let them be. Last year I picked up two varieties of strawberry plants already in flower at a garden centre and this is a great option as the hard part is done for you and strawberries tend to fare very well in Ireland\u2019s rainy and relatively mild climate. The small plants took off in no time once transplanted to bigger pots and I ended up with maybe around 100 fresh strawberries last summer. After being left out all winter they have come back with a bang this year with and with some tomato feed watered into them they are now dotted with dainty white flowers - flowers which will soon drop their petals, change colour and turn into strawberries. You really can taste a difference too between fresh strawberries and shop bought varieties which may have travelled hundreds of miles over several days and may also have preservatives in them. Homegrown strawberries don\u2019t last long when plucked though so picking as you go is best. As an added bonus with strawberries is they don\u2019t need deep soil to grow as their roots tend to be shallow, making them more versatile. They grow very well in pots and in the ground, though in the latter their shoots can quickly spread and take over a large part of your garden \u2013 great if you want more strawberries, not so great if your other plants suffer as a result. Gooseberries The little-celebrated and under-rated gooseberry would be my top recommendation for anyone who wants to try their hand at growing fruit. It\u2019s a \u2018stick it in and leave\u2019 bush that needs next to nothing to thrive as the rain takes care of the watering. I\u2019ve had one growing in poor clay soil in one of the windiest parts of my garden for years and without fail it produces masses of fruit. Just be careful of the prickly thorns when picking. As an added bonus, they also grow easily from cuttings. You\u2019ll know when the fruit is ripe as all the little hairs fall away and it is soft on the stalk. Tomatoes It came as something as a surprise to learn you could grow tomatoes in Ireland no problem, even here in the very north of the island. I found that out about 20 years ago when a friend handed me a carrier bag full of them courtesy of his father\u2019s greenhouse. Inspired, I got some seeds and set about trying it myself back then with great success. I\u2019m sure the neighbours at the time in Derry city centre probably though there was something suspicious going on as I ended up with dozens of large tomato plants in big pots all over the concreted yard. From a distance they looked a bit like another type of plant altogether\u2026. But I didn\u2019t get a single tomato because what I didn\u2019t know then was you have to sow them early \u2013 in February- as they need a good few months of warmish weather to grow and for the fruit to mature. They are best grown in a greenhouse, by a window or behind glass doors if you can but there are some varieties that will thrive out in the open too. Just do a bit of research first. I\u2019ve gone with Moneymaker and cherry varieties and they are already flowering now in late May three months after they were sown so i should get at least some fruit this summer. Blueberries These are an unknown for me. I bought a few slips in a discount store and they are growing very slowly. The one thing about blueberries I didn\u2019t know until I looked them up is they need a different type of compost \u2013 ericaceous - as they are acidic soil loving plants and they need special plant food too so they are a bit more of a hassle than the others but hopefully worth the effort in the years to come. Fortunately almost all if not all garden stores sell ericaceous compost and food for these fuss pots. Blackcurrant and redcurrant I\u2019ve had a redcurrant bush for years next to the gooseberry bush in the same poor soil, and like the latter it is a great producer of little bunches of red berries every year with no special treatment needed. I\u2019m growing a blackcurrant bush in a pot for the first time at the minute too and it is thriving, so both seen to be low maintenance options. Pear tree I have a pear tree in my garden for years next to the redcurrant but it has never fared well in the clay, shallow soil and although I have had a few pears from it, it probably needs a richer, deeper spot with less wind so I may dig it out this year. But it shows pears are an option as are apple trees of course (just don\u2019t eat the seeds!) Blackberries Growing wild behind my fence and constantly poking through are blackberries brambles. These are widespread across Ireland and as kids we used to roam the back roads of Galliagh with my parents and my da\u2019s greyhounds collecting them from the hedgerows in little tins. Blackberries are abundant everywhere in Ireland, taste great and best of all they\u2019re free! I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot more fruit growers with other ideas in what works well out there.

Since most vacations come with time limits, even the most devoted Franco-Italophiles know it isn\u2019t always easy or practical to try to fit in both destinations in one frenzied holiday swoop. But there is an easy solution if you don\u2019t want to have to choose\u2014stay on the westernmost part of the Italian Riviera (Imperia) or in the easternmost part of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur (Menton), so you can easily hop between Italy and France and experience some of the best locations each has to offer. If your hotel is in Sanremo, Italy, for example, Nice is only about an hour\u2019s drive away. From Menton, you can travel the length of Imperia\u2019s Riviera di Fiori, also in about an hour by car. Here\u2019s what to do and see in these neighboring and sublime coastal regions.

Densely packed with compact stone houses and a warren of steep streets, these hamlets typically tucked churches, a castle stronghold and surveillance towers within their fortified walls. In later centuries, newer districts grew up around the ancient cores, so when you visit today, you get an old-town/new-town experience. The shopping district and Via Giacomo Matteotti in Sanremo. getty Sanremo\u2019s old town is called \u201cLa Pigna\u201d (pinecone), as the streets were mapped in a way that resembles the pattern of pinecone scales. Dating from 1000 A.D., La Pigna is easily accessible from Sanremo\u2019s major shopping street, Via Giacomo Matteotti. The Regina Elena Gardens, named after a queen of Italy, make a nice resting spot after the trek to the top of this historic settlement, where the views of the port and town are outstanding. In Bordighera, head to the Citt\u00e0 Alta, a compact former borgo crisscrossed with centuries-old caruggi, where you\u2019ll find small shops and restaurants offering sea-centric Bordighera cuisine. Imperia was a comune created in 1923, uniting the towns of Oneglia and Porto Maurizio, along with a cluster of nearby hamlets. Parasio, the centro storico of Porto Maurizio, sits on a promontory and offers diverse architectural styles\u2014medieval, baroque and neoclassical. The old town in France\u2019s Menton, designated a \u201cVille d\u2019art et Histoire\u201d in 1991, rises above the Vieux-Port and is a delight to explore, especially the Rue Longue, an ancient street from the 13th century.The piazza outside the landmark Basilica Saint-Michael has commanding views of the area. It is also where the annual Menton Music Festival is held. A sidewalk cafe in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. getty In the Roquebrune part of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, you\u2019ll find the vieille ville with a 10th-century castle and various spots providing expansive panoramas. Coco Chanel, who helped popularize the French Riviera as a summer destination, had a villa here; it was also a favorite vacation stop of Winston Churchill. Take in the art and architecture Mus\u00e9e Matisse in Nice. getty Painters, writers and musicians have long been attracted to the extraordinary natural beauty of the French and Italian Rivieras, settling in for both short and long stays (Matisse spent nearly three decades in Nice). Museums along the coast commemorate the works of the most famous maestros who came here, like the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Antibes (the artist painted in a studio in the town\u2019s former Grimaldi Castle), the Mus\u00e9e Matisse and the Mus\u00e9e National Marc Chagall, both in Nice. In Menton there\u2019s a museum devoted to the work of Jean Cocteau, the polymath author, film director and artist. Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. getty Sanremo's casino. getty The area offers many architectural treasures as well. Blossoming as winter resorts in the 19th century, French and Italian coastal towns enjoyed a building boom, when villas and grand hotels were built in various Belle Epoque styles. You can see these lavish structures in Sanremo (the casino and villas located along the Corso degli Inglesi); Bordighera (the Villa Etelinda and Villa Regina Margherita, owned by a queen of Italy); and many splendid period properties in Menton, where hotels from the fin-de-si\u00e8cle era, like the Grand H\u00f4tel des Ambassadeurs and Le Royal Westminster, are still in operation. Of course, there\u2019s more Belle Epoque splendor in nearby Monte Carlo at the luxe Hotel Hermitage and Hotel de Paris, and the elaborate casino designed by Charles Garnier. Also not to miss: the Villa et Jardins Ephrussi de Rothschild, a grand palace and monument historique surrounded by lavish, themed gardens, built for B\u00e9atrice de Rothschild in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. See the scenic hill towns Cervo in Liguria. getty Italy and France are famous for their lovely hill towns, but if you\u2019re seeking lesser-known locales with not only sweeping views of rural splendor, but the seaside as well, there are a number of medieval villages along the Riviera di Fiori and in the pays Mentonnais (the Menton countryside) to seek out. Italy\u2019s Cervo is only 66 meters high, but that\u2019s more than enough height to take in the coastal scenics. In this town, tiers of pastel buildings reach all the way to the sea, where you\u2019ll happen upon a swath of sandy beach. The town is also noted for its castle, exquisite Baroque church and sea promenade. Seborga, about a half-hour drive from Bordighera, commands views of the French and Italian Rivieras, all the way to Monaco. This village comes with an unusual history, having proclaimed itself an independent principality in recent decades (although not recognized by Italy), with an elected prince or princess, and locally minted currency and stamps. Perinaldo, also 30 minutes from Bordighera, is known for its artichokes, olive oil, and prominent astronomers (native son, Giovanni Cassini, discovered four of Saturn\u2019s satellite moons). There\u2019s a noted astronomical observatory named after Cassini in the town hall. (Cervo, Seborga and Perinaldo are listed among I Borghi pi\u00f9 belli d\u2019Italia.) Sainte-Agn\u00e8s, near Menton, is ranked as the highest coastal village in Europe. getty Across the border in the Alpes-Maritimes, there are several hamlets on high, les villages perch\u00e9s of the pays Mentonnais. Castellar lies closest to Italy, with stunning views of Menton\u2019s Bay of Garavan and an historic center with building facades painted in citrus colors. In spring the area blossoms with a profusion of peonies. To the west of Castellar, Sainte-Agn\u00e8s, at 800 meters, is ranked as the highest village in coastal Europe and as one of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France. Gorbio, home to a chateau still inhabited by the family that has owned it since the 17th century, lies to the south. (Note: All three towns are about a 20-to-25-minute drive from Mention. Access to many hilltop villages in mountainous regions in Italy and France often involves driving steep, narrow and winding roads. Travel cautiously and only in good weather with experienced drivers.) A beach in Sanremo. getty The seafront in Menton. getty Relax at the beaches On both sides of the border you\u2019ll find a variety of places to soak up the sun or take a swim. In Italy, those who like sandy beaches can head to the small towns of Arma di Taggia and San Lorenzo al Mare or the major resort, Sanremo, which has sections of sandy coast. Bordighera offers a beautiful expanse of pebbly beach with many lidos and seaside restaurants. La Spiagetta dei Balzi Rossi is a famous beach near the Balzi Rossi archaeological site with pebbly terrain and translucent waters. Menton has sandy beaches flanking the lungomare leading to the Old Port, and a more pebbly mix along the coast adjacent to the Promenade du Soleil; both areas are lined with restaurants, clubs and private and public beaches (which fill up early on weekends in peak season). In Roquebrune-Cap-Martin you\u2019ll come across beautiful pebbly beaches like the Plage de Carnol\u00e8s, Plage du Buse, and Plage du Golfe Bleu. Savor the coastal cooking An Italian fish stew. getty Sardenaira. Getty Although part of the same kingdom for centuries (the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur was annexed to France in 1860), the French and Italian Rivieras developed local cuisines. But even today there are many similarities, for example, Liguria\u2019s ubiquitous pesto has a culinary cousin in France called pistou (although made without cheese or pine nuts; sometimes almonds are added). The French fish stews bouillabaise and bourride have an Italian counterpart in burrida. The Rivieras produce their own forms of pizza-like dishes\u2014try sardenaira, made with tomatoes, anchovies and olives when you\u2019re visiting towns in Imperia, like Sanremo. Order pissaladi\u00e8re, with caramelized onions, olives and anchovies along the Cote d\u2019Azur. Wherever you land it won\u2019t be hard to eat well.

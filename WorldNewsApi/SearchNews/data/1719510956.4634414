{"id": 223729918, "title": "Billions flow through California special districts. Who makes big money in your city or county?", "text": "THE CAMERA SWEEPS over a spreadsheet tallying billions of dollars. The image DISSOLVES to piles of $100 bills, pulls in tight on Benjamin Franklin\u2019s slightly sour expression, then fades to black. \u201cHave you ever seen a patchwork quilt?\u201d coos the narrator\u2019s soothing voice as a MAP OF CALIFORNIA comes into view. \u201cThat\u2019s when one piece of fabric overlaps the next, which overlaps the next, which overlaps the next. Critics of California\u2019s special districts have likened them to a patchwork quilt because they exist inside city and county governments that could do their jobs \u2014 delivering water, treating sewage, killing mosquitoes, operating cemeteries and the like \u2014 thus eliminating an often-invisible and arguably redundant layer of local government.\u201d OK, OK, we are not in high school and we certainly would not have won the \u201cDistricts Make the Difference\u201d student video contest sponsored by the National Special Districts Association and helmed by the California Special Districts Association. Two of the three winners are from California, though (a Cupertino kid won $2,000, a San Marcos kid won $1,000 and a Montana kid won $500). One of the Top 10 finalists is from Irvine. Congratulations! Their videos celebrate the pixie dust sprinkled by special districts over our governmental garden. There was a cute dog riding a bus extolling the transportation district\u2019s charms, some jazzy special effects touting the respite offered by the park district, and the cartoon sweetness of a little girl proclaiming \u201cSpecial districts are really special!\u201d How special, though, really? California has one state government, 58 counties, 482 cities, 939 school districts and more than 2,000 independent special districts. If any of the student filmmakers was wondering, \u201cHmmm, don\u2019t we also have a city that runs parks?\u201d or \u201cDoesn\u2019t the county operate an extensive library system? Why do we need a separate library district, too?\u201d or \u201cWe actually have separate governments to run cemeteries and other governments to deal with rats and mosquitoes?!\u201d, well, those questions didn\u2019t make it into the final cuts. The one-minute films actually sounded an awful lot like commercials. So we started daydreaming about what our one-minute special district video would be like. Our movie CUT TO JOHN OLIVER\u2019S classic \u201cSpecial Districts\u201d segment of \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d \u201cOur main story tonight concerns government: Sports for nerds,\u201d Oliver says. CUT TO EXPERT, who says special districts are the most common form of local government and take in about $100 billion a year nationally (a very old number \u2014 California\u2019s special districts rake in nearly that much all by themselves). CUT BACK TO AN ASTONISHED OLIVER. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy!\u201d Oliver says. \u201cIt\u2019s like finding out the highest-paid athlete in the world is Harold. I mean, who the (expletive) is Harold? What sport does he play? Why don\u2019t people talk about this all the time?! How am I only hearing about Harold now? You\u2019re making me feel a fool!\u201d CUT TO A RIDER ON HORSEBACK, silhouetted black against a blazing orange sun. \u201cSpecial districts were born in California\u2019s Wild Wild West, back before there were city or county governments to provide essential services,\u201d our narrator intones as SKYSCRAPERS and SUBDIVISIONS pop up on the California map. \u201cBut once cities and counties sprouted all around them, special districts did not go away. \u201cWhile critics have called them \u2018ghost governments\u2019 and myriad grand juries have called for their consolidation or elimination, special districts persist, saying they\u2019re zealous guardians of water, sewer, transportation systems and the like. The billions of dollars they\u2019ve amassed to build, repair and replace vital infrastructure could easily be squandered in the hands of reckless counties and city councils, who might cave to competing interests and lavish those dollars on less-worthy pursuits. The focus of a special district is singular and pure, they say.\u201d WATER BILLS and SEWER BILLS flutter by the camera lens. \u201cThe vagaries of Proposition 13 mean a lot of them have gob-loads of money because they get property tax dollars as well as fees for service!\u201d our honey-voiced narrator would enthuse. \u201cIn 2013, California\u2019s special districts collected $41 billion in fees for service and property taxes, and spent $40.8 billion, according to data from the state controller. \u201cTen years later, special districts collected $90.5 billion and spent $83.9 billion. That\u2019s an increase of more than 100%, while inflation increased just 27% over that period.\u201d Our film would also tell you that the gob-loads of money special districts amass has raised so many eyebrows, for so long, that the Legislature requires the 250 biggest to report their finances separately. This reporting was prompted by a good-government watchdog group called the Little Hoover Commission, which sputtered over special district reserve funds that dwarfed their annual spending. That blistering study, \u201cSpecial Districts: Relics of the Past or Resources for the Future?\u201d bemoaned hospital districts that no longer run hospitals but continue to exist and collect taxes anyway, and chided Local Agency Formation Commissions \u2014 one in every county, charged with ensuring government efficiency \u2014 for being unable or unwilling to make sensible mergers happen. We\u2019d tell you that the state\u2019s largest 250 special districts had cash and investments of $25.8 billion in 2013 \u2014 and of $63.8 billion in 2022. \u201cWhoa!\u201d our honey-voiced narrator says. Pay and perks CUT TO WATER DISTRICT WORKERS digging trenches for new water lines, interspersed with SEWER DISTRICT WORKERS shoveling \u201ccake\u201d \u2014 the solid gunk left over after wastewater is treated. \u201cAnd special districts employ a lot of people, too!\u201d our narrator continues. \u201cWhile there were 149,567 employee positions in 2013, with total compensation of $9.7 billion, the employee count grew to 176,702 positions with total comp of $15 billion a decade later.\u201d We\u2019d tell you that 11 of those special district employees made total compensation (pay and perks) of more than $1 million a year, and all of them were in health care-related positions. Statewide, they were led by the CEO of the Palomar Health District in San Diego County, with total comp of $1.8 million; doctors with the Kern County Hospital Authority, earning $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $1.7 million in total comp; the CEO of the Salinas Valley Memorial Healthcare District, with total comp of $1.4 million; and the CEO of the Beta Healthcare Group Risk Management Authority, with total comp of $1.2 million. CUT TO FIREFIGHTERS washing a truck. In Orange County, the Orange County Fire Authority dominates the top of the list, as public safety perks are expensive and firefighters rack up a lot of overtime. The five highest special district earners were the CEO of the Orange County Transportation Authority, with total comp of $608,439; the Orange County Fire Authority\u2019s chief, with total comp of $529,939; an OCFA fire captain, with total comp of $526,172; another OCFA fire captain, with total comp of $522,172; and an Orange County Transportation Authority deputy CEO, with total comp of $512,164. In Los Angeles County, the top five were a more varied bunch. No. 1 was the CEO of the Antelope Valley Healthcare District, with total comp of $806,326; CEO of the Alliance of Schools For Cooperative Insurance Programs, with total comp of $648,441; the assistant chief engineer/assistant general manager of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District No. 2, with total comp of $613,813; Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s CEO, with total comp of $548,992; and the Foothill Transit Administration\u2019s CEO, with total comp of $534,554. CUT TO TREE-LINED PALM CANYON DRIVE. In Riverside County, the highest-comped worker was the CEO of Visit Greater Palm Springs, at $762,224; the chief of the Idyllwild Fire Protection District, at $498,023; the general manager of the Eastern Municipal Water District, at $495,501; the Coachella Valley Water District\u2019s general manager, at $494,934; and the Coachella Valley Water District\u2019s assistant general manager, at $461,656. In San Bernardino County, all the highest-compensated special district jobs were with the Inland Empire Health Plan, where the top five officers had total comp of $917,222; $741,007; $700,341; $687,843; and $638,620. Crazy quilt CUT BACK TO JOHN OLIVER. \u201cIt\u2019s a little weird, in a country that talks so much about government accountability, that a huge amount of our tax dollars go to fund entities that most of us know absolutely nothing about,\u201d Oliver says. He does credit California for making special district operations more transparent. Our honey-voiced narrator suggests that\u2019s not making much difference. CUT TO SWIRLING NEWSPAPER, THEN TIGHT ON HEADLINE: \u201cCrazy quilt of overlapping governments is no laughing matter. Column: Too many water districts? There\u2019s an agency for that. It faces huge headwinds trying to make local government logical.\u201d The narrator quotes a droll Bob Braitman, retired Local Agency Formation Commission executive in many California counties: \u201cBelieve it or not, special districts sometimes don\u2019t want to consolidate. If you look it up in your dictionary, it\u2019s something called \u2018parochialism.\u2019 Sometimes they pay their board of directors\u2019 members a stipend. Sometimes the directors don\u2019t want to give up that stipend, or the status that goes with it. Sometimes they\u2019re opposed even if it would be logical. Sometimes.\u201d CUT TO OLIVER. \u201cThey\u2019re like Styrofoam packing peanuts \u2026 they\u2019ll be with us \u2019til the end of time,\u201d he says. Our honey-voiced narrator wraps up by congratulating the high school students on their videos \u2014 each won $500 for teachers at their schools, for a total of $5,000 in special district prize money \u2014 and expresses hope that the students remain involved in their communities, civically engaged with their local governments, and develop a healthy skepticism of PR spin.", "summary": "Columnist Teri Sforza writes about the huge amounts that go to what some call ghost governments.

{"id": 223813320, "title": "Leo Cullen needs to shift focus to attack if Leinster are to end final pain", "text": "In 2022 it was the Boulevard Michelet in Marseille. Last year it was Lansdowne Road in Dublin. On Saturday evening it was the slightly grittier backdrop of Tottenham High Road, but the post-match pain on the faces of Leinster supporters was wearily familiar. Three points, one point, an extra-time defeat: the margins are desperately slim but the sense of deja vu is growing stronger. Mix in Ireland\u2019s World Cup quarter-final defeat by the All Blacks and the so\u2011near\u2011yet\u2011so\u2011far pattern is impossible to ignore. Irish rugby still boasts plentiful talent but the uncomfortable losses are stacking up. As Leo Cullen, Leinster\u2019s director of rugby, acknowledged, not all the postmortems will be sympathetic. \u201cThe lads are going to need to show a bit of character now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a sense of what\u2019s coming ... you lose another final and we\u2019ve got to be able to deal with that.\u201d To some extent it is an occupational hazard of top-class sport. Toulouse are a great side and no club have the divine right to sew gold stars on their jerseys. Leinster remain superior to many other wannabes. But what are their downcast followers meant to do? Shrug their shoulders and await another runners-up medal next year? Or wonder aloud if there might be any underlying reasons why this particular bunch of players continue to fall agonisingly short? The quality of France\u2019s leading sides is clearly a factor. As with La Rochelle, there is no shame to losing against such classy opposition. The extraordinary Antoine Dupont is an all-time great and the burgeoning Top 14 has claimed four successive Champions Cup victories, with power to add. Toulouse have now won this tournament on a record six occasions and the scenes in the city\u2019s Place du Capitole were suitably euphoric. But even Leinster\u2019s most loyal fans cannot ignore the obvious. Their team had their chances and didn\u2019t take them. They turned down a string of kickable penalties, were never ahead and were unable to land the late drop goal that would have avoided extra time. Not all of it was down to the fates or an unsympathetic referee. What has happened, for example, to the attacking shape that once carved defences open under Stuart Lancaster\u2019s tutelage? The modern game is about turning half\u2011chances into points, thinking smart and not necessarily doing the obvious, and the retired Johnny Sexton\u2019s all-seeing brain remains conspicuously absent. Instead Leinster now send Jacques Nienaber on to the field as a water boy to try to micro\u2011manage games. They pick a perfectly decent but limited fly-half to stick to a playbook that grows steadily less ambitious. Rather than grabbing the ball and kicking three points when they cried out to be taken on Saturday, they stuck to a prepared script which, ultimately, failed to exert sufficient scoreboard pressure. In frenetic, tight games an obsession with control and playing the percentages is not always bearing fruit and other teams are also outlasting them physically. As was the case last season, where they let a 17-0 lead slip against a La Rochelle side who found another gear despite being reduced to 14 men late on, they were also unable to locate a sprint finish when they really needed one. Toulouse, with Dupont and Jack Willis to the fore, had no such problems in a marathon encounter that, from kick\u2011off to the final whistle, ended up spanning two hours, 45 minutes. Dupont did make a couple of small errors but cranked up his performance to a whole different level when it mattered. Leinster had some outstanding contributors \u2013 how good was Caelan Doris? \u2013 but need a few more players with the ability and aura to shape big games in the way Sexton and Brian O\u2019Driscoll once did. That steely self-belief is less apparent these days, which may be another reason why the Springbok lock RG Snyman and New Zealand\u2019s versatile Jordie Barrett will be wearing Leinster blue next season. Harsh, perhaps, but it feels like the time to try a different starting 10 and to obsess slightly less about defence at the expense of greater attacking variation. But Leinster are a sizeable tanker and, as Nienaber and Cullen have been finding, these things do not happen overnight. That nervy Croke Park semi-final \u2013 when Northampton almost caught them napping after a poor start \u2013 also now feels less like a blip than it did previously. Maybe the World Cup disappointment is still sapping a few minds and bodies, with Ireland\u2019s defeat against England at Twickenham another potential case study. True, Andy Farrell\u2019s Leinster\u2011dominated squad still collected another Six Nations title but the tour to South Africa this summer suddenly feels a tougher gig than it did a few months ago. Either way, from Leinster\u2019s perspective, only a glorious victory in next year\u2019s final \u2013 to be staged in Cardiff on 24 May \u2013 can now ease the collective pain. Professional sport can be wonderfully fulfilling but, equally, it is a brutal playground. While Leinster still have huge support, significant financial muscle and a steady supply of schoolboy talent, the external pressure is rising. \u201cThere is still a belief that we can do this,\u201d Cullen insisted. In their heart of hearts, though, Leinster\u2019s high command will know that something has to change.", "summary": "<p>Champions Cup defeat against Toulouse was another Leinster near miss and the time is right to obsess slightly less on defence</p><p>In 2022 it was the Boulevard Michelet in Marseille.

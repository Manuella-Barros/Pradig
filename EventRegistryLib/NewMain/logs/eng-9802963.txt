I mean, they just told me when I was doing TV that it was, like, before I was born that it kind of started, which is wild,\" Stewart said. \"It just goes to show those that have really paved the way and to create USA Basketball and what it is now. Tons of appreciation for that and knowing that when you represent this jersey and wear USA across your chest the standard is high and there really is nothing higher.\"\n\nAnd the team didn't disappoint some notable onlookers, including Sue Bird, Dawn Staley, Kevin Durant and Vanessa Bryant and her children.\n\nAfter the business-like semifinal win in which the U.S. started strong and never took its foot off the gas, the Americans will face either France or Belgium for the title. The U.S. is trying to become the first team -- in any sport -- to win eight consecutive Olympic gold medals, breaking the tie with the U.S. men's program that won seven in a row from 1936-68.\n\nThe U.S. was able to take control of the game in the first half allowing coach Cheryl Reeve the opportunity to play her starters limited minutes, give players on the bench more court time, so everyone will be fresh and mentally set for the gold medal game.\n\n\"The group that's going to be out there is going to be a little more ready and rested to be able to give everything they had,\" Reeve said.\n\nA win Sunday would be a record sixth gold medal for Diana Taurasi. A game after not starting for the first time since the 2004 Olympics, the Americans' most decorated Olympic basketball player didn't enter the game until 2:08 remained in the third quarter with the U.S. up 63-40. She missed her two shots, playing just a little over 6 minutes.\n\nThe U.S. jumped out to an early lead on Australia, but only were up 20-16 after the opening quarter. The Americans put the game away in the second quarter, starting the period with a 12-0 run. The U.S. led 45-27 at the half.\n\nJackie Young added 14 points, Kahleah Copper 11 and A'ja WIlson 10 for the Americans.\n\nIsobel Borlase led Australia with 11, and Tess Madgen and Ezi Magbegor each had 10.\n\nThere was no shortage of WNBA players on the court.\n\nBut while the American team features 12 WNBA All-Stars who have won multiple MVPs, the Australia roster is full of complimentary players in the league. The Opals, who started five current WNBA players, just didn't have enough offensive firepower to compete with the U.S. juggernaut.\n\nIn the end, the U.S. once again denied the Australians a chance at a gold medal in what's been a one-sided affair between the teams. The Opals have never beaten the U.S. in Olympic competition, losing in the gold medal game in 2000, '04 and '08.\n\n\"We had to play a perfect game today. I always say you got to believe that you can\" beat the U.S., Australia coach Sandy Brondello said. \"But nine times out of 10, there's one game where you maybe can get them on a bad day. And it wasn't our best day here.\"\n\nThe Australians also lost to the U.S. in the semifinals of the 1996 and 2012 Olympics.\n\n\"America, they're the goats for a reason, you know?\" said Australian Lauren Jackson, who has played in five of those losses. \"They are full of superstars and I mean you look at the name on every single jersey out there and they are the best players in the world for a reason. They're incredible.\"\n\nJackson played 5 minutes after sitting out the last two games and didn't score. The 43-year-old Jackson hasn't contributed much in this Olympics, but the fact she's still playing is a near miracle itself after she retired due to injuries in 2016.\n\nJackson made a return for the Opals at the 2022 World Cup, helping the team earn bronze there. Now she'll hope that the team can get one more win Sunday to medal -- something the Australians have done in each of the four other Olympics she's competed in.\n\nThe U.S. will be looking for another gold.\n\n\"I'm so proud of us,\" Reeve said. \"You know, the evolution that we've made as a team. And I'm excited that we've got ... to the last stand, if you will, in this campaign.

At the Atlanta 1996 Olympics, the United States defeated Australia in the semi-finals (the Opals subsequently won their first-ever Olympic bronze). In the gold medal match at Sydney 2000, one of the last events of the home Games for Australia, it was the USA who spoiled the party, with an emphatic 22-point win.\n\nFour years later, in Athens, the gold medal rematch saw the same result - although the Opals reduced the losing margin to 11 points. Another Olympics, another loss to the USA. At the Beijing Games in 2008, the Australians were forced to settle for their third consecutive silver medal, behind the Americans. In London, the teams met in the semi-final: another American victory, the Opals going on to claim bronze. An early exit in Rio spared the Australians yet another encounter with the USA. Normalcy was restored in Tokyo: the nations faced each other in the quarter-finals, and the Americans won resoundingly.\n\nSo when Opals veteran Lauren Jackson was asked about an impending semi-final encounter with the Americans, she offered a wry smile. \"We've had great tussles with them over the years,\" said the basketball legend, in Paris for her fifth Olympics. \"Obviously we would have loved to play them in the gold medal match.\"\n\nInstead, on Friday, the nations will meet once more at Bercy Arena in the semi-final. The fact the basketball heavyweights are meeting in the penultimate round, and not the gold medal match, is down to Australia: they were defeated by Nigeria in the opening game, meaning the Opals progressed from the pool as the second ranked team. But the team's rapid improvement since, culminating with a dominant victory over Serbia on Wednesday, has left Australian fans dreaming. Is this the Olympics where the Opals finally slay the American dragon and win gold?\n\nThe Australians are not getting ahead of themselves - they have been left heartbroken too many times before. But Jackson, who has played only limited minutes in Paris since returning for her first Games since London 2012, was upbeat. \"We'll see how it goes,\" she said, hedging. \"This team has an innate belief in themselves and what they're able to achieve.\"\n\nAlanna Smith, one of seven current Opals to play their club basketball in the American WNBA, was more direct. \"It's just a big rivalry, even in the lead-up to the Olympics, I was playing in the US and they were talking shit. \"They've had a history of winning, but now's the time we can topple that. It would be sweet to take them down a peg, for sure, but we have to prepare for a fight.\"\n\nSmith, 27, is one member of a newer generation of Opals, without the same weight of history when it comes to facing the Americans. 21-year-old Washington Mystics guard Jade Melbourne was immense in the quarter-final against Serbia, while Ezi Magbegor, 24, is a mainstay of the Opals team. With a new young core, and plenty of experienced older players, Australia seem to be hitting form at just the right time.\n\nThe USA, too, have been playing superb basketball so far in Paris. They won all three of their pool matches, against Japan, Belgium and Germany, with an overall points difference of plus-58. They had to fight harder in the quarter-final against Nigeria, who had downed Australia earlier in the tournament. But despite Nigeria's best attempts, the Americans ran out 14 point winners. It is not for nothing that the USA are currently on a seven-Olympics gold medal streak.\n\nBut Jackson, speaking after Australia's win over Serbia, was undaunted. The team's elder stateswoman, making a remarkable return to international basketball after retiring years ago, pointed to the new generation - players who emerged since she initially left the sport before the Rio Olympics.\n\n\"You're seeing the Opals getting better every half of basketball,\" said the 43-year-old. \"The girls are really resilient. It's a new generation of athletes going through the WNBA, playing big roles in the WNBA, they know how to play against the American team. In my opinion, we're there with a shot. Absolutely.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Australians face yet another Olympic encounter with Team USA. For Jackson, and a younger generation of Opals, it is time to defy history.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Michael Conroy/Associated Press\n\nPARIS -- Breanna Stewart and the U.S. women's basketball team cruised to a familiar place - the Olympic gold medal game.\n\nStewart led a balanced offense as the Americans beat Australia 85-64 on Friday in the semifinals to extend their Olympic winning streak to 60 consecutive games dating back to the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\n\"The streak is crazy. I mean, they just told me when I was doing TV that it was, like, before I was born that it kind of started, which is wild,\" Stewart said. \"It just goes to show those that have really paved the way and to create USA Basketball and what it is now. Tons of appreciation for that and knowing that when you represent this jersey and wear USA across your chest the standard is high and there really is nothing higher.\"\n\nAnd the team didn't disappoint some notable onlookers, including Sue Bird, Dawn Staley, Kevin Durant and Vanessa Bryant and her children.\n\nAfter the business-like semifinal win in which the U.S. started strong and never took its foot off the gas, the Americans will face either France or Belgium for the title. The U.S. is trying to become the first team - in any sport - to win eight consecutive Olympic gold medals, breaking the tie with the U.S. men's program that won seven in a row from 1936-68.\n\nThe U.S. was able to take control of the game in the first half allowing Coach Cheryl Reeve the opportunity to play her starters limited minutes, give players on the bench more court time, so everyone will be fresh and mentally set for the gold medal game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The group that's going to be out there is going to be a little more ready and rested to be able to give everything they had,\" Reeve said.\n\nA win Sunday would be a record sixth gold medal for Diana Taurasi. A game after not starting for the first time since the 2004 Olympics, the Americans' most decorated Olympic basketball player didn't enter the game until 2:08 remained in the third quarter with the U.S. up 63-40. She missed her two shots, playing just a little over 6 minutes.\n\nThe U.S. jumped out to an early lead on Australia, but only were up 20-16 after the opening quarter. The Americans put the game away in the second quarter, starting the period with a 12-0 run. The U.S. led 45-27 at the half.\n\nJackie Young added 14 points, Kahleah Copper 11 and A'ja Wilson 10 for the Americans.\n\nIsobel Borlase led Australia with 11, and Tess Madgen and Ezi Magbegor each had 10.\n\nThere was no shortage of WNBA players on the court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the American team features 12 WNBA All-Stars who have won multiple MVPs, the Australia roster is full of complimentary players in the league. The Opals, who started five current WNBA players, just didn't have enough offensive firepower to compete with the U.S. juggernaut.\n\nIn the end, the U.S. once again denied the Australians a chance at a gold medal in what's been a one-sided affair between the teams. The Opals have never beaten the U.S. in Olympic competition, losing in the gold medal game in 2000, '04 and '08.\n\n\"We had to play a perfect game today. I always say you got to believe that you can\" beat the U.S., Australia Coach Sandy Brondello said. \"But nine times out of 10, there's one game where you maybe can get them on a bad day. And it wasn't our best day here.\"\n\nThe Australians also lost to the U.S. in the semifinals of the 1996 and 2012 Olympics.\n\n\"America, they're the goats for a reason, you know?\" said Australian Lauren Jackson, who has played in five of those losses. \"They are full of superstars and I mean you look at the name on every single jersey out there and they are the best players in the world for a reason. They're incredible.\"\n\nJackson played 5 minutes after sitting out the last two games and didn't score. The 43-year-old Jackson hasn't contributed much in this Olympics, but the fact she's still playing is a near miracle itself after she retired due to injuries in 2016.\n\nJackson made a return for the Opals at the 2022 World Cup, helping the team earn bronze there. Now she'll hope that the team can get one more win Sunday to medal - something the Australians have done in each of the four other Olympics she's competed in.\n\nThe U.S. will be looking for another gold.\n\n\"I'm so proud of us,\" Reeve said. \"You know, the evolution that we've made as a team. And I'm excited that we've got ... to the last stand, if you will, in this campaign. (Now) see if we can get the gold.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source":

The mighty USA, the unstoppable USA, the USA which just completed another 21-point victory over Australia, consigning the Opals to a battle for bronze instead of a shot at gold.\n\nIt's been 40 years since an Australian women's basketball team first played the USA at the Olympic Games. The two nations have met in this arena on eight occasions previously, with the Americans winning all eight -- you can now make that nine from nine.\n\nThree of those were in gold medal matches, another in a semifinal and most recently in Tokyo a quarterfinal. It is probably the most significant international rivalry in the women's game, as these two nations were at the forefront of the rise in the women's game and played some spiteful and special games around the turn of the century.\n\nBut it has been painfully one-sided.\n\nJackson has had to live through most of those defeats, first as a teenage tyro in Sydney, then as the star of the team and now as its heart and soul.\n\nSurrounded by young women and players whose careers are just on the verge of taking off, she is a fountain of knowledge while also carrying the scars of all of those crushing losses.\n\nSo what's one more for good measure?\n\nThe Opals found themselves down by double-digits inside four minutes of game time. At about the same point, the US had already blocked three shots and made three steals -- it was an overpowering, strength and size putting up an impassable roadblock.\n\nThe issues were just as pronounced at the other end, with the Opals relying on the Americans missing open shots in order to get a stop.\n\nWithout being dramatic, for most of that first quarter it felt as if a blowout was inevitable.\n\nThe Opals battled back in the first but by half-time trailed by 18 points, somewhat fortunate to be that close.\n\nThe Americans entered this game on the back of a 59-game winning streak at the Olympic Games. Fifty-nine games.\n\nThe last time a US women's basketball team lost at the Olympics was in the semifinals in Barcelona, 1992. Only three members of the current team were alive when that game was played, and only 42-year-old captain Diana Taurasi has any hope of remembering it.\n\nWomen's basketball in the US is enjoying a surge in popularity and exposure, largely off the back of the performances of rookie sensation Caitlin Clark in the WNBA.\n\nClark's omission from this US squad remains baffling and threatened to prove a distraction for the players selected, though on all evidence supplied they don't seem to be having too many issues.\n\nA'ja Wilson was the chief disruptor on the defensive end, supported by the twin towers of Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier.\n\nEvery time Sami Whitcomb, Jade Melbourne or Steph Talbot looked to drive towards the paint they were met with immediate and impenetrable defiance.\n\nFor all of Australia's endeavour, the Opals were physically outmatched from the outset. They were bullied by Brittney Griner and co in the second half as the US looked to make a statement, both with some vicious screens and a bit of offensive showboating.\n\nBut the Opals also let themselves down with sloppy turnovers and poor shooting.\n\nPerfection was required to break this Olympic drought and force the upset of the tournament, and unfortunately the Opals were some way short of that mark.\n\nOf course, this encounter could have been avoided entirely had Australia not started the campaign in the fashion it did.\n\nThe opening loss to Nigeria was a bolt from the blue, a performance so poor it caught everybody off guard and was labelled \"a disaster\" by Jackson.\n\nThe Opals have shown serious resilience to bounce back from that body blow in remaining group games and a terrific quarterfinal win over Serbia. but had that form not taken a game to arrive it could have been Belgium in this semi, not the arch enemy.\n\nBut if Australia is to some day find that breakthrough Olympic gold, this streak will have to be ended.\n\nThe record now sits at 9-0 in the US's favour, with win number 60 in a row taking the Americans to another gold medal match. Bronze is on the cards for Australia, but it had come to Paris with aspirations of more.\n\nThe bulk of this Opals side is young and plying its trade in America in the burgeoning WNBA. There will be natural growth between now and LA, but right now it's hard to see anything other than a widening gap between these two old foes.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news",

I mean, they just told me when I was doing TV that it was, like, before I was born that it kind of started, which is wild,\" Stewart said. \"It just goes to show those that have really paved the way and to create USA Basketball and what it is now. Tons of appreciation for that and knowing that when you represent this jersey and wear USA across your chest the standard is high and there really is nothing higher.\"\n\nAnd the team didn't disappoint some notable onlookers, including Sue Bird, Dawn Staley, Kevin Durant and Vanessa Bryant and her children.\n\nAfter the business-like semifinal win in which the U.S. started strong and never took its foot off the gas, the Americans will face either France or Belgium for the title. The U.S. is trying to become the first team -- in any sport -- to win eight consecutive Olympic gold medals, breaking the tie with the U.S. men's program that won seven in a row from 1936-68.\n\nThe U.S. was able to take control of the game in the first half allowing coach Cheryl Reeve the opportunity to play her starters limited minutes, give players on the bench more court time, so everyone will be fresh and mentally set for the gold medal game.\n\n\"The group that's going to be out there is going to be a little more ready and rested to be able to give everything they had,\" Reeve said.\n\nA win Sunday would be a record sixth gold medal for Diana Taurasi. A game after not starting for the first time since the 2004 Olympics, the Americans' most decorated Olympic basketball player didn't enter the game until 2:08 remained in the third quarter with the U.S. up 63-40. She missed her two shots, playing just a little over 6 minutes.\n\nThe U.S. jumped out to an early lead on Australia, but only were up 20-16 after the opening quarter. The Americans put the game away in the second quarter, starting the period with a 12-0 run. The U.S. led 45-27 at the half.\n\nJackie Young added 14 points, Kahleah Copper 11 and A'ja WIlson 10 for the Americans.\n\nIsobel Borlase led Australia with 11, and Tess Madgen and Ezi Magbegor each had 10.\n\nThere was no shortage of WNBA players on the court.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nBut while the American team features 12 WNBA All-Stars who have won multiple MVPs, the Australia roster is full of complimentary players in the league. The Opals, who started five current WNBA players, just didn't have enough offensive firepower to compete with the U.S. juggernaut.\n\nIn the end, the U.S. once again denied the Australians a chance at a gold medal in what's been a one-sided affair between the teams. The Opals have never beaten the U.S. in Olympic competition, losing in the gold medal game in 2000, '04 and '08.\n\n\"We had to play a perfect game today. I always say you got to believe that you can\" beat the U.S., Australia coach Sandy Brondello said. \"But nine times out of 10, there's one game where you maybe can get them on a bad day. And it wasn't our best day here.\"\n\nThe Australians also lost to the U.S. in the semifinals of the 1996 and 2012 Olympics.\n\n\"America, they're the goats for a reason, you know?\" said Australian Lauren Jackson, who has played in five of those losses. \"They are full of superstars and I mean you look at the name on every single jersey out there and they are the best players in the world for a reason. They're incredible.\"\n\nJackson played 5 minutes after sitting out the last two games and didn't score. The 43-year-old Jackson hasn't contributed much in this Olympics, but the fact she's still playing is a near miracle itself after she retired due to injuries in 2016.\n\nJackson made a return for the Opals at the 2022 World Cup, helping the team earn bronze there. Now she'll hope that the team can get one more win Sunday to medal -- something the Australians have done in each of the four other Olympics she's competed in.\n\nThe U.S. will be looking for another gold.\n\n\"I'm so proud of us,\" Reeve said. \"You know, the evolution that we've made as a team. And I'm excited that we've got ... to the last stand, if you will, in this campaign. (Now) see if we can get the gold.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"},

In fact they played each other for the Olympic Gold in 2000, 2004 and 2008. The Opals have also won the FiBA Women's World Cup in 2006 when Team USA won bronze that time.\n\nWhy am I writing about events from 20 or more years ago here? It's because Opals center Lauren Jackson and Team USA guard Diana Taurus have been on their national teams for all in Jackson's case, and nearly all of those battles in Taurasi's because she was just entering college in 2000. This appears to be the last Olympics for both given that both are above 40 years old and are still performing professionally!\n\nToday's Opals are led by Alanna Smith, Ezi Magbegor, Sami Whitcomb and Washington Mystics guard Jade Melbourne. And Team USA is led by A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and a bunch of other WNBA All-Stars. I get it, this is supposed to be the Australians' funeral march.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. The Opals have a lot of WNBA talent. They also are a bit more used to playing with each other than the Americans. Finally, the crowd in Paris will likely root for the Opals because they are underdogs.\n\nIn some ways, the Opals have advanced farther than many expected before these games began.

Olympic winning streak of 60 consecutive matches since the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\n\"The streak is crazy. I mean, they just told me when I was doing TV that it started before I was born, which is wild,\" Stewart said. \"It just shows who really paved the way and created USA Basketball and what it is today. So much appreciation for that and knowing that when you're representing USA and wearing this jersey on your chest, the standard is high and there really is nothing higher.\"\n\nAnd the team did not disappoint some notable spectators, including Sue Bird, Dawn Staley, Kevin Durant and Vanessa Bryant and her children.\n\nAfter a businesslike semifinal victory in which the U.S. started strong and never let up, the Americans will now face either France or Belgium for the title. The U.S. is attempting to become the first team -- in any sport -- to win eight consecutive Olympic gold medals, breaking a tie with the U.S. men's program, which won seven in a row from 1936-68.\n\nThe US was able to control the game in the first half, allowing coach Cheryl Reeve to limit her starting players to a limited number of minutes and give the bench players more playing time, leaving everyone fresh and mentally prepared for the gold medal battle.\n\n\"The group that goes out there will be a little more prepared and equipped to give it everything they've got,\" Reeve said.\n\nA win on Sunday would mark Diana Taurasi's record sixth gold medal. A game after not starting for the first time since the 2004 Olympics, the U.S.'s most decorated Olympic basketball player didn't enter the game until 2:08 remaining in the third quarter with the U.S. leading 63-40. She missed both of her shots and played just over six minutes.\n\nThe U.S. took an early lead over Australia, but led only 20-16 after the first quarter. The Americans decided the game in the second quarter, starting the period on a 12-0 run. The U.S. led 45-27 at halftime.\n\nJackie Young added 14 points, Kahleah Copper 11 and A'ja Wilson 10 for the Americans.\n\nIsobel Borlase led Australia with 11 points, with Tess Madgen and Ezi Magbegor each having 10.\n\nThere was no shortage of WNBA players on the court.\n\nBut while the U.S. team has 12 WNBA All-Stars who have won multiple MVPs, the Australian roster is loaded with complementary players in the league. The Opals, who started five current WNBA players, simply didn't have the offensive firepower to compete with the American juggernaut.\n\nUltimately, the U.S. denied the Australians another shot at a gold medal in what has been a one-sided affair between the teams. The Opals have never defeated the U.S. in Olympic competition, losing in the gold medal game in 2000, '04 and '08.\n\n\"We had to play a perfect game today. I always say you have to believe you can beat the US,\" Australian coach Sandy Brondello said. \"But nine times out of 10, there's one game where you can beat them on a bad day. And it wasn't our best day here.\"\n\nThe Australians also lost to the US in the semi-finals of the 1996 and 2012 Olympic Games.\n\n\"America, they're the goats for a reason, you know?\" said Australian Lauren Jackson, who has played in five of those losses. \"They're full of superstars and I mean, you look at the name on every shirt there is and they're the best players in the world for a reason. They're unbelievable.\"\n\nJackson played 5 minutes after sitting out the last two games and not scoring. The 43-year-old Jackson hasn't contributed much to these Olympics, but the fact that she's still playing is a almost a miracle in itself after she retired in 2016 due to injuries.\n\nJackson made a comeback for the Opals at the 2022 World Championships, helping the team win bronze. Now she's hoping the team can pull out one more win on Sunday to secure a medal -- something the Australians have done at each of the other four Olympic Games she's competed in.\n\nThe US will be looking for even more gold.\n\n\"I'm so proud of us,\" Reeve said. \"You know, the evolution that we've had as a team. And I'm excited that we've ... come to the final stand, if you will, in this campaign.

The way they've stepped up and come together has been remarkable, I'm very proud.\n\n\"We've got a lot of players in the WNBA right now who play big roles on their teams and I think that's really going to benefit us, it really does count for something.\"\n\nJackson played just under 13 minutes, for six points, two rebounds and a steal, against Nigeria on August 29, then eight and a half minutes three days later in Australia's win over Canada.\n\nShe hasn't got on the court in the past two games, wins over France on Monday morning and Serbia on Wednesday night, but confirmed to ESPN she isn't injured.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. In terms of the rotations, I think the girls have a great chemistry out there and are playing great basketball and I'm happy just to play my role and I knew it was going to be like this coming in.\n\n\"I'm supporting the girls and giving them everything. I'm really excited to be a part of it and play whatever my role is which doesn't bother me either way.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia women's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lauren Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Melbourne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jade Melbourne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Screen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Screen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinda_Snell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belinda Snell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penny Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0809%2Fr1370889_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802963", "eventUri": "eng-9802963", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-29", "textStart": 3332, "textEnd": 3341}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Following an upset loss to Nigeria in their Olympic opener, the Opals have strung together three straight victories, including Wednesday's 85-67 quarterfinal decision over Serbia.\n\nWhile the U.S. women have been the gold standard for basketball across the world, winning seven consecutive Olympic gold medals and nine overall, Australia has been a historic powerhouse alongside them. The Opals have medaled in five of the past seven Summer Games, taking home three silvers and two bronze, although their semifinal run in Paris marks the first time they've advanced past the quarterfinals since the 2012 London Games.\n\n2012 also was the last time the legendary Lauren Jackson suited up on the Olympic stage for the green and gold -- until now. While Team USA has 42-year-old, six-time Olympian Diana Taurasi, the Opals have Jackson, 43, appearing in her fifth Games and first in 12 years. Jackson has always medaled in the competition, and though she has seen limited action so far in France, she has a chance to continue that streak this weekend.\n\nAustralia -- which boasts six active WNBA players -- has plenty of momentum, but the Opals are 0-20 all time against the U.S. senior national team, including 0-8 in Olympic competition. During the five Games in which they medaled, Australia lost to the U.S. either in the semifinals or the gold medal contest. The squads last met in 2020, when the Americans prevailed 79-55.\n\nESPN's Alexa Philippou and Kevin Pelton break down some of the pressing questions heading into the matchup.\n\nTeam USA switched up its starting five against Nigeria, with Jackie Young in place of Diana Taurasi. Did the move fix its issues in the backcourt?\n\nPhilippou: Starting Young in place of Taurasi -- who had last come off the bench at the Olympics in 2004 -- was the right move. With 15 points against Nigeria, Young appears to be carving out a role as Team USA's third scorer behind A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart. (Indeed, Young is the only other U.S. player averaging double figures at 10.3 points per game.) Young, one of three Las Vegas Aces players in the starting five, showed off her 3-point shooting earlier against Germany, going 5-of-8. But while she went scoreless from deep on Wednesday, it was her ability to get downhill and hit from midrange that stood out, along with her trademark defense in the backcourt. It took until the middle of the second quarter for the U.S. to really put its foot on the gas against Nigeria, but Young's aggression and energy on both ends should continue to pay dividends. And Taurasi seemed to do well off the bench, where she stepped up as a facilitator with four assists.\n\nPelton: I'd love to see starting point guard Chelsea Gray be a threat to score. She missed all three of her shot attempts in the quarterfinals, bringing Gray to 1-of-13 so far during the Olympics. Remarkably, the U.S. outscored Nigeria by just two points in Gray's 17:27, while all four other starters had a plus-minus of plus-17 or better while on the court.\n\nStill, as I mentioned in our last roundtable, the U.S. women can overcome one non-scorer in the starting five so long as she is bringing something else to the table. And Gray is with her playmaking, having now totaled 22 assists against just three turnovers. So, I don't think coach Cheryl Reeve needs to make further changes.\n\nWhat problems do the Australians pose, and what could make them a tough matchup?\n\nPhilippou: WNBA fans will be well familiar with this Opals squad, which features the Seattle Storm's Ezi Magbegor and Sami Whitcomb, Minnesota Lynx's Alanna Smith, Los Angeles Sparks' Stephanie Talbot, Washington Mystics' Jade Melbourne and Indiana Fever's Kristy Wallace, plus New York Liberty coach Sandy Brondello at the helm. Not only do the Opals have the talent to compete against Team USA. They have momentum and resolve following their disappointing start to the Olympics. Brondello has been pleased with her team's poise and grit over the past week, two qualities an opponent needs when facing the Americans.\n\nThe Opals, whose balanced attack boasts five players averaging at least 8.0 PPG, can hurt foes inside with Magbegor and Smith but also from the 3-point arc. Their 36.9% 3-point clip is the best in the Olympic field and much higher than Team USA's paltry 30.8%. Whitcomb and Cayla George, a 2023 WNBA champion while with the Las Vegas Aces, lead the team with eight and seven treys, respectively.\n\nPelton: On paper, Australia is deeper and more talented than any team in the field save for the U.S. women. We can debate the best international player at the Paris Games, with Emma Meesseman (Belgium) and Satou Sabally (Germany) as strong candidates. But no team has a pair of players as good as the Opals' frontcourt duo of Magbegor and Smith, both of whom would have been on my WNBA All-Star team this year. (Magbegor, a 2023 All-Star, was not named to the team this season despite similar production.) And no team outside the U.S. has nearly as much WNBA experience throughout its roster.\n\nGiven all that talent, it was shocking when Australia lost its opening game to Nigeria then barely beat winless Canada. In their past two games, we've seen the Opals we expected, as they beat topped France to advance to the knockout stage and led Serbia by as many as 28 in a lopsided quarterfinal victory.\n\nCan anyone stop Breanna Stewart and A'ja Wilson?\n\nPelton: No. But if anyone is going to contain them, it's the duo of Magbegor and Smith. Australia's post players rank second (Magbegor, 2.4) and fourth (Smith, 1.8) in the WNBA in blocks per game and have the mobility to defend Stewart and Wilson on the perimeter. Magbegor is particularly experienced against both opponents, having faced Stewart in practice for three years as Storm teammates and matched up with Wilson in the 2022 WNBA semifinals.\n\nThe biggest obstacle for Magbegor and Smith is foul trouble. Magbegor picked up three first-half fouls against Canada, and Smith had two in the first quarter versus France, limiting their minutes. Backup George is a tough, skilled player (she scored 18 points in 24 minutes against Serbia) but nowhere near as athletic on defense.\n\nPhilippou: Pelton brings up a valid concern. But given the experience Stewart and Wilson have at this stage -- Stewart is going for her third Olympic gold and Wilson her second, while Magbegor and Smith are appearing in their first Games -- I'd expect the Team USA super duo to make the winning plays necessary in such a high-pressure situation to advance to the final.\n\nWhich of France and Belgium would be a tougher opponent for Team USA?\n\nPelton: I'm going with Belgium, which gave the U.S. women their toughest Olympic test yet. The Americans prevailed by 13 points, although the margin was just seven entering the fourth quarter of a group stage game played in Lille, France, near the border with Belgium. All this despite Belgium going just 5-of-27 in 3-point shooting, with Julie Vanloo particularly struggling from downtown while missing 10 of her 11 attempts. On Wednesday, the Mystics point guard went 3-of-5 from 3, scoring 13 points with seven assists (albeit with nine turnovers) as Belgium cruised past Spain, the only other team besides the U.S. that was unbeaten in pool play.\n\nPhilippou: As the host country with the crowd on its side and plenty of pride on the line, a difficult defensive team in France wouldn't be a pushover, either, especially if Marine Johannes can go off like she did against Germany with 24 points off the bench and with Gabby Williams leading the way on both ends.\n\nHas Team USA played its best basketball yet?\n\nPhilippou: In-game consistency, especially on offense, can still be an issue. There are times when the lack of playing time together or Reeve's tweaking with rotations/combinations is still apparent. After all, there's a reason why Sue Bird recently said on Carmelo Anthony's podcast that USA Basketball is the most uncomfortable basketball she has ever played. After a bit of a slow start, the U.S. eventually led by 30 in the third quarter against Nigeria, but Reeve couldn't have loved how her team allowed the D'Tigress to make it a 14-point game before the final buzzer. Through four games, the Americans' lack of 3-point shooting hasn't really been remedied, which could be an issue if opponents get hot from deep.\n\nTeam USA can't overlook any of the remaining teams in the field, but with a defensive identity and offensive prowess led by Stewart and Wilson, it has shown it can put games away when it needs to, something that should transfer over into the final two games.\n\nPelton: On the flip side, I think the shooting is also reason to believe there's another gear for the U.S. women. Collectively, the 12 players on the roster have combined to shoot 33% on 3-point attempts in the WNBA this season. That won't earn a \"Splash Sisters\" nickname any time soon, but it's also better than Team USA has managed from the shorter 3-point line in FIBA play.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType":

The game tips off on Friday, Aug. 9 at 11:30 a.m. ET (NBC).\n\nThe United States remains unbeaten, whereas Australia lost its opening game to Nigeria. It was a wake-up call for the Opals. The 13-point loss on July 29 exposed certain flaws in their game, especially not handling the ball properly, as evidenced by the 26 turnovers committed against D'Tigress. After tough wins over Canada and France, by five and seven points, respectively, the Opals made it out of Group B. And after beating Serbia in the quarterfinals, the reward for their hard work is a chance to become No. 60 in Team USA's streak of consecutive Olympic wins.\n\nThe Americans had their quarterfinal game won after three quarters and in the final 10 minutes they were just having fun with it, as head coach Cheryl Reeve gave playing time to some battle-hungry players. Chances of the semifinal game being competitive aren't good, as it would take a perfect performance from the Opals and an off night from Team USA.\n\nThe frontcourt duo of A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart has been unstoppable so far, with Wilson averaging 20.3 points and 10 rebounds and Stewart chipping in 18.5 points and 5.8 boards. If there's a anybody that can slow them down, it's the combined forces of Alanna Smith, Steph Talbot and Ezi Magbegor. Smith has been dependable on both sides of the floor (12.3 points, 7.3 boards, 1.8 steals), but against Serbia she balled like crazy, finishing the game with 22 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nOn the defensive end, the key to beating the Opals will be limiting Sami Whitcomb's playmaking. The two-time WNBA champ is averaging 14.8 points and six dimes per game. Because she can pass and score, tight marking will be essential.

But there were signs that Australia might just end the streak at Los Angeles or Brisbane, given promise shown by young players Ezi Magbegor and 19-year-old guard Izzy Borlase, who top scored for the Opals with 11 points.\n\nMembers of the US men's team in the audience, including Kevin Durant and Bam Adebayo, were treated to an early display of American dominance, and the result was largely secured in the second quarter, when the USA pushed their lead to more than 20 behind dominant defence.\n\nAt half-time they had seven steals and five blocks, as well as countless deflections that wreaked havoc with the Australians' offence. The green jerseys were limited to just 27 points at the half, while the US had 14 points off turnovers, and 18 fast break points, and were making Australia pay for their mistakes.\n\nIt set the scene for a procession in the second half that passed largely without incident. The Americans were rarely threatened, keeping their lead around 20 until the final whistle. Breanna Stewart top scored with 16, while Jackie Young added another 14.\n\nThe bright spot for the Australians was the play of 19-year-old guard Borlase, who was given an extended run and finished with 11 points. The Opals' younger generation, including Magbegor and Melbourne showed signs of promise against a team made up of some of the best. And Alanna Smith - who at 27 is just coming into her prime - worked hard inside against her rangy American match-ups and is likely to be a key player for Los Angeles 2028.\n\nThis will be the last Olympics for 43-year-old Lauren Jackson, however. She got run in the first quarter and was largely limited to long jump shots, but her entry coincided with a run that cut into an early American lead. Her role was largely off the bench in the second half, before she shared an embrace with US football star Megan Rapinoe as the players cleared the court.\n\nThe Opals will still finish the Paris Games with a chance to win the bronze medal, an improvement on Tokyo where their loss to the US in the quarter-finals eliminated them before the medal matches.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

for the Americans' physicality and athleticism around the rim, Opals tumbling to the pine a common sight on Friday at the Bercy Arena.\n\nTheir Olympic head-to-head record now reads 9-0 and the US are on a 60-match Games streak as they seek an eighth-straight title on Sunday.\n\nOnly twice on that run, since 1992, have they won by less than 10 points.\n\nJackie Young (14 points) and A'ja Wilson (10 points, eight rebounds) started well before two-time Olympic champion Breanna Stewart (16 points, six rebounds, five assists) took over.\n\nCaptain Tess Madgen (10) held her own while 19-year-old Isobel Borlase (11 points) impressed when given the chance in the final quarter.\n\nThere was plenty of feeling in it for an Opals side coached by New York Liberty boss Sandy Brondello and boasting seven current WNBA players in the side, plus former league great and Hall of Famer Lauren Jackson.\n\nBut they were shaky to begin, six turnovers and three blocked shots allowing the US to race out by 10 points in the first five minutes.\n\nMadgen steadied with five quick points and an expert Sami Whitcomb assist to a cutting Jade Melbourne got them within two points approaching quarter time.\n\nLauren Jackson's first-quarter injection, mostly to guard Brittney Griner, also seemed to spark the side as confidence swelled.\n\nIt was promptly eaten up by the US though, who denied any good Australia looks to began the second quarter and racked up 14-straight points to put the game to bed just minutes into that period.\n\nJewell Lloyd's triple made it 30-16, Cayla George nailing a triple in front of the spectating US men's stars Kevin Durant and Bam Adebeyo a rare highlight of a 25-11 quarter.\n\nThe Opals tried to attack the rim but were constantly shut down, bouncing off stationary US bodies and unable to earn a free throw until the final quarter.\n\nThe Americans bossed the boards, winning rebounds 46-34 and points in the paint 44-28.\n\nThe loss busted a brilliant three-game winning streak that had resuscitated the Opals after a horror first-up defeat to Nigeria.\n\nThey'll play the winner of France and Belgium in Sunday's bronze medal game.\n\nAustralia is chasing a return to the podium for the first time since 2012, when they clinched a fifth-straight minor placing in London.\n\nJackson, 43 and in her fifth Olympic campaign, received post-game hugs from her US rivals and retired US soccer star Megan Rapinoe, who was among the stars sitting courtside.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

But after Jackson's Aussies fell 85-64 to the dominant U.S. women on Friday, the outpouring of support and respect from her opponents felt like another Hall-of-Fame induction ceremony for a player who's already enshrined in all of them.\n\nNot bad for someone who played five total minutes and didn't score any points on Friday.\n\nWhen her admirers from the other team slowly made their way back to the locker room. Jackson stood pensively in a bright-yellow warm up shirt, her yellow 'Opals' jersey with number 25 in green visible underneath it. Jackson, like the rest of her teammates, realized they ran into a juggernaut just minutes into Friday's one-sided matchup against their longtime rivals.\n\nJackson and the Aussies still have a chance to medal, as they'll play the loser of Friday's semifinal game between France and Belgium for bronze on Sunday at 11:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. PT).\n\nShe admits a bronze medal in her Olympic send-off would mean everything.\n\n\"It's a dream come true just to be back here,\" she said. \"I'm appreciating every minute. The Americans are a special team, and just to fight hard against them is a good sign for us.\"\n\nJackson has hardly been the player she was last time she stepped on the Olympic floor, at London 2012. She's averaging two points, one rebound and a steal per game in Paris, having played in just three of Australia's five contests. That's compared to 18.4 points, 7.1 boards, 1.4 assists and 1.1 steals over 32 minutes per game across her first four Olympics.\n\nHer time on the floor in the first half Friday -- after back-to-back DNPs against France and Serbia -- almost felt like a sign of respect from Opals coach Sandy Bordello. Jackson showed, at this point in her career, she lacks the strength and speed needed to score against the likes of the world's best forwards in A'ja Wilson and former Storm MVP Breanna Stewart. Yet, Jackson is still a favorite among her younger Australia teammates, some of whom remain in awe of her.\n\n\"She's a legend,\" said current Storm center Ezi Magbegor, who's following in her idol's footsteps playing for both the Storm and the Australian national team. \"Just her being here, you can feel the difference. There's a reverence for her that lifts us and just motivates us to give everything we have.\"\n\nIt's a perfect illustration of why Jackson is in France this month, on an Olympic roster for the first time in 12 years. She's the first to admit she's a step slower than during her \"first career,\" where she won two WNBA titles with the Storm and earned three league MVPs from 2001 to 2012. Jackson's \"second career,\" which started less than three years ago at the age of 40, has her leading her Aussie teammates by example, and building a culture for the next group of Opal stars.\n\nJackson earned medals in each of her first four Olympics with Australia, and hopes to leave Paris with a fifth. In the two Olympics she missed -- Rio and Tokyo -- the Opals failed to reach the podium.\n\n\"I knew that I was going to be sitting on the bench a lot, and that my role is giving confidence and mentoring and being there when I get an opportunity to get out there and be physical,\" Jackson said. \"I feel like I'm doing what's asked of me, and I'm fine with that,\"\n\nJackson's coach added that her impact in Paris has gone far beyond the hardwood.\n\n\"I think the respect for Lauren transcends the actual on-court game,\" Bordello said. \"She makes everyone in our program better from the way she handles herself to the way she approaches games and prepares.\"\n\nNever say never?\n\nJackson's 27-year career with the Australian national team dates all the way back before her first Olympics, the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney -- where she won a silver medal after losing to, guess who, the United States. She's 'at peace' with her role in Paris and 'content' with a career resume that easily ranks her among the best women's basketball players of all-time. Jackson claims these Olympics are the end of her second career.\n\nBut will she be back as a player?\n\nIt's a fair question, given her love for the game and history of retiring only to return to the hardwood. A series of major knee and achilles injuries forced her to call it quits for the first time in early 2016, at age 35. She came back in 2022 to play professionally in Australia, but retired again after tearing her achilles in February 2023.\n\nShe healed, and unretired, in time to help the Opals qualify for the Paris Olympics back in February, then retired again. When Australia announced its Olympic roster last month, though, Jackson's name was on it.\n\n\"I was just going day by day with the training and it just sort of happened organically,\" she said. \"I wanted the girls to succeed, and I wanted to be a part of a winning team. And we are a winning team.\"\n\nShe insists this is it. Jackson gave birth to two sons shortly after retiring for the first time, and said she wants to spend more time with them as they grow up.\n\nUntil then, she's just enjoying the ride. And pitching in where she can.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/08092024_tzr_tzr_122024.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802963", "eventUri": "eng-9802963", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The deans were placed on leave shortly after the texts surfaced.\n\nColumbia University President Minouche Shafik said last month that the texts echoed \"ancient antisemitic tropes.\" At the time, the university said the administrators involved had been \"permanently removed from their positions,\" but it was unclear whether they would take on other roles at the university. A Columbia spokesperson confirmed to the New York Jewish Week on Thursday that the three deans were resigning.\n\nThe three deans who resigned are Susan Chang-Kim, the university's vice dean and chief administrative officer; Cristen Kromm, a dean of undergraduate student life; and Matthew Patashnick, an associate vice dean for student and family support. The deans' resignation was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nA fourth dean who was involved in one of the text exchanges has apologized and acknowledged that the conversations \"call to mind antisemitic tropes.\" That administrator, the dean of Columbia College, Josef Sorett, has not resigned.

Another sent vomit emojis in reaction to the mention of a college newspaper opinion piece written by one of the school's rabbis.\n\nThe deans did not respond to calls requesting comment. Samantha Slater, a Columbia spokesperson, confirmed the resignations by email but did not provide further comment.\n\nThe episode, which became public in June when an attendee shared her pictures of one of the dean's cellphones with The Washington Free Beacon, has been deeply embarrassing to the administration. University leaders have been trying to convince Congress, alumni and its own Jewish students that it takes antisemitism on campus seriously.\n\nThe turmoil over a scandal some alumni are calling \"textgate\" comes as Shafik and other administrators prepare for how they will respond to what they expect will be another powerful wave of pro-Palestinian activism in the fall.\n\nIn a sign of the university's challenges, pro-Palestinian vandals attacked the Brooklyn Heights apartment building of the university's chief operating officer, Cas Holloway, early Thursday morning, splashing red paint on the floor and releasing insects into the lobby, police said.\n\nBefore fleeing after 3 a.m., four people plastered posters outside the building showing Holloway with devil ears and behind bars. Another poster said, \"You signed off on police brutality. Now you want to expel us?\" A glass door pane was also shattered, and upside-down red triangles, a symbol of the Palestinian resistance, were painted around the door.\n\nPolice are investigating, and so far there have been no arrests.\n\nIn preparation for the new school year, Shafik has announced that there will be a new mediation process for some issues involving protesters, community dialogues and a review of protest rules.\n\nMore moves are also being discussed, including possibly giving some campus police new powers to make arrests, which is common for officers at other universities. The idea was first reported in The Wall Street Journal, but no formal proposal has been presented to the University Senate, which would normally be consulted before such a change.\n\n\"Columbia has public safety, but basically they can't physically confront anybody,\" said James Applegate, an astronomy professor and member of the executive committee of the University Senate, who said the idea was discussed informally this spring. \"So Columbia's options are, for all intents and purposes, ask politely or go nuclear,\" by calling in the New York Police Department, he said.\n\nThe three deans who resigned -- Susan Chang-Kim, the college's vice dean and chief administrative officer; Cristen Kromm, the dean of undergraduate student life; and Matthew Patashnick, the associate dean for student and family support -- were not faculty members and did not have tenure protections.\n\nIn a July note to the Columbia community, Shafik described the sentiments in the text messages as \"unacceptable and deeply upsetting, conveying a lack of seriousness about the concerns and the experiences of members of our Jewish community.\" She said the messages \"disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes\" and were \"antithetical to our university's values.\"\n\nThe episode occurred May 31, in the aftermath of student protests that led to mass arrests twice on Columbia's campus this spring. Columbia hosted a panel discussion called \"Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present and Future.\" The panel's speakers included Brian Cohen, the executive director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel, the Jewish students organization, and David Schizer, the former dean of the law school and a chair of the university's antisemitism task force.\n\nThe three administrators, along with the dean of Columbia College, Josef Sorett, were in the audience. A person sitting behind Chang-Kim photographed the text messages she was exchanging with her colleagues. A transcript of the exchanges was later released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which has been investigating antisemitism on college campuses.\n\nSorett also participated in the text exchanges, though to a lesser extent. After the incident, he sent an apology note to the community. Sorett, a scholar on religion and race, is a tenured professor, which gives him protections that make it harder to remove him from the faculty. He will continue in his position.\n\n\"I am deeply sorry that this happened in a community that I lead and, that I was part of any of the exchanges,\" Sorett wrote in his note.\n\nHe could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday.\n\nA petition signed by more than 2,000 students, alumni, and parents has called on the college to also remove Sorett for his role in the incident. At one point during the text exchanges, Sorett responded with the term \"LMAO\" -- or laughing my ass off -- when Chang-Kim said of Columbia's Hillel director, Brian Cohen, \"He is our hero.\"\n\nThe incident confirmed the worst fears of some Jewish students who were disturbed by how anti-Israel protests on campus were being handled.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dean (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Heights"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Heights"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Free_Beacon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Free Beacon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campus police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schizer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Schizer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/0L96__qTtU7_RlNMoGs30eZpdl4=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/OCNEGGIFBS7RPCMI2Q5ETPUCWM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802862", "eventUri": "eng-9802862", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-31", "textStart": 3425, "textEnd": 3431}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Bing Guan/The New York Times\n\nThree Columbia University deans who exchanged disparaging text messages that the university president said \"touched on ancient antisemitic tropes\" during a forum about Jewish issues in May are resigning, a spokesperson said Thursday.\n\nThe deans, who had responsibility for undergraduate student affairs, sent the biting and sarcastic messages as they reacted in real time to Jewish speakers expressing concern about antisemitism on campus during the two-hour event.\n\nIn June, Minouche Shafik, the university president, placed the three deans on indefinite leave as an investigation proceeded.\n\nIn the texts, one dean suggested that a Jewish speaker was playing up concerns for fundraising purposes. Another sent vomit emojis in reaction to the mention of a college newspaper opinion piece written by one of the school's rabbis.\n\nThe deans did not respond to calls requesting comment. Samantha Slater, a Columbia spokesperson, confirmed the resignations by email but did not provide further comment.\n\nThe episode, which became public in June when an attendee shared her pictures of one of the dean's cellphones with The Washington Free Beacon, has been deeply embarrassing to the administration. University leaders have been trying to convince Congress, alumni and its own Jewish students that it takes antisemitism on campus seriously.\n\nThe turmoil over a scandal some alumni are calling \"textgate\" comes as Shafik and other administrators prepare for how they will respond to what they expect will be another powerful wave of pro-Palestinian activism in the fall.\n\nIn a sign of the university's challenges, pro-Palestinian vandals attacked the Brooklyn Heights apartment building of the university's chief operating officer, Cas Holloway, early Thursday morning, splashing red paint on the floor and releasing insects into the lobby, police said.\n\nThe three deans who resigned -- Susan Chang-Kim, the college's vice dean and chief administrative officer; Cristen Kromm, the dean of undergraduate student life; and Matthew Patashnick, the associate dean for student and family support -- were not faculty members and did not have tenure protections.\n\nThe dean of Columbia College, Josef Sorett, also participated in the text exchanges, though to a lesser extent. After the incident, he sent an apology note to the community. Sorett, a scholar on religion and race, is a tenured professor, which gives him protections that make it harder to remove him from the faculty.

A Columbia spokesperson confirmed to the New York Jewish Week on Thursday that the three deans were resigning.</p>\n\n<p>The three deans who resigned are Susan Chang-Kim, the university's vice dean and chief administrative officer; Cristen Kromm, a dean of undergraduate student life; and Matthew Patashnick, an associate vice dean for student and family support. The deans' resignation was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/nyregion/columbia-university-deans-resign-text-messages-antisemitism.html\">The New York Times</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A fourth dean who was involved in one of the text exchanges has apologized and acknowledged that the conversations \"call to mind antisemitic tropes.\" That administrator, the dean of Columbia College, Josef Sorett, has not resigned. A Columbia spokesperson did not respond to a request for information about Sorett's status, or for further details about the resignations. More than 1,000 Columbia alumni have demanded Sorett's removal in a petition.</p>\n\n<p>The text message exchanges took place while the administrators were attending a <a href=\"https://totalwebcasting.com/view/?func=VOFF&amp;id=columbia&amp;date=2024-05-31&amp;seq=1''>May 31 panel discussion</a> titled \"Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present, and Future.\" At the panel, a Jewish student, Columbia Hillel director Brian Cohen and two other panelists discussed antisemitism at the school following Oct. 7.</p>\n\n<p>\"Comes from such a place of privilege,\" wrote Chang-Kim. \"Hard to hear the woe is me, we need to huddle at the Kraft Center,\" referring to Columbia's Jewish student center, where Hillel is housed.</p>\n\n<p>\"Yup. Blind to the idea that non-Israel supporting Jews have no space to come together,\" responded Kromm.</p>\n\n<p>While Cohen was speaking about students' efforts to gain attention, Kromm wrote \"Amazing what $$$$ can do.\" At another point while Cohen was speaking, Chang-Kim wrote, \"He is such a problem!\"</p>\n\n<p>Patashnick wrote, \"He knows exactly what he's doing and has to take full advantage of this moment. Huge fundraising potential.\"</p>\n\n<p>In a separate exchange, Chang-Kim wrote \"He is our hero\" in an apparently sarcastic message about Cohen. Nine minutes later, Sorett wrote, \"Lmao,\" an acronym denoting laughter, though whether that was a response to Chang-Kim or something else was unclear. He did not respond to a request for comment at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the text messages were first photographed by an audience member who was sitting behind one of the administrators during the panel and were first reported by <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/campus/columbia-administrators-fire-off-hostile-and-dismissive-text-messages-vomit-emojis-during-alumni-reunion-panel-on-jewish-life/\">the Washington Free Beacon</a>, a conservative news outlet.</p>\n\n<p>The House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is investigating antisemitism at Columbia and other campuses, later obtained and released the full text message exchanges.</p>\n\n<p>The chair of the committee, Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina, said in a Thursday statement that it was \"about time\" the deans resigned.</p>\n\n<p>\"Actions have consequences, and Columbia should have fired all four of these deans months ago,\" Foxx said. \"Instead, the University continues to send mixed signals, letting Columbia College Dean Josef Sorett, the highest-ranking administrator involved, slide under the radar with no real consequences.\"</p>\n\n<p>Last month, while announcing that the deans had been removed from their positions, Shafik also vowed to start a \"vigorous program of antisemitism and antidiscrimination training\" in the fall, when classes reconvene.</p>\n\n<p>\"This incident revealed behavior and sentiments that were not only unprofessional, but also, disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes,\" Shafik said in an email at that time to the campus community. \"These sentiments are unacceptable and deeply upsetting, conveying a lack of seriousness about the concerns and the experiences of members of our Jewish community.\"</p>\n\n<p>The turmoil at Columbia has continued this summer, even though classes are not in session.

Please try again later.\n\nThree Columbia University deans have resigned in the wake of controversial texts they exchanged during an alumni weekend event about Jewish life on campus, the Ivy League school confirmed Thursday.\n\nThe departures arrive a month after Columbia president Minouche Shafik told the campus community the administrators would be removed from their roles and placed on indefinite leave for texts that \"touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.\" She said the messages were troubling and the incident revealed \"deeply unsettling\" sentiments.\n\nThe university declined to comment about the resignations on Thursday, and the three administrators could not be reached. Columbia has been criticized by lawmakers, alumni and students for its handling of antisemitism amid campus protests over the Israel-Gaza war this spring.\n\nIn June, the Washington Free Beacon published photos of text messages exchanged during a panel discussion on Jewish life between the dean of Columbia College Josef Sorett, former vice dean of Columbia College Susan Chang-Kim, former dean of undergraduate student life Cristen Kromm and former associate dean for student and family support Matthew Patashnick. The conservative website said the messages were dismissive of the speakers' remarks about campus antisemitism, with one of the deans sending a vomit emoji at one point.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and the Workforce requested copies of the texts from Columbia and released them in early July.\n\nIn one text during the panel discussion titled \"Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present, and Future,\" Patashnick said a panelist, Brian Cohen, the Lavine Family Executive Director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel, was trying to \"take full advantage of this moment. Huge fundraising potential.\" In another message, Chang-Kim texted that the students' complaints \"comes from such a place of privilege ... hard to hear the woe is me.\"\n\nTranscripts of the texts released by the committee show Sorett sent three texts in response to messages from Chang-Kim, while the other deans exchanged numerous messages with one another in a group chat. Sorett was never placed on leave and remains dean of Columbia College.\n\nAfter the texts became public, Sorett wrote Columbia College students in July and said he is responsible for setting the culture and tone of the staff at the college, and that \"any language that demeans members of our community, or divides us from one another, is simply unacceptable.

University President Minouche Shafik said in a July 8 letter to the school community that the messages were unprofessional and \"disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.\"\n\n\"Whether intended as such or not, these sentiments are unacceptable and deeply upsetting,\" Shafik wrote.\n\nThe deans were first put on leave after a conservative news outlet published images of what it said were texts they exchanged while attending a May 31 panel discussion titled \"Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present and Future.\"\n\nThey have not been identified by Columbia, but their names have circulated widely in media reports.\n\nThe panel was held at an annual alumni event a month after university leaders called in police to clear pro-Palestinian protesters from an occupied administration building and dismantle a tent encampment that had threatened to disrupt graduation ceremonies.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon obtained some of the private messages through someone who attended the event and took photos of one of the deans' phones.\n\nSome included snarky comments about people in the university community. One suggested that a panelist speaking about antisemitism planned to use it as a fundraising opportunity. Another disparaged a campus rabbi's essay about antisemitism.\n\nThe administrators have not commented publicly since their exchange became public in June. Two of them -- Cristen Kromm, the former dean of undergraduate student life, and Matthew Patashnick, the former associate dean for student and family support -- did not immediately respond to phone messages seeking comment. The third, Susan Chang-Kim, could not immediately be reached.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and the Workforce has since published some of the messages.\n\nShafik has promised to launch a \"vigorous program of antisemitism and antidiscrimination training for faculty and staff\" in the fall, as well as related training for students.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Diane Bondareff/AP hide caption\n\nThree deans at Columbia University have resigned, putting an end to a saga known on campus known as \"Textgate.\" The three were removed from their positions in June ( ) after revelations that they had sent what the university called \"unacceptable and deeply upsetting\" texts that \"touched on ancient antisemitic tropes.\"\n\nA university spokesperson confirmed the resignations but offered no further comment.\n\nThe three deans were texting sarcastic and mocking messages about students' complaints of antisemitism during a panel discussion on Jewish life on campus last May. The texts were photographed by someone sitting behind one of the deans, and first reported by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, before they were publicly released by a congressional committee investigating allegations of antisemitism at Columbia.\n\nSusan Chang-Kim, formerly the vice dean and chief administrative officer of the undergraduate school Columbia College, disparaged the students' complaints, texting that it \"comes from such a place of privilege... hard to hear the woe is me.\"\n\nMatthew Patashnick, formerly the associate dean for student and family support, suggested Jews on campus were just trying \"to take full advantage of this moment. Huge fundraising potential.\" And Cristen Kromm, formerly the dean of undergraduate student life, texted vomiting emojis and wrote, \"Amazing what $$$$ can do.\"\n\nNone of the three responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe deans were removed from their positions last month but still kept on staff. At the time, President Nemat Shafik denounced the deans for \"conveying a lack of seriousness about the concerns of and the experiences of our Jewish community that is antithetical to our University's values.\"\n\nColumbia senior Eden Yadegar called the news \"long overdue.\"\n\nThe texts were \"a punch in the gut\" she says, and especially offensive that they were coming from the very deans \"tasked with ensuring that students are included and can succeed on campus.\" She says she has brought formal complaints to the deans' office before only to be disappointed by their response -- or lack thereof, and is now party to a lawsuit accusing Columbia of discriminatory behavior against Jewish students.\n\nYadegar also called it disappointing to not hear \"a proper apology from the deans themselves.\" She adds, Columbia has far more to do to address what she calls a culture of antisemitism: \"How did Columbia allow us to get to the point where it is so mainstream? And what are they doing about it?\"\n\nEarlier today, pro-Palestinian protestors vandalized the Brooklyn apartment building where Columbia's chief operating officer lives. They splattered red paint on the building, released insects into the lobby and put up leaflets and doctored photos showing the official with devil's ears.\n\nThe school has been under fire since the Israel-Hamas war prompted volatile pro-Palestinian protests and some Jewish students complained of an increasingly hostile environment.

He said \"the loss of trust and the pain this incident has caused, particularly to the Jewish members of our community, must be fully repaired.\"\n\nThe text exchange took place during the Columbia's reunion weekend in May at an event called \"Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present and Future.\" The event was held a month after pro-Palestinian protesters were cleared out of Columbia's Hamilton Hall and an on-campus encampment had to be cleared by the NYPD.\n\nImages of the text exchange were initially published by conservative news outlet the Washington Free Beacon, and their content was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dean (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitic_trope", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitic trope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemat_Shafik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nemat Shafik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_symbolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi symbolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Education_and_the_Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/09/12/8a4ec9d2-9fd4-4c35-85e8-bdaefc1250ba/thumbnail/1200x630/6742977fcc76582ae1d3b4695d5a5e3c/gettyimages-1404549460.jpg?v=0a0c17d349635d55704afd4e16e28fc6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802862", "eventUri": "eng-9802862", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

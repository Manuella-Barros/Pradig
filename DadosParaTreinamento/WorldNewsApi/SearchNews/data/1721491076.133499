I have a hard time sleeping without feeling support around me. I toss and turn over 40 times per night according to my sleep app. I tried this hoping for the best and I will say, I slept like a baby for the first time in sevenyears. I put a pillow under each side to prop it up to make it cradle in more and I\u2019m in heaven. I'm 57 and have had a hard time dealing with the emptiness of divorce. Who needs a man when you\u2019ve got this to sleep in? Purchase it! You won\u2019t regret it. And best of all, no one snoring next to me! Win, win!\" \u2014Heavenstinyangels Another promising review: \"Soooo comfortable. Big enough for my daughter, and our dog, and me. Arrived in an appropriate time frame as advertised. The blanket that came with the bed was also a pleasant surprise. The bed and blanket are soft and cuddly. Sure to be the 'fought over' spot in our house for the foreseeable future.\" \u2014J Derks Get it from Amazon for $101.99+ (available in four colors).", "summary": "<h1>Hey Siri, play \"Hobbit Life\" by Regan Hicks.

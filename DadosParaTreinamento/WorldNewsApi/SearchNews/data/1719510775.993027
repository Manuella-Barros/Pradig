In a joint statement released on Saturday, the pair, both aged 64 and known for their work together on ITV's This Morning, said: \"[They] have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.\" The duo first crossed paths in 1997, tied the knot in 2010, and share a son, Jack Holmes, who is 22. Eamonn also has three older children from his previous marriage.

Although they haven't featured on each other's Instagram grids for some time, it's reported that they occasionally posted about one another in their Instagram Stories. Despite the split rumours, they were seen celebrating their son Jack's 21st birthday together last year. In February of the previous year, Ruth shared a heartfelt video showcasing a festively decorated table, reminiscing: \"A wonderful weekend spent celebrating our son Jack's 21st birthday ... where did those years go? ! ! ! Had to do my birthday table of course ... it's family tradition.\", reports the Irish Mirror. Eamonn Holmes was notably absent from the video that showcased a beautifully decorated table, but he did make an appearance in a snapshot with Ruth and their son Jack, which is believed to have been uploaded by Ruth on her Instagram Story at the time. The image, thought to be the latest of the ex-couple on social media, captured Jack sandwiched between his parents against a backdrop of balloons. A caption, presumably penned by Ruth, expressed disbelief at the passage of time: \"21 already... how did that happen? ! ! Happy birthday Jack. Love you son.\" Meanwhile, the last post featuring the pair together on Ruth's own Instagram dates back to July 2022, promoting her Feeling Fabulous event. The shared content included a humorous video with Eamonn and Ruth engaging in a playful exchange about the upcoming event. In the skit, Ruth is seen ticking off items for the event when Eamonn interjects, \"Sure you're not forgetting like something? [...] Someone maybe? Like, me? \" To which Ruth playfully responds, \"You want to come? \". Eamonn queries, \"Am I not invited? \" prompting Ruth to jest in the clip, \"Well, I hadn't really thought about it. Do people want to see you there? \" Eamonn retorts, \"I think they'll want to see me more than they'll wanna see that Anton [Du Beke] or that Rylan [Clark].\" Ruth concedes with a laugh, \"Oh, I don't know. Oh alright then, you can come.\" before she goes on to share details about the event tickets. The post caption read: \"Can't help but think I've forgotten something important for my Feeling Fabulous event! ? ... [Eamonn] of course! To celebrate Eamonn joining the amazing line up of guests we're giving you the chance to win a free ticket. [...] In his words... 'This event just got a whole lot more FABULOUS! '\". She had shared a photograph of them together the previous month on their anniversary, accompanied with a touching caption: \"Happy anniversary my love [Eamonn]. Loved you then. Love you still.\" Ruth affectionately added, \"Always have. Always will.\" Whilst it is believed that this promotional post was their last joint one before they announced their separation, Ruth has since mentioned Eamonn. She posted a joint picture with friend Rylan last year in January, where he can be seen using a stair lift at their residence. Though Eamonn wasn't in the snapshot, his voice could be heard in the background and Ruth tagged him. Meanwhile, it is said that Eamonn, who recently shared an old photo of him and Ruth from 2018 on his Instagram Story, hasn't uploaded a picture featuring both of them on his main Instagram feed for over a year.

Premier League clubs push for changes in VAR operation, including reducing delays, maintaining accuracy, and enhancing fan experience. Wolves, the only club in favour of removing VAR, now feel as though PGMOL will implement a higher threshold for VAR intervention.\n\nThe vote to remove VAR from the Premier League has failed at a ratio of 19 to 1. Wolves, who put forward the initial proposal, were the only club to vote in favour of the notion.\n\nIt has, however, been viewed as a positive process. Indeed, there is a feeling that it has provoked a very healthy debate. The meeting took around one hour with Premier League clubs pushing hard for VAR improvements to be made in an open and positive dialogue.\n\nNotably, both PGMOL head Howard Webb and Chief Football Officer at the Premier League Tony Scholes came under pressure from clubs. There is a desire for quick and meaningful improvements to be made, even if the overwhelming desire is for the technology to remain.\n\nIn a statement following the vote, the Premier League noted:\n\n\"While VAR produces more accurate decision-making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters.\"\n\nDiscussions Understood to Have Focused on Six Key Areas: Maintaining a high threshold for VAR intervention to deliver greater consistency and less interruptions to the flow of the game. Reducing delays to the game, primarily through the introduction of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) and the maintained high threshold for VAR intervention. Improving fan experience through a reduction in the delays, in-stadium announcements from referees after a post-VAR change of decision and where possible, an enhanced offering of big screen replays to include all VAR interventions. Working with PGMOL on the implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy. Increasing transparency and communication around VAR - including expanded communications from Premier League Match Centre and through broadcast programming such as Match Officials Mic'd Up. The delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign, which will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters. Related Premier League Table in 2023/24 Without VAR Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United would all be on fewer points this season if VAR was not in use. Wolves Reaction Believe PGMOL will now raise threshold of VAR intervention\n\nAlthough not coming as a surprise, Wolves are understood to have been left disappointed with the verdict but of the opinion that the hour-long talk has ultimately been positive. Despite not being successful with their plans to see VAR leave top-flight English football, there is a feeling that the PGMOL will now increase the threshold of VAR intervention.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Wolves would have picked up two more points, finishing one place higher, had every VAR error been erased in 2023/24.\n\nThey also released a statement noting: \"While we are disappointed with the outcome of the vote on the future of VAR at today's Annual General Meeting, we acknowledge and accept the decision made by our fellow clubs and we are reassured that the Premier League is taking the concerns of clubs and supporters seriously.\n\n\"We welcome the commitment to improve VAR, particularly in areas that address delays, consistency, and fan experience.

We cannot carry on like this.\"\n\nThe Premier League acknowledged VAR improvements were required.\n\n\"While VAR produces more accurate decision making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters,\" the league said in a statement.\n\nSemi-automated offside technology is set to be introduced next season in the hope this will reduce the length of time needed for offside checks.\n\nThe average reduction in waiting for the VAR decision will be 31 seconds, according to reports.\n\nIn-stadium announcements will be made where an on-field decision is changed following a VAR intervention to keep fans informed.\n\nThe Premier League said the \"high threshold\" for intervention would also be maintained and added it hoped to offer big screen replays of all VAR interventions where possible.\n\nLeague chiefs also said they would work with English football's referees' body, Professional Game Match Officials Limited, on \"more robust\" training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed in decision-making while preserving accuracy.\n\nThe Premier League also promised it would continue to lobby the International Football Association Board (IFAB), the sport's global rule-making body, to allow live video and audio broadcasts during VAR reviews.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/db4d81b8-240a-11ef-86c0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/e612251988de2d5e1317a6cd3bcde600ab83fcba.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

The Midlands side claimed that VAR was damaging the relationship between fans and the sport, while the technology was \"at odds with the spirit of the game\".\n\nThat vote will now come to a head later this week at a shareholders' meeting. All 17 clubs who were in the Premier League will attend, as well as the three promoted clubs Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton.\n\nThe meeting will take place on Thursday, June 6, in Harrogate. Wolves need 14 clubs to vote in favour of scrapping the technology. But according to The Telegraph, that is unlikely to happen.\n\nIt is suggested that clubs in the league - including Liverpool, Manchester United and West Ham - believe that the technology should remain in action, but with alterations. The Premier League have already introduced tweaks ahead of the 2024/25 season.\n\nClubs are due to be given briefs into the automatic offside technology set to be used. It is hoped that the technology will cut wait times caused by offside decisions by an average of 31 seconds.\n\nHoward Webb, the head of English referees, is also set to make further changes to VAR. That includes making on-field announcements when any check is being made - audio that will be broadcast within stadiums.\n\nAhead of Thursday's vote, the Premier League said: \"The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the annual general meeting next month. Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.\n\nShould VAR be scrapped? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\n\"However, the league fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL [Professional Game Match Officials Limited], to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans.\"\n\nVAR has been used in the Premier League since the 2019/20 season. Clubs had voted unanimously to introduce the technology back in November 2018.\n\nCalling on clubs to reverse that vote, Wolves said: \"The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart.\n\n\"However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand. The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League, PGMOL and our fellow competitors.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

It was thought the vote might not even go ahead due to a lack of support, and although it did, it was essentially a token measure, having been effectively reduced to an umbrella discussion of areas for improvement\n\nAhead of the annual general meeting, clubs who regularly play in European competition, which features VAR, had not been expected to entertain removing it from the Premier League, and clubs from lower down in the table had indicated that ditching the video referee at this stage would be counter-productive.\n\nWhile other clubs shared Wolves' concern about ongoing problems with the implementation of VAR, many believe that it provides a safety net against poor on-field decisions and that steps should be taken to improve the processes.\n\nClubs agreed on six action points for the improvement of VAR:\n\n1. Maintaining a high threshold for VAR intervention to deliver greater consistency and fewer interruptions to the flow of the game.\n\n2. Reducing delays to the game, primarily through the introduction of semiautomated offside technology (SAOT) and the maintained high threshold for VAR intervention.\n\n3.

Increasing transparency and communication around VAR -- including expanded communications from Premier League Match Centre and through broadcast programming\n\n6. The delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign that will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters.\n\nShortly after the Premier League revealed Wolves' motion had been defeated, the club released a statement.\n\n\"While we are disappointed with the outcome of the vote on the future of VAR at today's Annual General Meeting, we acknowledge and accept the decision made by our fellow clubs and we are reassured that the Premier League is taking the concerns of clubs and supporters seriously,\" the statement read.\n\n\"We welcome the commitment to improve VAR, particularly in areas that address delays, consistency, and fan experience. While we still believe that Premier League football would be superior for supporters, players, coaches and viewers without VAR, we think that these improvements are crucial for the integrity of the game and for enhancing the overall matchday experience for our supporters.\n\n\"Wolves remain committed to working closely with the Premier League and PGMOL to ensure that VAR continues to evolve and better serve the interests of football. We appreciate the efforts being made to address the issues that we have highlighted in our resolution and look forward to seeing whether the changes implemented this summer can reverse the decline in matchday experience for our fans, and respect for our officials.\"\n\nWith 38 VAR errors in 2022-23, the Premier League highlighted a 21% drop in mistakes year-on-year to show things are getting better despite some high-profile incidents. Yet the problem is there are many more situations outside of those identified by the KMI Panel that managers and fans will feel are wrong.\n\nClubs approved referees announcing the explanation for a VAR overturn to the crowd. This will largely apply only to a referee visiting the pitchside monitor to overturn a subjective decision, which happened 66 times last season. It will not apply to the occasions when a VAR checks and opts not to send the referee to the screen, so for instance three penalty incidents that incensed Nottingham Forest in their 2-0 loss at Everton in April. This cannot include any use of the VAR audio.\n\nIt's hoped that this will remove some of the inertia inside a stadium about why a decision has been changed, but it is unlikely to go far enough to placate fans who feel VAR has taken far more away from the game than it has added.\n\nThe AGM comes less than two months after the 20 Premier League clubs voted to introduce SAOT next season, which involves a contract with a new offside technology supplier, Second Spectrum. That will be delayed until after one of the autumn international breaks as further testing is required to ensure the system is robust.\n\nIt is hoped that SAOT will, on average, make offside decisions 31 seconds quicker by removing the human aspect of the VAR drawing lines onto the players. But this technology isn't going to make offside calls instant; there is likely to be an increased number of marginal decisions as, unlike the current Hawk-Eye software, SAOT doesn't have a built-in tolerance level, and in some situations -- where several players are involved in close proximity -- the VAR might have to resort to using the old Hawk-Eye system.\n\nSecond Spectrum has been the official tracking provider of the Premier League since 2020 and will use AI-powered skeletal tracking technology -- which provides the foundation for SAOT. However, as in Serie A and the UEFA Champions League, there won't be a chip within the ball to automatically detect the kick-point. So far this has been used only at the FIFA World Cup, but it will be used by UEFA for the first time at Euro 2024.\n\nThe Premier League is, to an extent, constrained by the International Football Association Board, the sport's lawmaker, as to what can be shared during a game, such as the conversation between the referee and VAR as it happens. The Premier League said it would \"continue to lobby IFAB to allow greater flexibility in the Laws of the Game to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dale_johnson@espn.com.sg", "name": "Dale Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk-Eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawk-Eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1127%2Fr1258583_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

This is an improvement on 2022-23, when the league says there were 11 wrong VAR decisions to 105 which were right.\n\nAmong the other reasons cited to keep VAR is that the Premier League is \"contractually committed to significant operating cost elements of VAR for the next three years\".\n\nAs the Premier League would be the only major European league to remove VAR if the vote passes, the league warns that it would be \"potentially damaging\" to its reputation, while English referees would not get major assignments for Uefa or Fifa tournaments \"as regular experience operating both on-field with VAR and acting as VAR domestically are critical\".\n\nIn the same briefing document, the Premier League accepts there are issues with VAR which it is attempting to sort, including the amount of time it takes for decisions to be made.\n\nThe document says the average delay to a game for a single VAR check lasted 64 seconds in the 2023\u201124 season, up from 40 seconds in 2022-23.\n\nOne expected change is the use of in-game VAR announcements from referees, which Fifa introduced at a number of its competitions last year, including the 2023 Women's World Cup.\n\nThese changes are likely to be welcomed by most Premier League clubs. BBC Sport understands Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham are among clubs who want to keep VAR, but are demanding that improvements are made.\n\nLiverpool are also not supporting moves to get rid of VAR.\n\nBut Wolves remain staunchly in favour of scrapping VAR and sent out a briefing paper of their own on Wednesday.\n\nThe club highlight as issues the negative impact on match-going fans and their experience at games, as well as what they claim is a more negligible impact on correct decisions.\n\n\"Wolves argue that the use of VAR has led to increased disengagement among the Premier League's match-attending fans due to its adverse effects on the match experience, resulting in apathy, hostility and erosion of trust in football's authorities and officials,\" they said in the paper.\n\nThey added: \"Premier League data shows an increase in correct decisions from 82% pre-VAR to 96% with VAR, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing errors.\n\n\"If we put aside the argument on whether the data is credible and convincing, while overall accuracy might be increased to a debatable degree, the cost in terms of match enjoyment and fan engagement outweighs these benefits.\n\n\"The integrity of the game is compromised by lengthy interruptions and inconsistent application of VAR protocols.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/h6SZlkWI7tUKUz0W7QZMbA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/579aa15d87f3380bb6e174add3672610", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 264}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

The vote saw a decisive outcome with clubs voting 19-1 in favor of keeping VAR. For the motion to pass, it would have required 14 out of 20 clubs to vote in favor, but it was soundly defeated, demonstrating strong support for maintaining VAR.\n\nIn an official statement, the Premier League said: \"Premier League clubs today voted in favor of continuing to operate VAR in the Premier League. While VAR produces more accurate decision-making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters. As part of thorough discussions at the Annual General Meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL, the Premier League, and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation.\"\n\nAreas for improvement in VAR\n\nThe Premier League highlighted six key areas where they plan to make improvements based on discussions with the clubs:\n\nHigh Threshold for VAR Intervention: Maintain a high threshold for VAR intervention to ensure greater consistency and fewer interruptions to the game's flow.\n\nReducing Delays: Focus on minimizing game delays by introducing semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) and upholding a high threshold for VAR interventions.\n\nEnhancing Fan Experience: Improve the experience for fans by reducing delays, making in-stadium announcements from referees after VAR decisions, and enhancing big screen replays to include all VAR interventions.\n\nRobust VAR Training: Work with PGMOL to implement more robust VAR training to improve consistency and emphasize speed while maintaining accuracy.\n\nTransparency and Communication: Increase transparency and communication around VAR, including more detailed communications from the Premier League Match Centre and through broadcast programming such as \"Match Officials Mic'd Up.\"\n\nFan Communication Campaign: Launch a communication campaign to clarify VAR's role in the game for participants and supporters, enhancing understanding and acceptance of the technology.\n\nThe decision to retain VAR, despite its controversies, underscores the Premier League's commitment to accurate decision-making in football. However, the call for improvements indicates an understanding that the technology must evolve to better serve the game and its stakeholders.\n\nWhat's next for the Premier League\n\nSignificant changes are expected in the Premier League next season, particularly with the introduction of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT). This technology, which has already been used in the Champions League and World Cup, promises to make offside decisions quicker and more accurate, thus reducing delays and controversies.\n\nAdditionally, the Premier League's efforts to improve the fan experience and increase transparency around VAR decisions are crucial steps towards rebuilding trust and ensuring that the technology enhances, rather than detracts from, the excitement of the game.\n\nWhile the decision to retain VAR reflects its importance in modern football, the Premier League's commitment to improving its implementation is a positive step forward. By addressing the identified areas for improvement, the Premier League aims to create a smoother, more enjoyable experience for players, coaches, and fans alike. As these changes take effect, the hope is that VAR will become a more seamlessly integrated part of the beautiful game, contributing to its fairness and excitement.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Premier-League-makes-final-decision-on-VAR-for-next-season.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

The Midlands team argued that VAR was harming the relationship between fans and football, and that the technology was \"at odds with the spirit of the game\".\n\nThis vote will reach its climax later this week at a shareholders' meeting. All 17 clubs who were in the Premier League will be present, along with the three clubs promoted from the Championship, Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton.\n\nREAD MORE: \"I have to think\": Kevin De Bruyne casts doubt on Man City future\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United learn Joao Neves asking price as \u00a351m offer rejected for Casemiro replacement\n\nThe meeting is scheduled for Thursday, June 6, in Harrogate. Wolves require 14 clubs to vote in favour of abolishing the technology. However, according to The Telegraph, this is unlikely to occur.\n\nIt's suggested that league clubs - including United, Liverpool, and West Ham - believe that the technology should continue to be used, albeit with modifications. The Premier League has already implemented tweaks ahead of the 2024/25 season.\n\nClubs are set to receive briefings on the automatic offside technology that is due to be utilised. It is hoped that this technology will reduce the delay caused by offside decisions by an average of 31 seconds.\n\nHoward Webb, the head of English referees, is also expected to introduce further changes to VAR. This includes making on-field announcements when any check is being made - audio that will be broadcast within stadiums.\n\nIn anticipation of Thursday's vote, the Premier League stated: \"The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the annual general meeting next month. Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.\n\n\"However, the league fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL [Professional Game Match Officials Limited], to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans.\"\n\nVAR has been a part of the Premier League since the 2019/20 season, after clubs unanimously voted to introduce the technology in November 2018. Wolves, urging clubs to reconsider that vote, said: \"The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart.\n\n\"However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand. The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League, PGMOL and our fellow competitors.\"\n\nWhile United's stance has been outlined, it is more unclear how City may vote.

As part of ongoing work to improve VAR, six key areas were focussed on as part of discussions with clubs:\n\nMaintaining a high threshold for VAR intervention to deliver greater consistency and less interruptions to the flow of the game. Reducing delays to the game, primarily through the introduction of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) and the maintained high threshold for VAR intervention. Improving fan experience through a reduction in the delays, in-stadium announcements from referees after a post-VAR change of decision and where possible, an enhanced offering of big screen replays to include all VAR interventions. Working with PGMOL on the implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy. Increasing transparency and communication around VAR - including expanded communications from Premier League Match Centre and through broadcast programming such as Match Officials Mic'd Up. The delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign, which will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters.\n\n\"It was confirmed in April that Semi-Automated Offside Technology will be introduced in the autumn of 2024.

The league also promised \"expanded communications\" on VAR from its match centre and through continuing with programmes like Match Officials Mic'd Up.\n\nThe league said it will also continue to lobby the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which sets the laws of the game, to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\n\nWolves said in a statement: \"While we are disappointed with the outcome of the vote on the future of VAR at today's Annual General Meeting, we acknowledge and accept the decision made by our fellow clubs and we are reassured that the Premier League is taking the concerns of clubs and supporters seriously.\n\n\"We welcome the commitment to improve VAR, particularly in areas that address delays, consistency, and fan experience. While we still believe that Premier League football would be superior for supporters, players, coaches and viewers without VAR, we think that these improvements are crucial for the integrity of the game and for enhancing the overall matchday experience for our supporters.\n\n\"Wolves remain committed to working closely with the Premier League and PGMOL to ensure that VAR continues to evolve and better serve the interests of football. We appreciate the efforts being made to address the issues that we have highlighted in our resolution and look forward to seeing whether the changes implemented this summer can reverse the decline in matchday experience for our fans, and respect for our officials.\"\n\nLiverpool and Manchester United were among the clubs who were understood prior to Thursday's vote to be supporters of keeping and improving VAR. A survey of 16,000 United fans conducted by their supporters' trust found more than 50 per cent supported scrapping it regardless of any improvements that could be made.\n\nMalcolm Clarke, the chairman of the Football Supporters' Association (FSA), said: \"Support for VAR has collapsed since its introduction into English football - it's clear that in its current form it has made the match a less enjoyable experience. So much so that more than two-thirds of supporters now say they are against it.\n\n\"There's a growing feeling from fans that the increase in decision-making accuracy is not a price worth paying for the huge impact VAR has had on the match-going experience.\n\n\"Enormous changes to the current system are required to improve things, particularly for supporters in stadiums. We cannot carry on like this.\"\n\nAn FSA poll conducted last summer found only one in 20 who had experienced VAR in a stadium rated their experience of it as good or very good.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 6 Jun 2024, 3:20 PM Last updated: Thu 6 Jun 2024, 3:48 PM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connaught Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrogate", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrogate"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrogate"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Supporters'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football Supporters' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporters'_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supporters' trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=643fdcf9-fa03-5c74-a688-88d749876486&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99852&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

A Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) poll of more than 16,000 Red Devils fans found less than one per cent were in favour of keeping VAR in its current form.\n\nMore than half - 50.6 per cent - were not even prepared to countenance any attempt to keep VAR even if it could be improved.\n\nOne of the major criticisms of VAR is the time taken to reach a decision.\n\nPremier League clubs have already given unanimous support to the introduction of semi-automated offside technology in the autumn, which top-flight sources say will reduce the length of time of the average check by 31 seconds.\n\nWhile there is a perception that some decisions take a long time, delays because of VAR were, on average, just over a minute per game in the Premier League in the 2023-24 season, roughly the same time as a goal celebration.\n\nThe Premier League intervention rate is understood to be lower than that seen in UEFA and FIFA competitions, while 107 correct outcomes were recorded due to VAR last season according to the league's independent key match incidents (KMI) panel.\n\nThe KMI panel identified 25 missed interventions - where it felt a video assistant should have stepped in but did not - which arguably indicates the high bar that has been set for intervention.\n\nThere were also six instances of incorrect decisions following a VAR review - five where referees were incorrectly advised to go to the screen and change their on-field decision, and one where an official should have changed their decision at the screen but stuck with the on-field decision incorrectly.\n\nThe Premier League could introduce in-stadium announcements after VAR reviews in time for next season, a system seen at last year's Women's World Cup.\n\nThe Football Supporters' Association's survey last summer found only one in 20 who had experienced VAR in a stadium rated their experience of it as good or very good.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 5 Jun 2024, 4:06 PM Last updated: Wed 5 Jun 2024, 4:29 PM", "source": {"uri": "meathchronicle.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meath Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrogate", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrogate"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrogate"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_Supporters'_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United Supporters' Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Supporters'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football Supporters' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_celebration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal celebration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=2ace314d-3371-5f06-ab58-d232a0dc2eb8&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99265&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

The Midlands outfit argued that VAR was straining the bond between fans and the sport, and that the technology was \"at odds with the spirit of the game\".\n\nThis vote will reach its climax later this week at a shareholders' meeting. All 17 clubs who were in the Premier League will be present, along with the three promoted clubs Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton.\n\nThe meeting is scheduled for Thursday, June 6, in Harrogate. Wolves require 14 clubs to vote in favour of ditching the technology. However, according to The Telegraph, this seems unlikely.\n\nIt's suggested that league clubs - including Liverpool, Manchester United and West Ham - believe that the technology should stay in play, but with modifications. The Premier League have already implemented tweaks ahead of the 2024/25 season.\n\nClubs are expected to receive briefs on the automatic offside technology set to be utilised. It's hoped that this technology will reduce wait times caused by offside decisions by an average of 31 seconds.\n\nREAD MORE: When does the Fantasy Premier League 2024/25 season launch? expected FPL start date and key dates\n\nREAD MORE: Champions League pitch invaders arrests made as Wembley Stadium releases statement\n\nHoward Webb, the chief of English referees, is also poised to make additional changes to VAR. This includes making on-field announcements when any check is being conducted - audio that will be broadcast within stadiums.\n\nAhead of Thursday's vote, the Premier League stated: \"The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the annual general meeting next month. Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.\n\n\"However, the league fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL [Professional Game Match Officials Limited], to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans.\"\n\nVAR has been a part of the Premier League since the 2019/20 season, after clubs unanimously voted to introduce the technology in November 2018.Wolves, however, have called on clubs to reconsider that vote, stating: \"The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart.\n\n\"\"However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand. The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League, PGMOL and our fellow competitors.\".\n\nBack in November, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta spoke out about how VAR was implemented following the decision to allow Anthony Gordon's winning goal for Newcastle. Last season new Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca spoke of how he wanted VAR in the Championship.\n\nTottenham boss Ange Postecoglou has however called for the technology to be scrapped. Speaking back in November, he said: \"With VAR, the more we use it the worse it's going to get. Clear and obvious error? It seems like everything is getting scrutinised.\n\n\"It's not our game. We're not rugby - we don't have those stoppages. What I always loved about our game - especially in England - was the frenetic pace. Why are we trying to take that out? None of us liked it when they were taking too long over a decision and last week it sounded like they were rushing it.

The Black Country club said VAR had led to \"numerous unintended consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football\" and that the system was \"undermining the Premier League brand\".\n\nWolves were adamant even as recently as Wednesday they would not be dissuaded from taking the issue to a vote, even if that meant a heavy defeat. Wolves would have required the support of 13 other clubs for their motion to abolish to have been carried.\n\nUltimately Wolves were the only club who supported getting rid of VAR.\n\nSteps have been taken which the Premier League, referees' body Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) and top-flight clubs hope will improve the experience of VAR in 2024-25.\n\nSemi-automated offside technology will be introduced in the autumn, with top-flight sources saying it will reduce the length of time of the average check by 31 seconds.\n\nIn-stadium announcements will be made - like those seen at last year's Women's World Cup - when an on-field decision is changed following a VAR intervention.\n\nReplays of incidents where VAR intervened will be shown, where possible, on stadium big screens while the \"high threshold\" for intervention will be maintained.\n\nThe Premier League was understood to have had a lower intervention rate last season compared to UEFA and FIFA competitions.\n\nWolves issued a statement soon after the Premier League confirmed VAR would continue. They welcomed the commitments to improve VAR but said: \"We still believe that Premier League football would be superior for supporters, players, coaches and viewers without VAR.\"\n\nThe chair of the Football Supporters' Association, Malcolm Clarke, said on Thursday: \"Support for VAR has collapsed since its introduction into English football - it's clear that in its current form it has made the match a less enjoyable experience. So much so that more than two-thirds of supporters now say they are against it.\n\n\"There's a growing feeling from fans that the increase in decision-making accuracy is not a price worth paying for the huge impact VAR has had on the matchgoing experience.\n\n\"Enormous changes to the current system are required to improve things, particularly for supporters in stadiums.

Out of 20 teams, 19 supported VAR, with Wolves being the only dissenting vote. The league aims to improve VAR's accuracy, reduce game delays, and enhance fan experience through new initiatives like semi-automated offside technology.\n\nPremier League teams voted in favour of keeping Video Assistant Referees (VAR) on Thursday, despite the considerable amount of criticism this past season about the technology-aided officiating system. The BBC reported that 19 of the 20 teams voted in favour of keeping VAR, which was first introduced in the 2019-20 season, with Wolverhampton Wanderers allegedly casting the lone vote against.\n\n\"While VAR produces more accurate decision making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters,\" the league said in a statement. Six key areas were identified during discussions with clubs:\n\n- Maintaining a high threshold for VAR; - Reducing delays to the game, primarily through the introduction of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT);\n\n- Improving fan experience through a reduction in delays and in-stadium announcements from referees to explain post-VAR decision changes; - More robust VAR training to improve consistency, with an emphasis on speed while preserving accuracy;\n\n- More transparency and communication around VAR; - A fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign to better clarify the technology's role in the game.\n\nThe league confirmed in April that SAOT will be introduced in the autumn of 2024 to provide quicker and consistent placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player tracking. Wolves said they were disappointed in the vote's outcome in a statement to the BBC.\n\n\"(But) we acknowledge and accept the decision made by our fellow clubs and we are reassured that the Premier League is taking the concerns of clubs and supporters seriously,\" Wolves said. \"We welcome the commitment to improve VAR... While we still believe the Premier League football would be superior for supporters, players, coaches and viewers without VAR, we think that these improvements are crucial for the integrity of the game and for enhancing the overall matchday experience for our supporters.\"\n\nThe league and the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd.

Teams in the English top flight took a vote on Thursday on whether or not to scrap the technology. It was previously revealed that Wolves was leading a charge to potentially bar VAR beginning at the start of the 2024/25 season. Nevertheless, the West Midlands side was the only Premier League club to vote in favor of banning the technology.\n\nNearly every Premier League coach complained about officiating in England at some point during the most recent season. Wolves manager Gary O'Neil, however, was perhaps the most vocal of his peers regarding VAR. The coach regularly raised concerns over decisions that affected his team. O'Neil was eventually charged in April after labeling a specific call as \"scandalous\" and \"horrendous.\"\n\nWolves wanted to ban VAR because various refereeing decisions went against the club since the technology's introduction. ESPN's Dale Johnson recently determined that Wolves were negatively affected by VAR more than any other Premier League side. The expert on the technology claimed that Wolves had a \"VAR net score\" of -17 over the last five seasons. Arsenal, the club with the second-worst VAR rating, had a -7 VAR net score.\n\nJust before the official vote by the Premier League teams, English officials sent documents to all 20 clubs regarding the effectiveness of the technology. The league claimed there would be 100 more incorrect refereeing decisions each year if VAR did not exist. A vast majority of the top-flight teams agreed with the notion.\n\nFollowing the overwhelming vote to keep VAR in place, the Premier League agreed to make several changes to the technology. One of the biggest tweaks regarding VAR will be to improve the fan experience by minimizing delays. Introducing semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) later in the year can help this. SAOT quickly tracks players on the pitch to determine whether or not they have strayed offside.\n\nEnglish officials recently admitted to their clubs that VAR delays increased by more than 50% last season. Making correct calls is ultimately the most important aspect of officiating. Nevertheless, many fans grew increasingly frustrated over the numerous lengthy delays during matches.\n\nAlong with implementing the popular new technology, Premier League referees will make in-stadium announcements after VAR calls. The move will give fans in the actual arena a better understanding of each decision. Analysts explain VAR decisions clearly and concisely on TV. Fans at the games do not have ample access to replays.\n\nDecreasing delays will make the VAR experience better for fans. However, there are still concerns over the level of officiating in England. While the Premier League is the most popular soccer league in the world, refereeing in the division is overwhelmingly unpopular.

Another top flight club has said the VAR system at the moment \"isn't working\" and there \"clearly are issues\".\n\nWolves, when they tabled the motion, explained their motives in a statement. It read: \"There is no blame to be placed - we are all just looking for the best possible outcome for football - and all stakeholders have been working hard to try and make the introduction of additional technology a success.\n\n\"However, after five seasons of VAR in the Premier League, it is time for a constructive and critical debate on its future. Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards.\"\n\nOne change that is set to be introduced from next season in thde use of in-game VAR announcements from referees. FIFA introduced the trials at a number of its competitions last year and confirmed this would be extended after positive feedback.\n\nThe match referee will only be confirming decisions, rather than the process of how they arrived at that decision. No discussions involving the VAR will be heard, but the Premier League view the concept as a step forward.\n\nHoward Webb, who heads up the PGMOL, has been a strong defender of VAR and stated earlier this season that it \"would be foolish to take away a tool that can remove clear errors from the game - almost 40 this season. Usually we have seen around 100 situations rectified through the use of VAR. Why would you want to take that away and leave those errors in the game?\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

It was thought the vote might not even go ahead due to a lack of support, and while it did it was effectively a token measure; it was effectively reduced to an umbrella discussion of areas for improvement\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\nAhead of the meeting, clubs who regularly play in European competition, which feature VAR, had not been expected to entertain removing it from the Premier League, while clubs from lower down in the table had indicated that ditching the video referee at this stage would be counter-productive.\n\nWhile other clubs shared Wolves' concern about ongoing problems with its implementation, many believe VAR provides a safety net against poor on-field decisions and steps should be taken to improve the processes.\n\nClub agreed six action points for the improvement of VAR:\n\n1. Maintaining a high threshold for VAR intervention to deliver greater consistency and less interruptions to the flow of the game.\n\n2. Reducing delays to the game, primarily through the introduction of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) and the maintained high threshold for VAR intervention.\n\n3. Improving fan experience through a reduction in the delays, in-stadium announcements from referees after a post-VAR change of decision and where possible, an enhanced offering of big screen replays to include all VAR interventions.\n\n4. Working with PGMOL on the implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy.\n\n5. Increasing transparency and communication around VAR -- including expanded communications from Premier League Match Centre and through broadcast programming\n\n6. The delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign, which will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters.\n\nWith 38 VAR errors in 2022-23, the Premier League highlighted a 21% drop in mistakes year-on-year to show things are getting better, despite some high profile incidents. Yet the problem is there are many more situations outside of those identified by the KMI Panel which managers and fans will feel are wrong.\n\nClubs approved referees announcing the explanation for a VAR overturn to the crowd. This will largely only apply to a referee visiting the pitchside monitor to overturn a subjective decision, which happened 66 times last season. It will not apply to the occasions when a VAR checks and opts not to send the referee to the screen, so for instance three penalty incidents which incensed Nottingham Forest in their 2-0 loss at Everton in April. This cannot include any use of the VAR audio.\n\nIt's hoped that this will remove some of the inertia inside a stadium about why a decision has been changed, but it is unlikely to go far enough to placate fans who feel VAR has taken far more away from the game than it has added.\n\nThe AGM comes less than two months after the 20 Premier League clubs voted to introduce semiautomated offside technology (SAOT) next season, which involves a contract with a new offside technology supplier, Second Spectrum. That will be delayed until after one of the autumn international breaks as further testing is required to ensure the system is robust.\n\nIt is hoped that SAOT will, on average, make offside decisions 31 seconds quicker by removing the human aspect of the VAR drawing lines onto the players. But this technology isn't going to make offside calls instant, there is likely to be an increased number of marginal decisions as, unlikely the current Hawk-Eye software, SAOT doesn't have a built-in tolerance level, and some situations -- where several players are involved in close proximity -- the VAR may have to resort to using the old Hawk-Eye system.\n\nSecond Spectrum has been the official tracking provider of the Premier League since 2020, and will use artificial intelligence (AI)-powered skeletal tracking technology -- which provides the foundation for SAOT. However, as in Serie A and the UEFA Champions League there won't be a chip within the ball to automatically detect the kick-point. So far this has only been used at the FIFA World Cup, but it will be used by UEFA for the first time at Euro 2024.\n\nThe Premier League is, to an extent, constrained by the IFAB, football's lawmaker, as to what can be shared during a game, such as the conversation between the referee and VAR as it happens. Th Premier League said it would \"continue to lobby IFAB to allow greater flexibility in the Laws of the Game to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\"", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_replay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instant replay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk-Eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawk-Eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1127%2Fr1258583_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Wolves - who last month called the vote - were understood to be adamant they wanted a debate to take place, even though they anticipated a heavy defeat. The club welcomed the chance to discuss VAR's failings on Thursday, with many rival teams agreeing further tweaks are needed urgently.\n\n\"While VAR produces more accurate decision making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters,\" the Premier League said in a statement following the 19-1 vote. \"As part of thorough discussions at the Annual General Meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL, the Premier League and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation.\"\n\nThe five key areas to improve include:\n\nMaintaining a high threshold for VAR interventionReducing delays to the game through the introduction of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) Improving fan experience through a reduction in the delaysIn-stadium announcements from referees after a post-VAR change of decision and where possible, Enhanced offering of big screen replays to include all VAR interventions\n\nThe league will also work with PGMOL, the refereeing body, on the \"implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy\".\n\nThe other two improvements include \"increasing transparency and communication around VAR\" including via the Match Officials Mic'd Up show and \"the delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign, which will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters\".\n\nIt was confirmed in April that semi-automated offside technology will be introduced in the autumn of 2024. The Premier League and PGMOL say they will continue to lobby IFAB to allow greater flexibility in the Laws of the Game to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\n\nThe club vote took place in Yorkshire at a Premier League AGM just days before Manchester City's two-week private arbitration looms. The Telegraph disclosed earlier this week how the league was also set to advise clubs at the meeting to trial rather than vote on new squad cost controls and spending caps.\n\nRecommended\n\nJurgen Klopp: I would vote to scrap VAR Read more\n\nAfter first tabling their motion to ditch VAR in England last month, Wolves warned the top tier was at risk of being \"irrevocably damaged\" if clubs did not support their proposal. The club's chairman Jeff Shi wrote in a column for The Telegraph that VAR has introduced \"a level of interference that is at odds with the spirit of our game\".\n\nClubs were given a full brief on a deal that has been struck with American software company Second Spectrum, which uses artificial intelligence and a chip in the ball to identify when attackers are ahead of defenders. Offside decisions should be cut by an average of 31 seconds, which, the Premier League hopes, will significantly reduce frustrations in the stands and dugouts. The Second Spectrum system will automatically detect when attackers are offside when the ball is kicked and the VAR will then judge if the attacker is interfering with play or not.\n\nClubs believe the improvements will ease sceptical fanbases, although the latest survey Ipsos UK shows the public is increasingly split on VAR.

This is not expected to be reached, as there is a feeling that most clubs would be inclined to improve the current system rather than get rid of it entirely.\n\nThere are also set to be officiating changes in the Premier League next season, with the introduction of semi-automated offsides approved at April's Premier League shareholders' meeting.\n\nChief of the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOL), England's officiating body, Howard Webb also confirmed in April the Premier League was exploring the introduction of in-stadium announcements to explain VAR decisions.\n\nVAR has been used in the English top-flight since 2019, helping improve decision making but also generating persistent controversy.\n\nWhen putting the motion forward last month, Wolves accepted the decision to introduce VAR was \"made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart\" but argued it has caused \"numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand\".\n\nWolves listed a host of repercussions including the impact on goal celebrations, confusion inside stadiums due to lengthy checks and poor communication and diminished accountability of on-field officials.\n\nThe top flight's board of directors believes removing VAR is not the correct path forward, suggesting that doing so would increase wrong calls and adversely impact the Premier League's reputation among Europe's leading divisions. It also thinks the void left, having removed VAR, would potentially place even greater criticism on on-field decisions made by match officials and increase frustration for supporters.\n\nSince VAR was brought in five years ago, the number of correct decisions made in games has increased from 82 per cent, prior to its introduction, to 96 per cent this season. Statistics released by the English Football League (EFL) last month showed officials in the Championship, a division that has not implemented VAR, got 85 per cent of decisions right during the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nThe 2023-24 season has featured many contentious incidents in the Premier League, which has heightened the criticism of VAR and led some teams and fans to question the competition's integrity.\n\nLiverpool's Luis Diaz saw a goal wrongly disallowed for offside against Tottenham Hotspur in September, resulting in a PGMOL apology following a \"significant human error\".\n\nNottingham Forest have written letters of complaint to -- and considered suing -- PGMOL, while also questioning the appointment of VAR Stuart Attwell following April's defeat at Everton.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "omar_garrick@nytimes.com", "name": "Omar Garrick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_celebration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal celebration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Webb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Howard Webb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Attwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Attwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/05120413/GettyImages-2153209481-scaled-e1717603480787.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

How vote by EPL clubs affects replay next season", "body": "Video replay in global football has been in place since 2017 but has caused significant debate about its merits as fans, clubs, referees, and players continue to disagree about the effect of VAR on the game today.\n\nNo league has arguably had more controversy around VAR decisions and disruptions the past four years than the Premier League, as the English top flight continues to struggle with lengthy delays, incorrect decisions, and missed calls despite continued attempts to improve its implementation in the game.\n\nThat recently came to a head as one Premier League club proposed scrapping the system altogether at this summer's annual meeting, bringing the radical decision to vote among the league's 20 participants.\n\nThe Sporting News has the latest on which way the vote swung and how VAR will be implemented next season as the Premier League moves forward with its attempts to placate doubters and streamline the replay-review system's place in the game.\n\nMORE: How to fix VAR? Lessons from Sporting News exclusive tour of Bundesliga replay studio\n\nThe Premier League will continue its use of VAR for the 2024/25 season after a vote at the June 6 general assembly affirmed the league's use of replay in its current format.\n\nThe vote of the 20 clubs resulted in a 19-1 decision, with the lone dissenter being Wolves, the club that had proposed scrapping VAR in the first place.\n\nHowever, the vote did spark discussions on how to improve the system, and there will be consideration into ways for streamlining its disruption of the game and accuracy of decision-making for the coming season.\n\nAll proposals brought to vote at the annual Premier League general meeting must be pitched by a particular club to be voted on. The club that wanted to scrap VAR is Wolverhampton Wanderers, who were on the receiving end of a host of contentious VAR decisions across the 2023/24 Premier League season.\n\nThe club's statement indicated that while they do not believe any individual or body to be at fault for the replay system's perceived failures, they wished to discuss changes on the matter.\n\n\"There is no blame to be placed -- we are all just looking for the best possible outcome for football -- and all stakeholders have been working hard to try and make the introduction of additional technology a success.\"\n\nIn truth, the chances of scrapping VAR for the coming season were minute, and the purpose of proposing the vote was to spark the discussion required of all voting topics. Wolves simply wished to have a conversation on how to improve the system. Upon the results of the vote, the club released a statement on the matter.\n\n\"While we are disappointed with the outcome of the vote on the future of VAR at today's Annual General Meeting, we acknowledge and accept the decision made by our fellow clubs and we are reassured that the Premier League is taking the concerns of clubs and supporters seriously.\n\n\"We welcome the commitment to improve VAR, particularly in areas that address delays, consistency, and fan experience. While we still believe that Premier League football would be superior for supporters, players, coaches and viewers without VAR, we think that these improvements are crucial for the integrity of the game and for enhancing the overall matchday experience for our supporters.\"\n\nOne major improvement to VAR for the 2024/25 Premier League season will be the installment of semi-automated offside technology that will significantly improve the most regularly disruptive and controversial aspect of VAR as it stands.\n\nSemi-automated offside technology uses more than 20 cameras installed across the ground to triangulate the position of every player throughout the game and thus can make razor-thin offside decisions quickly to continue the match without much stoppage.\n\nNo longer will VAR officials be tasked with drawing lines on a screen to determine if a player is offside through a particular passage of play, as the VAR officials will be tasked only with setting the kick point of the ball before the semi-automated system takes over and makes the decision. This will greatly decrease stoppages for decision-making and will also make reception of decisions far more universal, replacing the old clunky system that struggled to convince fans of its accuracy.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Replay (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/nba-canada--1e0adfe2-02c3-4d0d-961a-ace0b4abd635.png?itok=BBo0HuBe", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1149, "textEnd": 1155}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Wolves - who last month called the vote - were understood to be adamant they wanted a debate to take place, even though they anticipated a heavy defeat. The club welcomed the chance to discuss VAR's failings on Thursday, with many rival teams agreeing further tweaks are needed urgently.\n\n\"While VAR produces more accurate decision making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters,\" the Premier League said in a statement following the 19-1 vote. \"As part of thorough discussions at the Annual General Meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL, the Premier League and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation.\"\n\nThe five key areas to improve include:\n\nThe league will also work with PGMOL, the refereeing body, on the \"implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy\".\n\nThe other two improvements include \"increasing transparency and communication around VAR\" including via the Match Officials Mic'd Up show and \"the delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign, which will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters\".\n\nIt was confirmed in April that semi-automated offside technology will be introduced in the autumn of 2024. The Premier League and PGMOL say they will continue to lobby IFAB to allow greater flexibility in the Laws of the Game to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\n\nThe club vote took place in Yorkshire at a Premier League AGM just days before Manchester City's two-week private arbitration looms. The Telegraph disclosed earlier this week how the league was also set to advise clubs at the meeting to trial rather than vote on new squad cost controls and spending caps.\n\nAfter first tabling their motion to ditch VAR in England last month, Wolves warned the top tier was at risk of being \"irrevocably damaged\" if clubs did not support their proposal. The club's chairman Jeff Shi wrote in a column for The Telegraph that VAR has introduced \"a level of interference that is at odds with the spirit of our game\".\n\nClubs were given a full brief on a deal that has been struck with American software company Second Spectrum, which uses artificial intelligence and a chip in the ball to identify when attackers are ahead of defenders. Offside decisions should be cut by an average of 31 seconds, which, the Premier League hopes, will significantly reduce frustrations in the stands and dugouts. The Second Spectrum system will automatically detect when attackers are offside when the ball is kicked and the VAR will then judge if the attacker is interfering with play or not.\n\nClubs believe the improvements will ease sceptical fanbases, although the latest survey Ipsos UK shows the public is increasingly split on VAR.

Turn another and you'd eavesdrop on a commentator asking for details of sending audio from the decision chamber to an AV truck. Enter the main meeting room and you would witness a forensic powerpoint presentation from officials being queried by journalists seeking the nitty gritty on just how slow a slow-mo replay is.\n\nCall it a charm offensive or a necessary education, this was the Premier League's attempt to explain how the brave new world of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) was going to change football for the better. This was the entrance of 'Stockley Park' into English football's vernacular.\n\nThere were questions, and lots of them, but the league body were determined to ensure that the media and the broadcasters were fully briefed on what types of incidents VAR could rule on and how the decision-making process would work.\n\nThey cautioned that there would be teething issues, but they knew the media set the narrative and, by proxy, any misconceptions would duly filter into fanbases and dictate the perception of VAR as a force for good or evil.\n\nFive seasons later, this careful cultivating of the message has left us with a situation where the Premier League is still trying to win over fans and is now facing a vote on VAR's very existence from their own member clubs, who had unanimously backed its introduction.\n\nLast month, Wolves made the bold move to call for the removal of VAR this summer. This week, all 20 clubs will be present at the Premier League's Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Harrogate to vote on the resolution.\n\nThe essence of their argument, outlined in last month's statement calling for change, was that \"the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game\".\n\nIt is thought unlikely that the vote will pass as any proposed rule change requires a two-thirds majority (14 out of 20), but its inclusion on the agenda means it will open up a wider conversation around VAR and give clubs an open platform to discuss the issues in detail and propose changes.\n\nDespite the challenge, the Premier League remain steadfastly committed to VAR. While accepting it is not perfect, the Premier League's chief football officer, Tony Scholes, last month pointed to the increase in accurate big decisions, from 82 per cent to 96 per cent, as proof of its value to the game.\n\nSeveral measures are being introduced next season that they believe will improve the product: semi-automated offside will be introduced and is expected to cut decision-making by over 30 seconds; there will also be in-stadium announcements to explain the VAR decision; and the 'clear and obvious' threshold before intervention will be strengthened.\n\nThey believe that in-stadium communication is a key step on a longer-term journey to live VAR audio being accessible.\n\nThe Premier League have been creative in their use of the Match Officials Mic'd Up programme each weekend to provide transparency, but they are constrained from going any further by the limits of the International Football Association Board (IFAB), the governing body for the rules of the game across the world.\n\nYet, the mood music around VAR has been turning increasingly vitriolic.\n\nLast June, the Football Supporters Association conducted a survey of 9,645 fans across the country, with 63.3 per cent of fans opposing the use of VAR in English football and 79.1 per cent of match-goers rating their experience of VAR as poor or very poor.\n\nPrior to its introduction, the FSA had found 74.6 per cent of fans in favour of VAR, which shows how -- for many -- the reality has been decidedly different to what was expected.\n\nIt should be remembered that it was fans, managers and clubs not being prepared to accept human error that created the clamour for VAR in the first place, but there have been problems from the very start.\n\nIn October 2019, there was a meeting among clubs to discuss their belief that referees were avoiding going to the pitchside monitor, with the then VAR chief Neil Swarbrick grading the success of the implementation a \"seven out of 10\".\n\nA purported benefit of VAR was that it would dial down the heat around referees and reduce the focus on them in post-match analysis. After Anthony Taylor was attacked at the Europa League final between Sevilla and Roma last May, the Premier League brought in a Participant Behaviour Charter to try to protect their officials.\n\nBut 2023-24 only witnessed a ratcheting up of the toxicity.\n\nWhen a VAR miscommunication saw a Luis Diaz goal wrongly disallowed for offside against Tottenham in September, VAR chose not to rectify their mistake as play had resumed, which led to Jurgen Klopp calling for the game to be replayed.\n\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta went on a tirade calling the officiating of three VAR calls in the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United in November a 'disgrace'.\n\nNottingham Forest wrote letters of complaint to PGMOL, while also taking to social media to question the integrity of Stuart Attwell operating as a VAR official due to him supporting relegation rivals Luton Town.\n\nThe Independent Key Match Incidents Panel was set up two years ago and is run by former players and coaches to provide separation from PGMOL.\n\nESPN revealed the official list of the 31 incorrect VAR decisions last season, which showed that Liverpool had been the most hard done by with a net loss of four key decisions, with Wolves on the wrong end of three penalties and Nottingham Forest denied three of their own.\n\nThe difficulty, as has proven the case every matchday for five years, is that many fans were highlighting calls they felt were clearly and obviously wrong but had not been deemed to meet the subjective 'high bar' required to be overturned.\n\nManaging the noise has proven difficult, but at the start of every season, there are manager and captain meetings with every club to brief them on rule changes and VAR protocol, while media and broadcasters from around the world receive the same as well as a VAR handbook.\n\nRegular meetings happen with clubs throughout the season and if clubs are unhappy with a decision, they can seek an explanation from PGMOL's chief refereeing officer Howard Webb, who will often share the audio from the incident in question.\n\nWhen it comes to educating fans, there are still plenty of misconceptions which cause further frustration: not understanding that every decision is checked, even if there is no stoppage in the game;

Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_schlachter@cnn.com", "name": "Thomas Schlachter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Boly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willy Boly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Leagues", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1859854420.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Wolves require 14 clubs to vote in favour of ditching the technology. However, according to The Telegraph, via the Mirror, this is unlikely to occur.\n\nIt is suggested that league clubs - including Liverpool, Manchester United and West Ham - believe that the technology should stay in operation, but with modifications. The Premier League have already implemented tweaks ahead of the 2024/25 season.\n\nClubs are set to receive briefings on the automatic offside technology that is due to be used. It is hoped that this technology will reduce wait times caused by offside decisions by an average of 31 seconds.\n\nHoward Webb, the head of English referees, is also expected to make further changes to VAR. This includes making on-field announcements when any check is being made - audio that will be broadcast within stadiums.\n\nIn the run-up to Thursday's vote, the Premier League stated: \"The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the annual general meeting next month. Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.\n\n\"However, the league fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL [Professional Game Match Officials Limited], to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans.\n\n\"VAR has been a part of the Premier League since the 2019/20 season, after clubs unanimously voted to introduce the technology in November 2018.

The technology was first used at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and is expected to cut decision-making by over 30 seconds.\n\nReferees could well be mic'd up and use in-stadium announcements to explain their decisions to fans inside the ground, while the 'clear and obvious' threshold before an intervention will be strengthened.\n\nAnother potential improvement not entirely related to VAR is the possibly of looking to appoint elite foreign referees to matches, a suggestion mooted by several top clubs but not among the initial suggestions from the Premier League.\n\nMORE : Chelsea must find 'secret magic sum' to avoid breaking financial rules\n\nMORE : Manchester United fail with late move to sign Chelsea-bound signing on a free transfer", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_fleming@metro.co.uk", "name": "Ben Fleming", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_celebration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal celebration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Leagues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2091664325.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C74px%2C1024px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

might improve", "body": "VAR is set to be retained in the Premier League next season, despite Wolves calling a vote to abolish it.\n\nThat information, issued by Press Association on Wednesday afternoon, is in line with indications given by Albion chief executive Paul Barber recently.\n\nPA report it is not expected Wolves will come close to getting the 14-club majority needed to scrap VAR when clubs gather for their annual general meeting in Harrogate on Thursday.\n\nIt is understood they intend to push for a vote, even if it leads to a heavy defeat.\n\nWolves said last month VAR had led to \"numerous unintended consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football\" and that the system was \"undermining the Premier League brand\".\n\nAlbion have come out on the wrong end of several debatable VAR-related decisions in the last couple of seasons - and several where one wondered about the meaning of \"clear and obvious\" in terms of errors.\n\nBut Barber recently made it clear the expectation would be for VAR to continue, with improvements both in procedure and communication.\n\nHe addressed the subject when speaking to a meeting of the Seagulls Over London supporters group.\n\nA report of his reply, published by Albion, read: \"Assuming VAR stays in the Premier League, and our sense is it will, to improve the in-stadium experience next season, VAR decisions will be explained over the stadium PA and the VAR experience in grounds will vastly improve.\n\n\"We will also be introducing semi-automated offside technology, which will be quicker, much more accurate, and, we hope, far less controversial.\"\n\nBarber said he expected most clubs, Albion included, would want to see how these improvements helped.\n\nAlbion's deputy chairman has long said fans at a game should be informed about what was going on both on the pitch and at Stockley Park as far as possible.\n\nThere have been two occasions when supporters at the Amex were very well-informed and knew what the officials were saying.\n\nThat was back in 2015, when the stadium hosted a pair of matches in the Rugby World Cup with all that entailed - including headsets from which the referees' chat could be heard.\n\nThe Premier League will not go that far but, with the technology available, improved communication is both possible and important.\n\nPA report recent supporter surveys indicate strong opposition to VAR.\n\nFor example, a Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) poll of more than 16,000 Red Devils fans found less than 1% were in favour of keeping VAR in its current form.\n\nAlbion fans at the Amex have often voiced their disapproval of VAR during long delays in games while decisions are reached.\n\nBut a show of hands at the Seagulls Over London meeting came out heavily in favour of keeping VAR.\n\nOnly two people out of more than 60 in the room wanted it scrapped.\n\nBarber told that meeting there was an acceptance that VAR had \"diminished\" the matchday experience for fans.\n\nBut he is also concerned about the nature of increased scrutiny on officials.\n\nThe meeting report of his comments read: \"Constant criticism of the current pool of referees coming through the pyramid isn't helping.\n\n\"Many are being turned off from progressing because of the constant criticism of officials, and this is not only an immediate issue for lower levels of the game but a real concern for the future as it is from this group we will see future top officials emerge.\n\n\"At every level, our sport needs more match official talent not less.\n\nPrem clubs have already given unanimous support to the introduction of semi-automated offside technology in the autumn, which top-flight sources say will reduce the length of time of the average check by 31 seconds.\n\nDelays because of VAR were, on average, just over a minute per game in the Premier League in the 2023-24 season, roughly the same time as a goal celebration.\n\nThe Prem intervention rate is understood to be lower than that seen in UEFA and FIFA competitions, while 107 correct outcomes were recorded due to VAR last season according to the league's independent key match incidents (KMI) panel.\n\nThere is an argument that the worst VAR decision in an Albion match last season came not in domestic competition but in the Europa League, when Roma's third goal against them was not ruled out for offside.\n\nThe Premier League could introduce in-stadium announcements after VAR reviews in time for next season, a system seen at last year's Women's World Cup.", "source": {"uri":

Wolves - who last month called the vote - were understood to be adamant they wanted a debate to take place, even though they anticipated a heavy defeat. The club welcomed the chance to discuss VAR's failings on Thursday, with many rival teams agreeing further tweaks are needed urgently.\n\n\"While VAR produces more accurate decision making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters,\" the Premier League said in a statement following the 19-1 vote. \"As part of thorough discussions at the Annual General Meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL, the Premier League and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation.\"\n\nThe six key areas to improve include:\n\nThe league will also work with PGMOL, the refereeing body, on the \"implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy\".\n\nIt was confirmed in April that semi-automated offside technology will be introduced in the autumn of 2024. The Premier League and PGMOL say they will continue to lobby IFAB to allow greater flexibility in the Laws of the Game to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\n\nThe club vote took place in Yorkshire at a Premier League AGM just days before Manchester City's two-week private arbitration looms. The Telegraph disclosed earlier this week how the league was also set to advise clubs at the meeting to trial rather than vote on new squad cost controls and spending caps.\n\nAfter first tabling their motion to ditch VAR in England last month, Wolves warned the top tier was at risk of being \"irrevocably damaged\" if clubs did not support their proposal. The club's chairman Jeff Shi wrote in a column for The Telegraph that VAR has introduced \"a level of interference that is at odds with the spirit of our game\".\n\nClubs were given a full brief on a deal that has been struck with American software company Second Spectrum, which uses artificial intelligence and a chip in the ball to identify when attackers are ahead of defenders. Offside decisions should be cut by an average of 31 seconds, which, the Premier League hopes, will significantly reduce frustrations in the stands and dugouts. The Second Spectrum system will automatically detect when attackers are offside when the ball is kicked and the VAR will then judge if the attacker is interfering with play or not.\n\nClubs believe the improvements will ease sceptical fanbases, although the latest survey Ipsos UK shows the public is increasingly split on VAR. Figures showed 44 per cent wanted to ditch the technology while 40 per cent were in favour of protecting the status quo. Ipsos research director Keiran Pedley concluded \"fans do appear to be prepared to give VAR time if changes are made that improve the process\".", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technical area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q9AZ92sIBOW53mYGDKitHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/445b73b56c88432baae6bdeafc4f91db", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The league has also promised a new \"fan and stakeholder communication campaign\" to aid understanding of the purpose and use of VAR.\n\nIn a statement the league said: \"Premier League clubs today voted in favour of continuing to operate VAR in the Premier League. While VAR produces more accurate decision making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters.\n\n\"As part of thorough discussions at the annual general meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL [Professional Game Match Officials Limited], the Premier League and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation.\"\n\nThe league has announced six areas in which it hopes to improve VAR performance after a season in which the average delay in decision making increased by more than 50 per cent.\n\nThe biggest initiative will be the adoption of semi-automated offside technology after the autumn international break. It will use dedicated in-stadium cameras to calculate the position of a receiving player when a pass is played and end the need for VAR officials drawing manual lines to determine offsides. It has been predicted to reduce the average time taken to calculate an offside decision by more than half a minute.\n\nOther changes largely relate to communication. From next season referees will be able to announce the reason for a VAR overturn, such as handball or offside, providing a small improvement in the stadium experience for fans. The league says it also hopes to provide \"an enhanced offering of big-screen replays to include all VAR interventions\".\n\nThere will also be increased communication through the media, including the established Match Officials Mic'd Up broadcast on which the head of PGMOL, Howard Webb, talks through the most controversial decisions. A public communication plan is also promised to \"further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters\". Plans to improve training in VAR for match officials will also continue.\n\nThe league's six proposals have been anticipated, and there will be expectation that they deliver a real upturn in the performance of a system that is increasingly frustrating clubs and spectators. - Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_International_Match_Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA International Match Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Webb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard Webb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Leagues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/u0aXAXiImnmFwiiLFKABvDEvehM=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/4S6G6YNOLZDZBJVWKQH4AH6OYI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Wolves are the club driving the vote having been hard done by numerous times.\n\nVAR was introduced for the 2019/20 season and has continued to be divisive ever since. The proposal needs 14 votes from the 20 clubs for it to change, and it is understood that Wolves will get nowhere near the required number with VAR set to stay.\n\nChampions Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham are among clubs who want to keep VAR, but are demanding that improvements are made, according to the BBC. Another top flight club has said the VAR system at the moment \"isn't working\" and there \"clearly are issues\".\n\nWolves, when they tabled the motion, explained their motives in a statement. It read: \"There is no blame to be placed - we are all just looking for the best possible outcome for football - and all stakeholders have been working hard to try and make the introduction of additional technology a success.\n\n\"However, after five seasons of VAR in the Premier League, it is time for a constructive and critical debate on its future. Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards.\"\n\nOne change that is set to be introduced from next season in thde use of in-game VAR announcements from referees. FIFA introduced the trials at a number of its competitions last year and confirmed this would be extended after positive feedback.\n\nThe match referee will only be confirming decisions, rather than the process of how they arrived at that decision. No discussions involving the VAR will be heard, but the Premier League view the concept as a step forward.\n\nHoward Webb, who heads up the PGMOL, has been a strong defender of VAR and stated earlier this season that it \"would be foolish to take away a tool that can remove clear errors from the game - almost 40 this season. Usually we have seen around 100 situations rectified through the use of VAR.

Recognising the benefits of more accurate decision-making, the clubs also acknowledged the need for improvements to enhance the game and the experience for supporters.During the thorough discussions at the Premier League's Annual General Meeting (AGM), it was agreed that Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the Premier League, and the clubs have significant roles to play in refining the system and improving its reputation. Six key areas were highlighted as part of ongoing efforts to enhance VAR:\n\nHigh Threshold for VAR Intervention: To ensure greater consistency and fewer interruptions, the emphasis will be on maintaining a high threshold for when VAR should intervene.\n\nReducing game delays: The introduction of Semi-Automated Offside Technology (SAOT) in the autumn of 2024 is expected to minimize delays, complemented by the high intervention threshold.\n\nImproving fan experience: Efforts will be made to reduce delays and enhance in-stadium announcements from referees after VAR decisions.

Last season, VAR came under even greater scrutiny as officials made a number of contentious - often wrong - decisions while using VAR.\n\nThe Premier League also said that it has discussed making improvements in how VAR operates, which includes \"improving [the] fan experience\" of VAR checks, \"more robust training\" for officials and \"increasing transparency and communication around\" the system.\n\nDuring the 2024-25 season, the Premier League will also be introducing semi-automated offside technology (SAOT), a change that had been agreed at the organization's shareholders' meeting in April.\n\nSAOT is already used in the Champions League and was also used at the 2022 World Cup.\n\n\"The new system will be used for the first time in the Premier League next season, and it is anticipated the technology will be ready to be introduced after one of the autumn international breaks,\" said the Premier League in an April statement regarding the introduction of SAOT.\n\nPer the Premier League, all rule changes and major broadcast and commercial proposals require the approval of at least two-thirds vote, or a minimum of 14 of the 20 clubs in the league.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the 20 teams voted 19-1 to keep VAR, with just Wolverhampton Wanderers in favor of removing it.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Premier League to confirm these reports.\n\nWolves was also the Premier League club who tabled the vote having been irked by a number of refereeing decisions this season.\n\n\"There is no blame to be placed - we are all just looking for the best possible outcome for football - and all stakeholders have been working hard to try and make the introduction of additional technology a success,\" the club said in a statement to CNN in May.\n\n\"However, after five seasons of VAR in the Premier League it is time for a constructive and critical debate on its future. Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Improving fan experience through a reduction in the delays, in-stadium announcements from referees after a post-VAR change of decision and where possible, an enhanced offering of big screen replays to include all VAR interventions. Working with PGMOL on the implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy. Increasing transparency and communication around VAR - including expanded communications from Premier League Match Centre and through broadcast programming such as Match Officials Mic'd Up. The delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign, which will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters.\n\nWolves felt particularly frustrated with a vast amount of decisions going against them during the 2023/24 season, while Nottingham Forest were also unhappy with inconsistency across the campaign.

Five years ago, when it was first introduced, VAR was heralded as a foolproof system. Sneaky handballs, unfair red cards, onside-offside mix-ups: all would be gone. The refereeing would be perfect. But, even after five years, VAR is still too slow and its decision-making too opaque. It's wrong, too. There have been around 20 game-changing errors every season since its introduction. Football can't continue in this state.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers forced the vote, claiming VAR had 'damaged the relationship between football and fans'. They're right. VAR ruins the spontaneity of goal celebrations and slows down the game. Matches are routinely stopped for several minutes as officials struggle to reach a verdict. It's no surprise that, following the introduction of VAR, match time added at the end of games has increased to, at times, a ridiculous 11 and a half minutes.\n\nHowever, there's a cynical element to Wolves' protest. The club has had seven incorrect VAR calls go against them this season and only one in their favour, the worst record in the Premier League. Clubs with a similar deficit see the vote as an opportunity to get rid of VAR, believing that it unduly punishes their performances, Wolves finished 14th this season - mid-table mediocrity - and they want to do better.\n\nFor many clubs like Wolves, big victories in a season don't occur often. It's fair for their fans to be outraged when a VAR error strips their team of a memorable win. The feeling is almost universal: 95 per cent of fans say that the current VAR process ruins the spontaneity of the sport and is unnecessarily long. Many pundits agree: 'Let referees ref it and understand they will make mistakes,' said Wayne Rooney recently. A further nine-in-ten fans of lower league teams are opposed to the system being imposed on them due to it slowing the game. They've seen the chaos VAR has caused the top league and would prefer to stick with the status quo.\n\nBut this misses the point. The issue is not VAR itself, but how officials have implemented it, and run the system. Premier League bosses insist that VAR has been objectively effective; it's increased the proportion of correct decisions from 82 per cent to 96 per cent. But there's a fallacy in their logic: this reasoning assumes all decisions are objective, whereas many rely on the referee's subjective interpretations of the laws of the game. There's no catch-all solution, after all, for a small tug on a players' shirt, the ball glancing a hand, or a '50/50' challenge.\n\nThere was originally much support for VAR after France beat Ireland in a 2010 World Cup qualifier. The referee didn't see that Thierry Henry used his hand to assist a winning goal, so France went to the tournament instead of Ireland. It was scandals such as that which led to the head of the football rulemaking board, IFAB, to claim that VAR was needed to 'protect referees from making mistakes that everyone can see immediately.' However, far from protecting referees, VAR's implementation has been so unclear and its decisions often lopsided that referees are slammed more than ever.\n\nFootball should have looked to rugby for the solution. Rugby's version of the VAR, the televised match official (TMO), is much clearer for fans. What's different is that decisions are clearly explained and shown on screens. It works because, as top former rugby referee Nigel Owens says, 'everyone watching the game in the stadium or at home knows what's happening' The referee, under advice from the TMO, still makes judgment calls, and often controversial ones. In the World Cup final last October, New Zealand's captain's yellow card was upgraded to a red by the TMO. Yet some minutes later, the same official deemed South Africa's captain's yellow card to be just, despite both high tackles being extremely similar. South Africa went on to win the final. Rugby fans were less aggrieved by the decision than their football counterparts would have been. At least they were to see a quick and clear decision-making process. If it works for rugby why not football?\n\nIf the Premier League is hesitant to broadcast decisions then they should look to remove unnecessary human input from some decisions altogether, especially in offsides. One of last season's most blatant VAR errors was when officials failed to overturn a disallowed goal when Liverpool faced Tottenham, possibly costing Liverpool the game. The VAR back and forth was eventually released: 'That's wrong that, Daz.' 'Oh f -- !' 'Delay delay.' 'Can't do anything.' 'Stop the game!' 'Can't do anything!'\n\nThe technology for automating these decisions has existed for years and was successfully trialled at the last World Cup. Automation would apply consistent rules to each decision and cut the review time in half. Despite this, the Premier League blocked its introduction last year. After all those VAR mistakes this season, it U-turned and promised it would be up and running for next season.\n\nAutomating VAR is the only solution for more accurate and faster decisions, but instead of that being the focus, it's become an obsession over whether we should have it or not.\n\nThe Premier League wanted a consistent system to catch simple referring errors. It has not found that. Automation is the only practical way to save VAR, and save VAR we should. It's easy to look back at Thierry Henry's handball and feel the sting less keenly. Fans and pundits should ask: is VAR really worse than that?", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_celebration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal celebration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1875535022.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Those areas include raising the bar required for technology to intervene and reducing delays on the game.\n\nThe proposal to scrap VAR from Premier League action after five season was driven by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Any such change would have required 14 votes in favour from the 20 clubs.\n\nA Premier League statement read: \"Premier League clubs today voted in favour of continuing to operate VAR in the Premier League. While VAR produces more accurate decision making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters.\n\n\"As part of thorough discussions at the Annual General Meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL, the Premier League and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation. As part of ongoing work to improve VAR, six key areas were focussed on as part of discussions with clubs:\n\nMaintaining a high threshold for VAR intervention to deliver greater consistency and less interruptions to the flow of the game. Reducing delays to the game, primarily through the introduction of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) and the maintained high threshold for VAR intervention. Improving fan experience through a reduction in the delays, in-stadium announcements from referees after a post-VAR change of decision and where possible, an enhanced offering of big screen replays to include all VAR interventions. Working with PGMOL on the implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy. Increasing transparency and communication around VAR - including expanded communications from Premier League Match Centre and through broadcast programming such as Match Officials Mic'd Up. The delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign, which will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters.\n\n\"It was confirmed in April that Semi-Automated Offside Technology will be introduced in the autumn of 2024. The technology will provide quicker and consistent placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player tracking, and will produce high-quality broadcast graphics to ensure an enhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for supporters.\n\n\"The Premier League and PGMOL will continue to lobby IFAB to allow greater flexibility in the Laws of the Game to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\"\n\nThere will be more to follow on this breaking news story and Mirror Sport will bring you the very latest updates, pictures and video as soon as possible.\n\nPlease check back regularly for updates on this developing story.\n\nFollow us on Google News, Flipboard, Apple News, Twitter, Facebook or visit The Mirror homepage.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_trotter@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scott Trotter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32832179.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-City-v-Wolverhampton-Wanderers-Premier-League.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The feeling is that rolling back to allow those errors to return to the game would, at this point, not be acceptable.\n\nEarlier this season Tony Scholes, the league's chief football officer, said that there were \"too many checks\" that are \"taking too long,\" but that the Premier League was fully committed to VAR.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the Premier League posted a job advert for an additional communications role which would involve some work from Stockley Park on VAR on match days.\n\nWith 38 VAR errors in 2022-23, the Premier League will also point to a 21% drop in mistakes year-on-year to show things are getting better, despite some high profile incidents. Yet the problem is there are many more situations outside of those identified by the KMI Panel which managers and fans will feel are wrong.\n\nClubs will, however, approve referees announcing the explanation for a VAR overturn to the crowd. This will largely only apply to a referee visiting the pitchside monitor to overturn a subjective decision, which happened 66 times last season. It will not apply to the occasions when a VAR checks and opts not to send the referee to the screen, so for instance three penalty incidents which incensed Nottingham Forest in their 2-0 loss at Everton in April.\n\nIt's hoped that this will remove some of the inertia inside a stadium about why a decision has been changed, but it is unlikely to go far enough to placate fans who feel VAR has taken far more away from the game than it has added.\n\nThe AGM comes less than two months after the 20 Premier League clubs voted to introduce semiautomated offside technology (SAOT) next season, which involves a contract with a new offside technology supplier, Second Spectrum. That will be delayed until after one of the autumn international breaks as further testing is required to ensure the system is robust.\n\nIt is hoped that SAOT will, on average, make offside decisions 31 seconds quicker by removing the human aspect of the VAR drawing lines onto the players. But this technology isn't going to make offside calls instant, there is likely to be an increased number of marginal decisions as, unlikely the current Hawk-Eye software, SAOT doesn't have a built-in tolerance level, and some situations -- where several players are involved in close proximity -- the VAR may have to resort to using the old Hawk-Eye system.\n\nSecond Spectrum has been the official tracking provider of the Premier League since 2020, and will use artificial intelligence (AI)-powered skeletal tracking technology -- which provides the foundation for SAOT. However, as in Serie A and the UEFA Champions League there won't be a chip within the ball to automatically detect the kick-point. So far this has only been used at the FIFA World Cup, but it will be used by UEFA for the first time at Euro 2024.\n\nContrary to some reports, there is no discussion planned about the possible use of foreign referees.

The Midlands side claimed that VAR was damaging the relationship between fans and the sport, while the technology was \"at odds with the spirit of the game\".\n\nThat vote will now come to a head later this week at a shareholders' meeting. All 17 clubs who were in the Premier League will attend, as well as the three promoted clubs Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton.\n\nThe meeting will take place on Thursday, June 6, in Harrogate. Wolves need 14 clubs to vote in favour of scrapping the technology. But according to The Telegraph, that is unlikely to happen.\n\nIt is suggested that clubs in the league - including Liverpool, Manchester United and West Ham - believe that the technology should remain in action, but with alterations. The Premier League have already introduced tweaks ahead of the 2024/25 season.\n\nClubs are due to be given briefs into the automatic offside technology set to be used. It is hoped that the technology will cut wait times caused by offside decisions by an average of 31 seconds.\n\nHoward Webb, the head of English referees, is also set to make further changes to VAR. That includes making on-field announcements when any check is being made - audio that will be broadcast within stadiums.\n\nAhead of Thursday's vote, the Premier League said: \"The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the annual general meeting next month. Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.\n\nShould VAR be scrapped? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\n\"However, the league fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL [Professional Game Match Officials Limited], to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans.\"\n\nVAR has been used in the Premier League since the 2019/20 season. Clubs had voted unanimously to introduce the technology back in November 2018.\n\nCalling on clubs to reverse that vote, Wolves said: \"The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart.\n\n\"However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand. The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League, PGMOL and our fellow competitors.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

More info\n\nPremier League clubs have unanimously voted to retain the use of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology, but with a commitment to enhance its application.\n\nThe decision was made during Thurday's meeting where the 20 top-flight teams agreed to concentrate on six main areas for improvement. These include increasing the threshold for intervention and minimising game disruptions. Wolverhampton Wanderers had spearheaded a proposal to abolish VAR after five seasons in the Premier League, arguing that it was time for 'a constructive and critical debate' on the system's future. They highlighted nine ways in which they believe VAR has negatively impacted the league.\n\nDespite their efforts, the motion seemed doomed from the start, particularly at the Annual General Meeting held in Harrogate. In a statement, the Premier League confirmed: \"Premier League clubs today voted in favour of continuing to operate VAR in the Premier League. While VAR produces more accurate decision making, it was agreed that improvements should be made for the benefit of the game and supporters,\" reports the Mirror.\n\nThe statement further detailed: \"As part of thorough discussions at the Annual General Meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL, the Premier League and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation. As part of ongoing work to improve VAR, six key areas were focussed on as part of discussions with clubs.\n\n\"It was confirmed in April that Semi-Automated Offside Technology will be introduced in the autumn of 2024. The technology will provide quicker and consistent placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player tracking, and will produce high-quality broadcast graphics to ensure an enhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for supporters.\"\n\n\"The Premier League and PGMOL will continue to lobby IFAB to allow greater flexibility in the Laws of the Game to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_evans@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Anthony Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32975129.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_VAR-File-Photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Yet the problem is there are many more situations outside of those identified by the KMI Panel which managers and fans will feel are wrong.\n\nClubs did, however, approve referees announcing the explanation for a VAR overturn to the crowd. This will largely only apply to a referee visiting the pitchside monitor to overturn a subjective decision, which happened 66 times last season. It will not apply to the occasions when a VAR checks and opts not to send the referee to the screen, so for instance three penalty incidents which incensed Nottingham Forest in their 2-0 loss at Everton in April.\n\nIt's hoped that this will remove some of the inertia inside a stadium about why a decision has been changed, but it is unlikely to go far enough to placate fans who feel VAR has taken far more away from the game than it has added.\n\nThe AGM comes less than two months after the 20 Premier League clubs voted to introduce semiautomated offside technology (SAOT) next season, which involves a contract with a new offside technology supplier, Second Spectrum. That will be delayed until after one of the autumn international breaks as further testing is required to ensure the system is robust.\n\nIt is hoped that SAOT will, on average, make offside decisions 31 seconds quicker by removing the human aspect of the VAR drawing lines onto the players. But this technology isn't going to make offside calls instant, there is likely to be an increased number of marginal decisions as, unlikely the current Hawk-Eye software, SAOT doesn't have a built-in tolerance level, and some situations -- where several players are involved in close proximity -- the VAR may have to resort to using the old Hawk-Eye system.\n\nSecond Spectrum has been the official tracking provider of the Premier League since 2020, and will use artificial intelligence (AI)-powered skeletal tracking technology -- which provides the foundation for SAOT. However, as in Serie A and the UEFA Champions League there won't be a chip within the ball to automatically detect the kick-point. So far this has only been used at the FIFA World Cup, but it will be used by UEFA for the first time at Euro 2024.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_replay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instant replay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk-Eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawk-Eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1127%2Fr1258583_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Most clubs think it's better to look for ways to improve the current system rather than scrapping it entirely.\n\nThe Premier League has been using VAR since 2019, but according to the numbers, the fact is that it is working.

VAR has fielded plenty of criticism since it was introduced in the top flight five years ago but there is appetite among many clubs to persist with it. Other things on the agenda at the AGM are a possible spending cap and tweaks to profit and sustainability rules.\n\nVAR is set to remain a part of the Premier League, with Wolves' proposal to scrap the technology to be rejected at the top flight's annual general meeting this week. The AGM will take place on Thursday, June 6, where clubs will discuss and vote on a variety of topics ahead of the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nThe subject that will be of most interest to football fans is Wolves' proposal to abolish video assistant referees in the top flight. VAR courted controversy throughout the 2023-24 season due to a number of high-profile errors made by Premier League officials.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistics: VAR made a total of 31 mistakes in the Premier League during the 2023/24 season\n\nThe system has been in place in the top flight since 2019 but has faced a number of teething issues. However, Wolves' proposal is not expected to get the 14 votes that it needs for VAR to be scrapped, with clubs favouring improvements to the system rather than getting rid of it altogether.\n\nClubs Favour Improving VAR Over Scrapping It Technology has been flawed since its introduction in 2019\n\nGIVEMESPORT reported last week that the motion to remove VAR was unlikely to pass, and The Telegraph now say that the ballot is expected to fall in favour of retaining the technology and making significant improvements to it.\n\nOne seemingly guaranteed improvement to the efficiency of VAR in the Premier League will be the introduction of a semi-automated offside system, which will increase the speed and accuracy of offside decisions. Football fans have been left frustrated by the long waits they have faced to discover whether a goal will stand or not, with many believing the spontaneity of celebrating a goal has been taken away by technology.\n\nThe semi-automated offside technology will be provided by American software company Second Spectrum, which uses artificial intelligence and a chip in the ball to identify when attackers are ahead of defenders.\n\nOther Topics to be Discussed at AGM Spending cap and PSR tweaks\n\nOther things on the agenda include squad cost controls and a potential spending cap. The Premier League is moving towards a cost-control model similar to Uefa's, which sees clubs' spending limited to a percentage of their turnover.\n\nA cap would be further cost control, and it could see clubs being restricted to spending no more than a percentage of the lowest-finishing team in the league's income from broadcast and commercial deals. It is reported that the PFA could push back on that idea as it could impact players' earnings.\n\nSome clubs are also set to propose more lenient profit and sustainability rules, with Aston Villa said to want to increase Premier League clubs' permitted losses over a three-year period from \u00a3105million to \u00a3135million, while Crystal Palace believe that the Premier League clubs who do not qualify to play in Europe are currently at a disadvantage when it comes to the money they are allowed to lose.\n\nRelated Man City 'Launch Unprecedented Legal Action' Against Premier League Manchester City are suing the Premier League.\n\nThat's because clubs competing in the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League earn significant money from doing so, and thus have more financial leeway. Until this is changed, clubs lower down the Premier League table will find it difficult to challenge those teams who regularly figure at the top of the table.\n\nOne thing that won't be discussed at the meeting is the package of financial support for the Football League, with the Premier League prioritising sorting out its own new financial systems before exploring that issue.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_celebration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal celebration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Footballers' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-04-at-19-21-53.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 170, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The feeling is that rolling back to allow those errors to return to the game would, at this point, not be acceptable.\n\nEarlier this season Tony Scholes, the league's chief football officer, said that there were \"too many checks\" that are \"taking too long,\" but that the Premier League was fully committed to VAR.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the Premier League posted a job advert for an additional communications role which would involved some work from Stockley Park on VAR on match days.\n\nWith 38 VAR errors in 2022-23, the Premier League will also point to a 21% drop in mistakes year-on-year to show things are getting better, despite some high profile incidents. Yet the problem is there are many more situations outside of those identified by the KMI Panel which managers and fans will feel are wrong.\n\nClubs will, however, approve referees announcing the explanation for a VAR overturn to the crowd. This will largely only apply to a referee visiting the pitchside monitor to overturn a subjective decision, which happened 66 times last season. It will not apply to the occasions when a VAR checks and opts not to send the referee to the screen, so for instance three penalty incidents which incensed Nottingham Forest in their 2-0 loss at Everton in April.\n\nIt's hoped that this will remove some of the inertia inside a stadium about why a decision has been changed, but it is unlikely to go far enough to placate fans who feel VAR has taken far more away from the game than it has added.\n\nThe AGM comes less than two months after the 20 Premier League clubs voted to introduce semiautomated offside technology (SAOT) next season, which involves a contract with a new offside technology supplier, Second Spectrum. That will be delayed until after one of the autumn international breaks as further testing is required to ensure the system is robust.\n\nIt is hoped that SAOT will, on average, make offside decisions 31 seconds quicker by removing the human aspect of the VAR drawing lines onto the players. But this technology isn't going to make offside calls instant, there is likely to be an increased number of marginal decisions as, unlikely the current Hawk-Eye software, SAOT doesn't have a built-in tolerance level, and some situations -- where several players are involved in close proximity -- the VAR may have to resort to using the old Hawk-Eye system.\n\nSecond Spectrum has been the official tracking provider of the Premier League since 2020, and will use artificial intelligence (AI)-powered skeletal tracking technology -- which provides the foundation for SAOT. However, as in Serie A and the UEFA Champions League there won't be a chip within the ball to automatically detect the kick-point. So far this has only been used at the FIFA World Cup, but it will be used by UEFA for the first time at Euro 2024.\n\nContrary to some reports, there is no discussion planned about the possible use of foreign referees.

including expanded communications from Premier League Match Centre and through broadcast programming such as Match Officials Mic'd Up.\n\n\"6) The delivery of a fan and stakeholder VAR communication campaign, which will seek to further clarify VAR's role in the game to participants and supporters.\n\n\"It was confirmed in April that Semi-Automated Offside Technology will be introduced in the autumn of 2024.\n\n\"The technology will provide quicker and consistent placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player tracking, and will produce high-quality broadcast graphics to ensure an enhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for supporters.\n\n\"The Premier League and PGMOL will continue to lobby IFAB to allow greater flexibility in the Laws of the Game to allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.\"\n\nInstalling the technology required for VAR is among the projects being undertaken at Portman Road this summer.\n\nElsewhere, former Blues loanee Tyreece John-Jules, 23, has been released by Arsenal having spent last season on loan with Derby County.\n\nForward John-Jules, who posted a photo wearing a Town shirt during some private training this morning, spent 2022/23 at Portman Road.\n\nMeanwhile, ex-Town striker Jordan Rhodes, 34, has rejoined Blackpool, where he spent last season on loan, on a permanent basis having been released by Huddersfield.", "source": {"uri": "twtd.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "TWTD.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyreece_John-Jules", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyreece John-Jules"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_County_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derby County F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blackpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portman_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portman Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huddersfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huddersfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.twtd.co.uk/images/news/16125.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Reducing delays to the game, primarily through the introduction of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) and the maintained high threshold for VAR intervention. Improving fan experience through a reduction in the delays, in-stadium announcements from referees after a post-VAR change of decision and where possible, an enhanced offering of big screen replays to include all VAR interventions. Working with PGMOL on the implementation of more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy.

The gathering also comes just days before the Premier League is set to defend a legal claim brought by its current champions, Manchester City.\n\nWhile it is anticipated that Wolves will fall short of the 14 votes needed to make changes to Premier League rules, submissions made by the league in response to the club seem to confirm a central premise of the complaint; that VAR has caused too much disruption to the game.\n\nAccording to the briefing written by the league's director of football, Tony Scholes, the average delay on a VAR check lasted 64 seconds in the 2023-24 season, up from 40 seconds the season before. Scholes attributes the lengthened delays to officials taking more time to ensure decisions are correct after the notorious failure to award Liverpool a legitimate goal during their 2-1 defeat at Tottenham last September.\n\nIn their own six-page briefing, which has been distributed to clubs before the AGM, Wolves argue that \"the use of VAR has led to increased disengagement among the Premier League's match-attending fans due to its adverse effects on the match experience\", and that \"the current version of VAR is incompatible with the subjective nature of football laws, risking the league's standing as the best in the world.\"\n\nIn the league's response, Scholes argues that the planned introduction of semi-automatic offside technology should cut delays next season. He also warns of the costs of replacing VAR and reveals a planned change in official language, with the phrase \"clear and obvious\" to be retired as a benchmark for VAR interventions.\n\nInstead the term \"referee's call\" will be introduced, with the intention of clarifying the primacy of any on-field decision. Such decisions should only be overturned in the event that they are \"clearly wrong\", according to the new terminology.\n\nIn other developments, plans to reform the league's equally-controversial Profit and Sustainability Rules are to be pushed back. Officials had expressed their intention to agree new rules this summer, with plans involving an 'anchoring' scheme at their heart. This proposal would see limits imposed on player-related expenditure, whereby the league's richest clubs could only spend a fixed multiple of the earnings of the division's bottom side.\n\nWhile anchoring was approved in principle by clubs in a vote in April, it has since encountered pushback from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) who fear the move could lead to a de facto salary cap and have hired legal representation to challenge it. Now the Premier League has stepped back from putting the full range of financial regulations to a confirmatory vote at the AGM and instead will trial anchoring and squad cost ratio measures in shadow form from next season.\n\nLeague sources argue this is an improvement on the previous proposal, giving clubs a chance to assess strengths and weaknesses before a final vote is taken next year.\n\nThe independent tribunal that will hear City's case against the Premier League, whereby the four-in-a-row champions are challenging everything from sponsorship rules to the means by which decisions are taken by the competition, is set to last two weeks. - Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrogate", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrogate"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrogate"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Footballers' Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/ZAjEBP2HacK3quIvG39YwqJTguw=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/XXSSMDXMMHMEXVEOTGAWPXZJG4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

It read: \"As part of thorough discussions at the Annual General Meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL, the Premier League and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation. As part of ongoing work to improve VAR, six key areas were focused on as part of discussions with clubs.\"\n\nMaintaining a high threshold for intervening is among the areas they want to target. A reduction in delays have also been cited as a key work on, but they anticipate this will be aided by the introduction of the semi-automated offside system.\n\nImproving the fan experience is another area that improvements can be made, which can be helped with through a reduction in the delays, in-stadium announcements from referees after a VAR results in the changing of a decision.\n\nVoted in favour of scrapping\n\nWolves\n\nVoted in favour of keeping\n\nArsenal\n\nAston Villa\n\nBournemouth\n\nBrentford\n\nBrighton\n\nChelsea\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nEverton\n\nFulham\n\nIpswich\n\nLeicester\n\nLiverpool\n\nMan City\n\nMan Utd\n\nNewcastle\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nSouthampton\n\nTottenham\n\nWest Ham\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Such is the frustration regarding VAR, that Premier League clubs are actually going to vote on whether or not it should be removed from the game. Frustrations towards VAR were recently summarised well by former Manchester United star, Wayne Rooney, when he said that we still get human error even with video assisted refereeing. This is one of the central critiques of the technology.\n\nVAR seemed like a natural positive progression for football after the incredibly successful implementation of goal line technology. Goal line technology was first implemented in the Premier League during the 2013/14 season and overall has proved a remarkable success. This success is in part down to the simple black-or-white, objective nature associated with the decision goal line technology is asked to make; has the ball crossed the line or not?\n\nVAR on the other hand is an attempt to introduce objectivity into what are usually somewhat subjective decisions. What happens with most VAR calls is that a foul is replayed for the referee, who then gets another chance to make their decision. While this does provide the referee with more information than they would have during live games, it doesn't remove human error from the officiating process because it is still a human making the decision.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

Anyone who thinks life as a football fan was rosy before VAR, is misremembering the major calls to introduce the technology into the game to reduce incorrect decisions. Accordingly, if we must live with VAR, here are my three tips to improve the technology's application in the Premier League.\n\n1. Verbalise decisions\n\nThe rugby Champions Cup final in May provided a wonderful illustration of something football can learn from rugby union. During the final, the officials made a decision to send off Toulouse's Richie Arnold. This was done after a review of a tackle which was deemed to merit a red card. The decision was verbalised by both the on-field ref and the video assistant ref. The tackle was high, contact was initiated from shoulder to head, and there were no mitigating circumstances. Case shut and closed, that's a red card.\n\nPremier League matches should adopt a similar strategy, whereby in order to stop games and send the referee to the monitor, the video assistant referee must have to explicitly verbalise why they think an incorrect decision has been made, and not just send the referee to the monitor \"for a look\". This would have 2 major benefits: Firstly, it may help the officials determine whether intervention is necessary by requiring them to explicitly communicate their rationale for overturning a decision. Secondly, it improves the transparency of the decisions being made for teams and fans. Currently, we can't hear the decisions being made by officials and are left to fill in the blanks ourselves. Compelling referees to verbalise the rationale for their decision would provide players, coaches, and fans with the justification for the decision which has been made.\n\nWe need your consent to load this YouTube contentWe use YouTube to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

VAR as a tool - not a corrector\n\nFormer Premier League official, Mike Dean, revealed on a podcast that he once didn't overturn a referee's decision because the referee was \"a mate\" and he felt bad for him. This showcases a major issue with VAR in the Premier League. It is not viewed as a tool to help officials, but rather a corrective device used to send refs to the naughty corner when they have made a mistake. This has to be cut out because the efficacy of VAR is dependent on the official's willingness to use the technology when it is needed. Again, I feel football can learn something from rugby here.\n\nReferees in rugby union are in constant discourse with the video assistant officials when making decisions. You will frequently hear rugby union referees say they phrase 'On-field decision is... Can you check for...'\n\nThis is a brilliant system. The referee acknowledges that the decision they have made is based on what they were able to observe on the field and they then initiate the use of VAR and ask the video assistant official to check for mitigating circumstances, like fouls or offsides, which may render their on-field decision incorrect. At no point is the ref sent to the monitor because they have made a bad mistake. Instead they are an equal participant in the VAR process and are using the technology to improve their own decisions.\n\n3. Widen the pool of officials\n\nThe Premier League is widely regarded as the best league in World football. The success of the Premier League is much owed to the international approach it adopted later in 1990s. The 1995 Bosman ruling, which saw Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman take a case to the European Court of Justice, allowed all European players to move freely to the league. But the Premier League also has some of the finest players from Africa, Asia, and South America. This widens the pool of talent available to the Premier League which allows it to be the very best. If Manchester City were to rely solely on players from Manchester to pick form then it would be difficult for them to achieve the same level of success which they have, because this geographical restriction would omit too many valuable players from around the world, who could then play for their rivals.\n\nRead more: Lights, cameras, football: how live football took over TV\n\nSo why is the Premier League refereed by nearly exclusively English officials? With the exception of the Australian official, Jarred Gillet, every single referee in the Premier League this season was English. How statistically likely is it that the best officials in the world all just so happen to be from England? Probably close to zero. Widen the talent pool of officials in the Premier League and give VAR a chance to succeed.\n\nFollow RT\u00c9 Brainstorm on WhatsApp and Instagram for more stories and updates\n\nThe views expressed

It was therefore a discussion point at the Premier League's annual general meeting with the decision being put to the clubs. It would've needed 14 votes to get passed.\n\nIt is understood that Wolves were adamant they wanted to pursue it even though they anticipated a heavy defeat, which proved to be the case. Their 19 top flight rivals all chose to keep VAR in place, although there is an acceptance it needs improving.\n\nOne top flight club said in the lead up to the meeting that the VAR system at the moment \"isn't working\" and there \"clearly are issues\".\n\nWhen Wolves put forward their argument they said: \"After five seasons of VAR in the Premier League, it is time for a constructive and critical debate on its future. Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards.\"\n\nAfter the vote a statement was released by the Premier League, whereby they accepted that changes were necessary as they pinpointed areas to target. It read: \"As part of thorough discussions at the Annual General Meeting, it was agreed that PGMOL, the Premier League and clubs all have important roles to play in improving the system and its reputation. As part of ongoing work to improve VAR, six key areas were focused on as part of discussions with clubs.\"\n\nMaintaining a high threshold for intervening is among the areas they want to target. A reduction in delays have also been cited as a key work on, but they anticipate this will be aided by the introduction of the semi-automated offside system.\n\nImproving the fan experience is another area that improvements can be made, which can be helped with through a reduction in the delays, in-stadium announcements from referees after a VAR results in the changing of a decision.\n\nVoted in favour of scrapping\n\nWolves\n\nVoted in favour of keeping\n\nArsenal\n\nAston Villa\n\nBournemouth\n\nBrentford\n\nBrighton\n\nChelsea\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nEverton\n\nFulham\n\nIpswich\n\nLeicester\n\nLiverpool\n\nMan City\n\nMan Utd\n\nNewcastle\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nSouthampton\n\nTottenham\n\nWest Ham\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The gathering also comes just days before the Premier League is set to defend a legal claim brought by its current champions, Manchester City.\n\nRelated: Manchester City chair warns Premier League is to become less competitive\n\nWhile it is anticipated that Wolves will fall short of the 14 votes needed to make changes to Premier League rules, submissions made by the league in response to the club seem to confirm a central premise of the complaint; that VAR has caused too much disruption to the game.\n\nAccording to the briefing written by the league's director of football, Tony Scholes, and seen by the Guardian, the average delay on a VAR check lasted 64 seconds in the 2023-24 season, up from 40 seconds the season before. Scholes attributes the lengthened delays to officials taking more time to ensure decisions are correct after the notorious failure to award Liverpool a legitimate goal during their 2-1 defeat at Tottenham last September.\n\nIn their own six-page briefing, which has been distributed to clubs before the AGM, Wolves argue that \"the use of VAR has led to increased disengagement among the Premier League's match-attending fans due to its adverse effects on the match experience\", and that \"the current version of VAR is incompatible with the subjective nature of football laws, risking the league's standing as the best in the world.\"\n\nIn the league's response, Scholes argues that the planned introduction of semi-automatic offside technology should cut delays next season. He also warns of the costs of replacing VAR and reveals a planned change in official language, with the phrase \"clear and obvious\" to be retired as a benchmark for VAR interventions. Instead the term \"referee's call\" will be introduced, with the intention of clarifying the primacy of any on-field decision. Such decisions should only be overturned in the event that they are \"clearly wrong\", according to the new terminology.\n\nIn other developments, plans to reform the league's equally-controversial Profit and Sustainability Rules are to be pushed back. Officials had expressed their intention to agree new rules this summer, with plans involving an 'anchoring' scheme at their heart. This proposal would see limits imposed on player-related expenditure, whereby the league's richest clubs could only spend a fixed multiple of the earnings of the division's bottom side.\n\nWhile anchoring was approved in principle by clubs in a vote in April, it has since encountered pushback from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) who fear the move could lead to a de facto salary cap and have hired legal representation to challenge it. Now the Premier League has stepped back from putting the full range of financial regulations to a confirmatory vote at the AGM and instead will trial anchoring and squad cost ratio measures in shadow form from next season.\n\nLeague sources argue this is an improvement on the previous proposal, giving clubs a chance to assess strengths and weaknesses before a final vote is taken next year.\n\nThe independent tribunal that will hear City's case against the Premier League, whereby the four-in-a-row champions are challenging everything from sponsorship rules to the means by which decisions are taken by the competition, is set to last two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrogate", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrogate"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrogate"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Footballers' Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/fbb632bbc86901d216df8e1d9469daa9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

They will be used to shadow PSR and evaluate whether they will work but the underlying message was to ensure that the Premier League remains competitive and strong.\n\nEverton and Nottingham Forest were hit with punishments for overspending while other clubs complain they cannot compete with the big boys.

This protection is intended not to have an impact unless significant revenue divergence of clubs occurs.\"\n\nPremier League clubs have also voted overwhelmingly to keep VAR. But it came after a pledge from referees' bosses to improve the current video assistant referee system.\n\nWolves tabled a motion to scrap VAR after they complained they were on the wrong end of a string of controversial decisions. However, the vote came out 19-1 against ditching VAR after Professional Game Match Officials Limited chief Howard Webb made a presentation at the Premier League Annual General Meeting in Harrogate.\n\nThe Premier League had also sent a \"VAR Improvement Plan\" to clubs before the meeting which was written by chief football officer Tony Scholes. It claimed there would have be another 100 incorrect decisions without VAR despite uproar from fans about delays, consistency and a lack of information for fans in the stadiums.\n\nWolves had lobbied hard amongst their Premier League rivals as manager Gary O'Neil had bemoaned VAR decisions going against them throughout the season. Wolves insisted they should have had a penalty at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the season after Manchester United keeper Andre Onana clattered into Sasa Kalajdzic.\n\nThey were also furious after having a late goal ruled out against West Ham and sent a letter to rival clubs, saying VAR had \"compromised the integrity of the game.\" Premier League chiefs have confirmed that semi-automated offsides will be brought in next season.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The majority of clubs favour VAR but want improvements made to it.\n\nPremier League stats earlier this season showed correct decisions had increased from 82 to 96 per cent under VAR, with Tony Scholes, the Premier League's chief football officer, telling Sky Sports in February: \"VAR is, and remains, a very effective tool in supporting the match officials on the pitch.\"\n\nHowever, Scholes did also admit: \"We are doing too many checks, we're taking too long in doing them as well. It's to a degree understandable, given the level of scrutiny these guys are under.\n\n\"But the reviews are taking too long and it's affecting the flow of the game and we're extremely aware of that and the need to improve that speed while always maintaining the accuracy.\"\n\nIn Thursday's meeting, PGMOL chief Howard Webb and Scholes will outline six areas in which they will seek to improve upon VAR moving forward this coming season.\n\nNew clubs sworn in: The first point on the agenda at the Premier League meeting is the newly promoted clubs - Leicester City, Ipswich and Southampton - will officially be confirmed as Premier League clubs.\n\nAll three will receive their single share, giving them an equal vote on all matters.\n\nAnchoring to be introduced: Clubs will wave through plans for a new \"anchoring\" system to run in shadow in 2024/25.\n\nThere will be no punishment for any financial breach of this system within this period.

Such decisions should only be overturned in the event that they are \"clearly wrong\", according to the new terminology.\n\nIn other developments, plans to reform the league's equally contro\u00adversial profit and sustainability rules are to be pushed back. \u00adOfficials had expressed their intention to agree new rules this summer, with plans involving an \"anchoring\" scheme at their heart.\n\nThis proposal would involve limits imposed on player\u2011related expenditure, whereby the league's richest clubs could only spend a fixed multiple of the earnings of the division's bottom side.\n\nWhile anchoring was approved in principle by clubs in a vote in April, it has since encountered pushback from the Professional Footballers' Association which fears the move could lead to a de facto salary cap and has hired legal representation to challenge it.\n\nNow the Premier League has stepped back from putting the full range of financial regulations to a confirmatory vote at the AGM and instead will trial anchoring and squad cost ratio measures in shadow form from next season.\n\nLeague sources argue this is an improvement on the previous proposal, giving clubs a chance to assess strengths and weaknesses before a final vote is taken next year.\n\nThe independent tribunal that will hear City's case against the Premier League, whereby the four-in-a-row champions are challenging everything from sponsorship rules to the means by which decisions are taken by the competition, is expected to last two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_macinnes@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Paul MacInnes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_League_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball League (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_general_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annual general meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Footballers' Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Leagues", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8296/4148102_2_articlelarge_SOCCER_20VAR_20_2012423110.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623454", "eventUri": "eng-9623454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

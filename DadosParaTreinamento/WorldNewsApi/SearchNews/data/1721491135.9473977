Prosecutor Yves Bertossa launched a blistering attack on the family at the Swiss city\u2019s criminal court, citing testimony from the staff and Hindujas, as well as evidence submitted during his investigation. \u201cThey spent more for one dog than one of their servants,\u201d he said. The woman, he said, was paid at one point as little as 7 Swiss francs ($11.90) for a working day that lasted as long as 18 hours, seven days a week. He pointed to a budget document headlined \u201cPets,\u201d which he said demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 ($14,589) Swiss francs in a year on their family dog. Staff contracts didn\u2019t specify working hours or days off, but rather that they be available as needed by their employers, Bertossa continued. Given their passports had been confiscated, they had no Swiss francs to spend as their wages were paid in India and couldn\u2019t leave the house without their employer\u2019s permission, they had little to no freedom, he argued.", "summary": "The billionaire Hinduja family is accused of trafficking and exploitation of staff at their Lake Geneva villa.", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/britain-s-richest-family-spent-more-on-pet-dog-than-they-paid-their-servants-court-told-20240618-p5jml5.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.20547147846332944%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_35/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/97442403dfae3af83966697b6e7763a13f35c88e", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:02:23", "author": "Hugo Miller", "authors": ["Hugo Miller"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": -0.54}

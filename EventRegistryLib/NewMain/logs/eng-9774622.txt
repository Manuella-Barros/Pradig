The holder of such a card is allowed to work in Hungary without security clearance and can bring their families to the country. It is valid for two years but can be prolonged.\n\nOfficially, the card holder is not a guest-worker and so does not appear in statistics and different national quotas either.\n\nHungary's visa decision came a year after the United States imposed sanctions on three top officials of the International Investment Bank, a Russian-controlled bank in Budapest: two Russians and a Hungarian.\n\nBank employees had enjoyed full diplomatic immunity and could travel freely in the EU. Under U.S. pressure, Hungary withdrew from the IIB but expressed frustration at having to do so.\n\nThis month Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who took over the six-month EU presidency on July 1, infuriated his EU partners by visiting Moscow to discuss a potential Ukrainian peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOrban has strongly criticised Western military aid to Ukraine.\n\n(Reporting by Boldizsar Gyori and Philip Blenkinsop, additional reporting by Alan Charlish, Benoit van Overstraeten and Andrew Gray; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "source": {"uri":

The policy, said to be designed for seasonal workers under its National Card programme, would allow visitors to enter the country without security checks and enable them to move freely to other EU countries.\n\nThe decision sparked EPP President Weber to send a letter to European Council President Charles Michel on Tuesday to voice his concern about Hungary -- which currently presides over the Council of the European Union until the New Year -- enabling malign actors, including spies, to enter the bloc more easily, according to the FT.\n\nThe \"questionable\" new rules \"create grave loopholes for espionage activities, ... potentially allowing large numbers of Russians to enter Hungary with minimal supervision, posing a serious risk to national security,\" Weber said in his letter.\n\n\"This policy could also make it easier for Russians to move around the Schengen area, bypassing the restrictions required by EU law,\" he added.\n\nRussian citizens are not banned from entering the EU and the border control-free Schengen zone, which also includes non-EU members Norway and Switzerland.\n\nHowever, a series of sanction packages in response to the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, including a ban on Russian-owned airlines operating in EU airspace, made it more difficult for Russian nationals to travel to the bloc.\n\nAt the same time, rules on issuing working permits are a matter of national policy, and each EU member state can decide on its own criteria.\n\nHungary Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has caused significant ire in Brussels and other EU capitals over its pro-Russia stance and increasing overtures toward Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent months.\n\nJust days after taking over the EU presidency on 1 July -- under the slogan \"Make Europe Great Again\", a clear reference to former US President Donald Trump's notorious tagline -- the Hungarian PM went on a series of visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing, which Brussels says were not sanctioned by the bloc.\n\nHis meeting with Putin in Moscow, which Orb\u00e1n dubbed \"Peace Mission 3.0\", caused a diplomatic tempest in European circles and increased calls to strip Hungary of its presidency and voting rights by triggering Article 7 of the EU treaty.\n\nLast Monday, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell delivered a blistering rebukeagainst Orb\u00e1n, stating that his self-described \"peace mission\" went against EU laws and labelling his actions as \"a lack of loyal cooperation\".\n\nOrb\u00e1n's behaviour also triggered a diplomatic spat with neighbouring Poland. On Sunday, Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Teofil Bartoszewski said Hungary should \"join a union with Putin\" after Orb\u00e1n lobbed a series of accusations against Warsaw for its alleged duplicitous actions.\n\n\"The Poles are pursuing the most sanctimonious and the most hypocritical policy in the whole of Europe,\" Orb\u00e1n said in a speech over the weekend. \"They are lecturing us morally and criticising us for our economic relations with Russia, and at the same time, they are doing business with the Russians, buying oil indirectly, and running the Polish economy with it.\"\n\n\"We do not do business with Russia, unlike Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n, who is on the margins of international society -- both in the European Union and NATO,\" Bartoszewski said in his response.\n\nThis is not the first time Orb\u00e1n and the EPP -- of which his ruling party Fidesz was a member -- locked horns. Fidesz quit the EPP group in the European Parliament in March 2021 to prevent its suspension or expulsion.\n\nPrior to that, the EPP party suspended Fidesz's membership in the EU's largest party in March 2019 over its rule-of-law record.\n\nAfter the European elections in June, the Hungarian leader formed his own far-right parliamentary group, Patriots for Europe.\n\nEuronews has reached out to

He said this while speaking in Baile Tusnad, Romania. Since his country became the interim president of the Council of the European Union, the prime minister has emerged as a peacemaker, much to the annoyance and consternation of other member states.\n\nDuring her speech, Orb\u00e1n spoke of a \"weak EU core\", referring to LGBTQ rights and immigration. He compared it to a \"rational and strong\" Russia led by Vladimir Putin, a rising Asia and nation-state east of the EU pursuing an \"independence policy\". For now, Orb\u00e1n says he favors keeping Hungary as a center for nationalist politics in the EU.\n\nOrb\u00e1n has also used Trump's well-known slogan for Europe ('Make Europe Great Again') and openly supports the former US president's candidacy.\n\nThe prime minister often uses his annual address in Romania to announce controversial nationalist policies, often sparking tensions with neighboring countries. This year's speech came at a particular time: Hungary's presidency has been difficult so far. Orb\u00e1n's 'peace trips' were not well received by other EU member states, as he went to them without mandate or permission. In his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, among others, he gave the impression of speaking on behalf of the entire European Union.\n\nOrb\u00e1n often acts contrary to EU policy. For example, he once froze the Union budget, withheld aid to Ukraine and suggested more than once that life would be better outside the EU. But he said in his speech that he did not expect the United States to offer his country an offer that offered better political and economic opportunities than, for example, EU membership. \"But if we get such an opportunity, we have to consider it.\"\n\nAt the same time, the prime minister says it is in China's interest to keep Hungary within the EU. This was evident when President Xi Jinping visited Budapest last May. Since then, Hungary's role as a gateway for Chinese electric car and battery manufacturers to other European markets has strengthened. Hungary is getting a billion euros from Chinese banks this year to finance infrastructure development.\n\nThe money is needed because the country has lost billions in EU funds in recent years by not adhering to the rules. According to Brussels, the Hungarian government is guilty of corruption and collusion.", "source": {"uri": "houstonianonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "houstonianonline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Hungary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Hungary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nation state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774622", "eventUri": "eng-9774622", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Budapest said many would be building a nuclear power plant with Russian technology.\n\nBut Weber said the need for a new immigration system in Hungary was \"questionable\" and warned it could \"create grave loopholes for espionage activities, and potentially allowing large numbers of Russians to enter Hungary with minimal supervision, posing a serious risk to national security\".\n\n\"This policy could also make it easier for Russians to move around the Schengen [borderless] area, bypassing the restrictions required by EU law.\"\n\nThe letter calls for EU leaders \"to adopt the most stringent measures to immediately protect the integrity of the [border-free] Schengen area, limit the security risk that has already arisen and prevent member states from taking similar initiatives in the future\".\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n prompted a backlash from fellow EU leaders earlier this month when he travelled to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin after a stop in Kyiv, allegedly in an attempt to broker peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nWhile Hungary holds the rotating EU presidency until the end the of the year, other leaders were quick in saying Orb\u00e1n did not represent them on his travels. Many countries have since refused to send their ministers to meetings held in Hungary, prompting them to be rescheduled in Brussels.\n\nUnder EU rules, national governments have the power to decide over legal migration and working permits. People from outside the EU who have an EU visa can generally move around freely inside the Schengen area, which covers 29 countries, including Norway and Switzerland.\n\nUnder sanctions introduced since the 2022 war, Russians are not banned from travelling to the EU, though airlines based in Russia are no longer allowed to fly into the bloc and hundreds of people connected to the Kremlin are on individual travel bans and asset-freeze lists.\n\nMichel's spokeswoman said she could not comment until the letter had arrived.\n\nA spokesperson for the Hungarian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe EPP used to be Orb\u00e1n's political family until 2021, when he was forced out over concerns about his increasingly autocratic rule. His Fidesz party, which espouses ultranationalist views, has since teamed up with France's Marine Le Pen and other far-right parties in the EU assembly.\n\nGrowing frustration with Hungary for its pro-Russia stance has also strained relations with its former ally Poland.\n\nAt the weekend Orb\u00e1n hit out at Poland for \"the most sanctimonious and the most hypocritical policy\", claiming it bought Russian oil \"indirectly\".\n\nPolish deputy foreign minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Teofil Bartoszewski rejected the claim. \"I don't really understand why Hungary wants to remain a member of organisations they dislike so much and that supposedly treat them badly,\" he said.\n\n\"Why doesn't [Orb\u00e1n] create a union with Putin and some authoritarian states of that type?\"", "source":

These workers can bring their families and apply for permanent residency after three years.\n\nThis policy starkly contrasts with other EU countries like Finland, which has closed its borders to Russian citizens, citing security concerns.\n\nEU foreign policy expert Sergey Lagodinsky (Greens) criticized the move, telling RND that allowing entry without security checks while Russia is actively trying to weaken Europe through hybrid attacks is misguided. However, he cautioned against generalizing all Russian citizens as potential threats.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by Hungary's ongoing disputes with the EU. Hungary blocked the allocation of over \u20ac6 billion ($6,5 billion) from the European Peace Facility fund for Ukraine's military aid during the EU foreign ministers' meeting on 22 July, despite pressure from most member states to lift the blockade.\n\nIn a sharp diplomatic exchange, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Teofil Bartoszewski suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should leave the EU and form an alliance with Putin.

Instead of building bridges, the Hungarian prime minister used the first days of the Hungarian presidency to provoke European partners by putting his own interests over a European consensus.\n\nAccording to \u017dygimantas Pavilionis, the chair of the Lithuanian Seimas Committee on European Affairs, \"in these turbulent times, when the axis of evil is actively trying to divide Europe, such behaviour by the Hungarian presidency is completely unacceptable\".\n\nHe said that \"all other EU countries and institutions made this very clear to Budapest in this letter and in various other forms\".\n\nOrb\u00e1n's visits to Moscow and Beijing in July provoked an outcry from EU institutions and leaders.

Publicly repeating the war objectives of the Russian president and calling it a 'peace mission' is an unacceptable support of the aggressor,\" the letter reads.\n\nIt also states that the EU must be united against Russia and that the presidency of the Council of the European Union must be constructive and respectful of European treaties.\n\n\"You have our full support demanding the Hungarian government to act according to these basic principles,\" the letter reads.\n\nAccording to the Lithuanian Seimas' statement, the position set out in the letter is also supported by the chair of the

However, Weber has questioned the necessity of such a system, suggesting that it could create \"serious loopholes for espionage activities\" and potentially allow a significant number of Russians to enter Hungary with minimal oversight. This, he warns, poses a considerable threat to national security.\n\nWeber's concerns extend beyond Hungary's borders, cautioning that the policy might enable Russians to bypass EU laws and move more freely within the Schengen Area. The Schengen Zone, comprising 29 countries including non-EU members Norway and Switzerland, generally allows for unrestricted movement among member states once a person is granted entry.\n\nIn his letter, Weber urged EU leaders to take \"the strongest possible measures to immediately protect the integrity of the Schengen Area, mitigate the security risk that has already arisen, and prevent similar initiatives by other member states in the future.\" He stressed the importance of a coordinated EU response to safeguard the region's security framework.\n\nUnder EU regulations, national governments retain the authority to make decisions regarding legal migration and work permits. Individuals from outside the EU holding an EU visa typically enjoy the freedom to travel within the Schengen Zone. However, the implications of Hungary's unilateral action raise questions about the balance between national sovereignty and collective security within the EU.\n\nThis policy shift coincides with Hungary's ongoing collaboration with Russia on the Paks II nuclear power plant project. Signed last November, the agreement outlines the construction timeline for the \u20ac12 billion extension of the Paks nuclear facility.

Following a recent court decision, if the government refuses to pay, the amount owed to Brussels could increase by millions each week.\n\nThe European Commission (EC) issued a letter and a payment notice to the Hungarian government on 16 July, according to spokesman Christian Wiegand, who spoke to N\u00e9pszava. The Commission is requesting that Hungary provide information on how it will implement the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding asylum rules. Additionally, the EC is calling on the government to pay a fine of EUR 200 million within 45 days. This fine was imposed due to the Orb\u00e1n government's refusal to align its asylum regulations with EU policy.\n\nThe issue dates back to 2020 when the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Hungarian asylum and migration laws were incompatible with EU laws. The court identified several issues:\n\nAlthough the government has since closed the transit zones, it has not taken further substantive measures to comply with European Union principles. This represents a serious breach of the EU principle of solidarity, for which the European Commission filed a complaint in February 2022, requesting the court impose a lump sum and a daily fine for failure to comply with the verdict.\n\nOn 13 June this year, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled against Hungary for its failure to comply with the 2020 decision. The court imposed a EUR 200 million fine on Hungary, with an additional penalty of EUR 1 million for each day of delay in compliance. The court stated that the Hungarian government's failure to comply is \"deliberately circumventing the application of a common EU policy as a whole and constitutes an unprecedented and very serious breach of EU law.\"\n\nAs N\u00e9pszava points out, the Hungarian government currently owes Brussels a total of EUR 240 million, which will increase by EUR 1 million every day until Hungarian migration and asylum rules are harmonised with EU law.\n\nThe latest letter from the European Commission only calls on the Orb\u00e1n government to pay the initial lump sum of EUR 200 million within the next 45 days. If it fails to do so, another formal notice will be issued, giving the Hungarian government 15 days to comply. If, after a total of 60 days, the money is not received, Brussels will begin to gradually claim the sums, plus interest, from the EU funds Hungary would otherwise be eligible to receive.\n\nAs N\u00e9pszava recalls, after the June ruling, Viktor Orb\u00e1n described the decision of the Curia as outrageous and unacceptable, stating that Hungary would not give in to the blackmail of Brussels bureaucrats. European Affairs Minister J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka commented, \"We have received the court's verdict and we will examine ways and means of complying with a significant part of the judgment, other than the obligation to pay.

Tensions have been escalating as Hungary, currently holding the EU's rotating presidency, seeks amicable relations with Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine conflict.\n\nRecently, Hungary extended its 'national card' immigration program to Russians and Belarusians, permitting them to work in Hungary without security clearances and bring their families. This decision follows the U.S. sanctions on top officials of a Russian-controlled bank in Budapest and Hungary's subsequent departure from the bank under American pressure. Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose controversial overtures to Moscow have irked EU allies, continues to criticize Western military support to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manfred Weber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Schengen Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of the Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belarusians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/02_07_2024_16_24_32_1700885.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774622", "eventUri": "eng-9774622", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The German politician, who heads the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) family of parties and its parliamentary group in the European Parliament (EP), argued that the measures raised \"serious national security concerns\".\n\nAs we reported earlier, last December, the Hungarian Parliament adopted a proposal for an overhaul of the current rules on the entry and residence of non-EU nationals in Hungary. The government justified the change by saying that the previous legislation, adopted in 2007 needed to be amended because it was adopted before the migration waves. According to them, in case of the old legislation \"the guiding principle was admission, and even in the case of illegality on the part of the foreigner, the primary concern was to guarantee their rights\" rather than \"enforce lawful behavior\".\n\nThe newly adopted legislation introduced the so-called National Card, which entitles the holder to reside in Hungary for a fixed period of more than 90 days within 180 days, but for a maximum of two years, and is valid for a maximum of two years. Among other countries, the document can be issued to citizens of Russia and Belarus if they possess the required qualifications.\n\n\"I don't see why we need to open up the Hungarian labour market to an unspecified number of Russians,\" Russia expert Andr\u00e1s R\u00e1cz told Forbes shortly after the decision. Hungary is part of the Schengen zone which has no internal border controls, meaning that those who enter the country can in principle cross into other member states unhindered (although several EU countries have been circumventing this rule by continuously extending temporary border checks).\n\nAccording to the FT, in his letter, Weber described the new Hungarian system as questionable, saying it \"created grave loopholes for espionage activities and allowed large numbers of Russians to enter Hungary with minimal supervision, posing a serious national security risk\". The new regime \"could also make it easier for Russians to move around the Schengen area, evading\" restrictions in EU law.\n\nIn the letter addressed to Charles Michel, president of the European Council, Weber requested\n\nthat EU leaders \"adopt the most stringent measures to immediately protect the integrity of the [border-free] Schengen area, limit the security risk that has already arisen and prevent member states from taking similar initiatives in the future\".\n\nNeither the Hungarian government nor Michel's spokesperson commented on the letter.\n\nWeber heads the European People's Party, which Fidesz left in 2021 after it was suspended, while KDNP (the smaller party in the Hungarian governing coalition) left in June this year after the Tisza MEPs, including P\u00e9ter Magyar, whose person KDNP finds unacceptable were admitted to the group.", "source": {"uri": "telex.hu", "dataType": "news", "title": "telex"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

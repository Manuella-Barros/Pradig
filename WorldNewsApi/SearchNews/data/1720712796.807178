{"id": 232097430, "title": "George Kurian: Sangh's rare Christian footsoldier becomes Modi's mantri", "text": "KOTTAYAM: George Kurian joined BJP in 1980, a time when in Kerala a minority community person's truck with the saffron party was considered anathema. Undeterred despite being ostracised by even his close relatives, Kurian quickly rose through the ranks of BJP, handling several key responsibilities, but keeping a low profile to such an extent that not many knew such a man existed. June 9, 2024 has changed that. The party has finally acknowledged him with an appropriate reward. Kurian's elevation is also a sign of the BJP's evolution, especially in a pluralistic state like Kerala, where a Hindus-alone strategy could only take it so far. It was crucial to build bridges with the numerically significant and highly influential Christian community and Kurian has for years acted as the bridge between BJP and the church.Interestingly, Kurian is no stranger to Delhi, having been a member of the national organisation committee of BJP from 1999 to 2010. He also pursued his legal profession based in the Supreme Court. He was officer on special duty when O Rajagopal was central minister from '99 to 2004. In 2007, Kurian became general secretary of Minority Morcha and went on to become vice chairman of National Minority Commission while he was vice president of the state unit of the party.He was born to Kurien, hailing from Nambiakulam in Ettumanur, and Annamma in 1960 and was youngest of five children. Most of his education, including law, was in Kottayam district. Kurian's new assignment as central minister has come at a time when he is the state general secretary of the party. He contested from Muvattupuzha and Kottayam parliament constituencies and also against Oommen Chandy from Puthuppally constituency. O T Annamma is his wife and Adarsh (Canada) and Akash (Georgia) are his children.", "summary": "", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/george-kurian-sanghs-rare-christian-footsoldier-becomes-modis-mantri/articleshow/110852107.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-110852220/110852220.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:18:36", "author": "Jaikrishnan Nair", "authors": ["Jaikrishnan Nair"], "language": "en", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": 0.35}

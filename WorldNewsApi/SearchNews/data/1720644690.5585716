Just last month, The Tennessean published an opinion piece by opinion columnist Andrea Williams that likened Clark\u2019s \"marketability\" to that of Elvis Presley\u2019s in the 1950s. The op-ed was revived this week when the Indianapolis Star republished the piece on Thursday. Williams recalls American record producer Sam Phillips saying, \"If I could find a white man who had a Negro sound and a Negro feel, I could make a million dollars.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Phillips signed popular Black artists, like B.B. King, Little Milton and Howlin Wolf, but Williams said he saw his greatest success when he helped launch Presley\u2019s career in 1954. \"\u200b\u200bSam Phillips would go on to record Elvis Presley, a white man who achieved dizzying commercial success by molding his singing and dancing styles to the Black artists, both gospel and secular, who\u2019d shaped the soundtrack of his youth,\" Williams wrote. \"But Elvis\u2019s adoption/appropriation of Blackness is less critical to his stardom than his whiteness. If that wasn\u2019t the case, the Black artists he emulated would\u2019ve reached similar heights themselves. Instead, in America \u2014 a predominantly white society with a very long record of white supremacist ideologies \u2014 whiteness becomes the primary standard by which all is measured and, in business, the primary market to which all products are targeted.\" Williams compared the situation to the Indiana Fever rookie, and claimed that those that have similar conversations are deemed as \"race-baiters.\" \"To be clear: There are others who have addressed the enduring marketability of whiteness. They\u2019ve spoken to the media\u2019s prior refusal to push the WNBA with the same fervor it\u2019s had this year. They\u2019ve also mentioned the fact that, before A\u2019ja Wilson\u2019s recently announced Nike deal, no Black WNBA player has had a signature shoe with a major brand since Candace Parker in 2010-11.\" CHARLES BARKLEY DOUBLES DOWN ON 'PETTY NONSENSE' REGARDING CAITLIN CLARK: 'REALLY BAD PUBLICITY FOR THE WNBA' She later added, \"So instead of learning from this moment and having real-time conversations about the intersection of race, gender, and sports in America, those of who know better end up screaming into an empty, useless void while everyone else holds fast to their unfounded, ahistorical views.\" Just last month, Las Vegas Aces star A\u2019ja Wilson said during an interview with The Associated Press that race was a factor in Clark\u2019s stardom. \"I think it\u2019s a huge thing. I think a lot of people may say it\u2019s not about Black and White, but to me, it is,\" Wilson said. \"It really is because you can be top-notch at what you are as a Black woman, but yet maybe that\u2019s something that people don\u2019t want to see.\" \"They don\u2019t see it as marketable, so it doesn\u2019t matter how hard I work. It doesn\u2019t matter what we all do as Black women, we\u2019re still going to be swept underneath the rug. That\u2019s why it boils my blood when people say it\u2019s not about race, because it is.\" Other notable sports figures have spoken on issue, like Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, who has called out what he said is \"petty nonsense.\" He doubled down on his stance in a recent appearance on OutKick\u2019s \"Don\u2019t @ Me with Dan Dakich.\" \"They act like she didn't earn it. The woman just scored the most points ever by a man or a woman. \u2018She\u2019s only getting this job because she's White.\" Is race a factor? Yes, race is a factor. But her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 speaks for itself. . . . They didn't prop her up just because she's White,\" Barkley said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Others, like LeBron James, have also spoken up about Clark\u2019s success in the league. \"The one thing that I love that she\u2019s bringing to her sport: more people want to watch. More people want to tune in. I saw, for the first time, they had a chartered plane. For the first time in their league history, they flew private. That should be celebrated in its own right,\" he said. \"That should be celebrated, and it's because of Caitlin Clark. Don\u2019t get it twisted. Don\u2019t get it f---ed up. Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things are going to happen for the WNBA.\" For her part, Clark has said that she believes more attention on the league will bring more opportunities to the women\u2019s game. \"It doesn't need to be just one or two players, and I think that even goes back to college. The parity in women's basketball is what's making more people want to come watch it. I think the more we can spread the love, show people, show their talent, show their teams \u2014 that's just going to continue to elevate it,\" she said last month.

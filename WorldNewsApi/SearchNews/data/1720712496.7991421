Little Lexi-Mae Smith is a huge Swiftie but her parents were unable to get tickets for the superstars three-night stay at Murrayfield in Edinburgh - or so she thought. The seven-year-old's parents managed to get a hold of last minute tickets to the Eras Tour show but kept this a secret from their daughter. Dad Garry Elliott and mum Karen Smith, who live in Pollok, told her they could go along to Murrayfield on Friday to listen to the concert from outside the venue. Lexi-Mae's sisters Summer, 15, and Chloe, 14, even did her hair and makeup before they headed off.

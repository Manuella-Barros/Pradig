He hasn\u2019t enjoyed it. \u201cIt\u2019s been terrible. It\u2019s really sucked,\u201d said the Dodgers third baseman, who has been out since May 15 with a strained oblique muscle that was originally considered a mild strain. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of the hardest things that I\u2019ve had to do. I\u2019ve had injuries in the past but nothing that\u2019s kept me out for this long. It\u2019s been a tough one for me. It\u2019s been a very frustrating one for me.\u201d Muncy started to ramp up his activity two weeks after the injury but had a setback and had to shut down his attempts to swing a bat. He has started that process again this past week, hitting off a tee and \u2018flips\u2019 from coaches. He joined the Dodgers in San Francisco for this weekend series in anticipation of taking the next steps \u2013 batting practice in the cage and on the field \u2013 soon. \u201cWith that \u2013 it having been as long as it\u2019s been \u2013 you don\u2019t want to create bad habits when you\u2019re starting to come back. So the biggest thing is to have eyes on me who have seen my swing,\u201d he said, explaining the decision to join the team rather than go to the training complex in Arizona. \u201cThere are certain things in my swing that are so fickle that if they get off it\u2019s really hard to come back from. So right from the get-go we\u2019re just trying to make sure I\u2019m doing those things right.\u201d Muncy was moved to the 60-day injured list and won\u2019t be eligible to be activated until after the All-Star break. \u201cIn an ideal world,\u201d he said, he would start a minor-league injury rehabilitation assignment before then. \u201cThat\u2019s where it\u2019s going to be contingent on how he is progressing,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cWhether he goes out before and gets the four days off like everyone else does, or if it doesn\u2019t go as quickly, then take the break and then go out on rehab afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s open-ended. We\u2019ll see how he progresses. We\u2019ve already had one setback, we don\u2019t need another.\u201d JAVY THE HERO Javier Herrera handled the foul ball off Kik\u00e9 Hernandez\u2019s bat during Wednesday\u2019s game in Chicago with fewer nerves than he did being asked to talk to reporters about it Friday afternoon. \u201cI was just doing my job,\u201d said Herrera, blushing at the attention from the media \u2013 and the players and fellow staff members who surrounded the group with phones out. Herrera\u2019s quick-handed save went viral Wednesday. The video showed him standing on the top step of the dugout and calmly snagging a foul ball that seemed to be headed for Shohei Ohtani, standing behind him. Give that kid a raise. He just saved Shohei Ohtani\u2019s life. pic.twitter.com/WTrYr1FdmW \u2014 Ben Verlander (@BenVerlander) June 27, 2024 \u201cI saw the pitch all the way through, hit the bat and the ball pretty much found me,\u201d he said Friday. \u201c(Ohtani) said thank you. And I said, \u2018I told you, I have your back.\u2019\u201d Ohtani posted video from Herrera\u2019s brief media session on Instagram with the caption \u201cMy Hero.\u201d Herrera said he got \u201cabout 80\u201d text messages after the video started to make the rounds. \u201cSomeone sent me the video and I saw it 100 times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was pretty impressive. I was impressed. But in the moment, it was just like \u2018Okay, let\u2019s keep playing.\u2019\u201d The 38-year-old Herrera has been a part of the Dodgers\u2019 clubhouse staff for 18 years and this isn\u2019t his first brush with celebrity thanks to a foul ball. Working the left field line during a game in August 2016, he tumbled head first over the wall and into the stands while chasing a foul fly. It went better this time. \u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI fell on my \u2013 I fell. I fell (the other time) and I\u2019m the hero on this one, I guess. The other one I was more of a joke. It was more embarrassing.\u201d UP NEXT Dodgers (RHP Tyler Glasnow, 8-5, 2.88 ERA) at Giants (TBA), Saturday, 4:15 p.m., FOX (Ch. 11), 570 AM", "summary": "Muncy is not eligible to return from his oblique injury until after the All-Star break, but he joined the team in San Francisco to start \u201cramping up\u201d his activity.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/28/dodgers-max-muncy-increasing-activity-in-anticipation-of-2nd-half-return/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/imageedit_3_2679176846.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:55:17", "author": "Bill Plunkett", "authors": ["Bill Plunkett"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.226}

According to a survey by Adecco Group Japan, around 70% of employees in their 20s and 30s consider their workplaces to be 'white companies,' known for good working conditions. However, over 40% of these respondents also view their companies as 'yuru-black,' and nearly 40% of those are considering changing jobs within the next year. About 60% of young employees believe that their current workplaces do not offer career development opportunities. This suggests that young workers are seeking more than just comfort; they want jobs that provide a sense of purpose and opportunities for growth.

address them.\n\n\"It is also on record that other prominent APC senators had expressed similar views on the floor of the Senate and equally called on President Tinubu to take urgent measures to avert the seeming imminent food crisis.\"\n\nThe group maintained that Ndume was a dedicated APC member \"who laboured tirelessly from its formative stage to its present position and has never done anything that undermined the success of the party or its leadership, but rather offered constructive advice on good governance for the wellbeing of Nigerians.\"\n\nIt said rather than removing Ndume as the Senate Chief Whip, \"the Senate could have done better by deploying its internal democratic mechanism of resolving issues affecting its members.\"\n\n\"We pray that the Senate will not throw away the baby with the bath water over an issue that could amicably be resolved.\n\n\"In light of these facts and the need to give our senatorial district its due position in the leadership of the Senate, we humbly appeal to the Senate to reconsider its position on the measures taken against Senator Ndume in the interest of fairness, justice and equity and reinstate him accordingly.\n\n\"Additionally, we

We pray that the Senate will not throw away the bath water with the baby over an issue that could amicably be resolved.\n\n\"In light of these facts and the need to give our Senatorial District its due position in the leadership of the Senate, we humbly appeal to the Senate to reconsider its position on the measures taken against Senator Ndume in the interest of fairness, justice, and equity and reinstate him accordingly.\n\n\"Additionally, we urge President Ahmed Bola Tinubu, GCFR, the leader of our great party, a true democrat who upholds the tenets of democracy to passionately intervene.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesourceng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Source Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akinwale_kasali@thesourceng.com", "name": "Akinwale Kasali", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ndume", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ndume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ali_Ndume", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Ali Ndume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biu,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biu, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Biu, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monguno", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monguno"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monguno"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godswill_Akpabio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Godswill Akpabio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Federal_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Order of the Federal Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Older_Citizens", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Older Citizens", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://thesourceng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Senator-Ndume-Constituency-Protest.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758430", "eventUri": "eng-9758430", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

It is in the light of this perception that Sunday Aborisade chronicles Ndume's turbulent political sojourn in the Red Chamber of the National Assembly.\n\nIn one fell swoop last Wednesday, the leadership of the All Progressives Congress, announced the sacking of the Senator representing the Borno South Senatorial District, Ali Ndume, as the Chief Whip of the Senate and his immediate replacement with another Senator from Borno North, Tahir Mongunu.\n\nThe APC in a letter to the leadership of the Red Chamber led by Senator Godswill Akpabio, was not done with the vocal lawmaker yet, it also demanded the resignation of the vocal lawmaker from the party he is a founding member.\n\nThe request was contained in a letter signed by the National Chairman of the party, Alhaji Umar Ganduje and the National Secretary, Senator Bashir Ajibola.\n\nAkpabio subjected the request to voice votes at plenary and was affirmed by majority of the APC senators.\n\nThe development may not be unconnected with the alleged anti-President Bola Tinubu's comments made by Ndume penultimate week in an interview with journalists.\n\nHe had alleged that the President had been caged at the Villa and that he was not aware of the acute hunger being experienced by Nigerians.\n\nNdume suffered similar fate in January 2017 when he was removed as Leader of the 8th Senate.\n\nThe APC National Working Committee (NWC) in its letter alleged that Ndume seriously abused his office through unguarded utterances and outbursts against the Federal Government of Nigeria and President Bola Tinubu in particular.\n\nThe party's NWC further alleged that Ndume was more of a mole in the party and advised him to honourably resign his membership.\n\nThe letter read in part: \"We write on behalf of the National Working Committee of our great party to express our displeasure, our outrage and our deep disappointment at the unbecoming, unfounded and baseless criticism of the government and the party, the APC, by the majority whip of the Senate, Senator Ali Ndume.\n\n\"As a member of the ruling party, we expected a much more responsible and decorous behaviour from him. But this has not been the case.\n\n\"His uncouth and rabid outbursts against the government, before the international and global community is not only harmful to the government's image alone but also undermines the party's unity and cohesion and in addition, undermines the government's effort to bring in foreign direct investments to Nigeria.\n\n\"As he is a ranking member of our party, his actions are unbecoming of a senior member of the Senate and sets a very poor example for others in future to follow.\n\n\"His latest tirade on air, during a programme on Arise Television where he referred to the government of Bola Tinubu, commander-in-chief as being run by thieves, portrays Ali Ndume as a person who is bent on running the country down and running the party aground through incitements and cheap propaganda.\n\n\"We have reviewed that Senator Ali Ndume should honourably resign the membership of APC and join any opposition party of his choice formally instead of hiding behind the veil of crass activism to decimate the hard earned cohesion and goodwill that our party, the APC, is enjoying within and outside the country.\n\n\"His utterances which are sheer propaganda, which are not based on verifiable facts, are unbecoming of a member of the APC caucus of the Senate of the National Assembly.\n\n\"It therefore behoves on the APC caucus to bring this to the attention of its members for necessary actions to curtail his deliberate mission to undermine the government and the party and the progress of Nigerians particularly those appointed by Mr President to work against his administration.\n\n\"We therefore urge the Senate caucus to take appropriate steps to address this issue and ensure that members of the Senate, particularly those within the All Progressives Congress, hold and maintain decorum in their public utterances.\n\n\"Accordingly, we realise that the position of the whip of the senate belongs to our party and we are not opposed to whatever position the members of the APC caucus in the senate may have, but we are of the opinion that Distinguished Senator Mohammed Tahir Monguno should immediately replace distinguished Senator Ali Ndume who is bent on bringing down the country as the majority whip of the Senate\".\n\nConsequently the President of the Senate after reading the letter, put the NWC request to voice votes among the APC Senators which they all accepted.\n\nApart from removing Ndume as Whip of the Senate, his Deputy Chairmanship position of Senate Committee on Appropriation, was also taking away from him and was instead, made the Chairman of Committee on Tourism.\n\nMonguno who replaced Ndume as Chief Whip, also replaced him as Deputy Chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe Senate however gave Ndume a soft landing when Senator Cyril Fasuyi (APC Ekiti North) moved a motion that Ndume should face a disciplinary action before the Senate Committee on Code of Conducts, Ethics and Privileges on allegation of kleptomania against his fellow senators.\n\nIn an apparent move to save Ndume from suspension, the President of the Senate in his remarks on Fasuyi's motion, said since the APC NWC had requested for his removal as Whip and approved, he should be forgiven for now.\n\nNdume was not in the chamber on Wednesday when the big stick was wielded against him because he had to travel to Borno State to mourn a dead relative.\n\nHe nevertheless broke his silence on his travails on Friday when he spoke with journalists in Maiduguri, shortly before the Jumaat service.\n\nNdume said having reviewed the conversation that prompted his ouster, his action did not warrant his sack.\n\nThe unrepentant ranking Senator said he had also declined the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Tourism, arguing that he lacked the experience and exposure to lead such a sensitive panel.\n\nNdume said that he never wanted to be Senate Whip after serving as the leader in the Eight Senate.\n\nThe lawmaker said he was given the chance to choose which committee to serve as the vice chairman having successfully led the campaigns that brought about the emergence of Akpabio as President of the Senate.\n\nOn the call on him to resign from the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Senator said he was a founding member of the party.\n\nAccording to him, he was one of the 22 Senators from the PDP that formed the APC when the current National Chairman of the party, Abdullahi Ganduje, was a deputy governor in Kano State.\n\nHe, however, stated that when former President Muhammadu Buhari in company of President Tinubu ordered him to sign a document to join APC at the Imo House in Abuja, he informed his people before going public.\n\nNdume said he would consult his people before deciding on whether to leave the APC or not. His words: \"I could not speak up immediately after my removal as the Chief Whip because I was mourning the death of a family member.\"\n\nThe sack of Ndume as Senate principal officer generated serious controversy last week as most of the public commentators, highly respected opinion leaders and foremost rights activists, condemned the actions of the APC leadership and it's representatives in the Senate.\n\nThe two main opposition political parties in the country, the Peoples Democratic Party and the Labour Party strongly condemned the actions taken by the APC and the Senate against Ndume just for expressing his opinion on matters affecting the masses of the country.\n\nFor instance, the leadership of the Labour Party, in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Obiora Ifoh, said Ndume's removal clearly indicated that speaking truth to power is now a crime in Nigeria.\n\nLP described as uncalled for the alleged humiliation of Ndume by the Senate and the APC portrayed dictatorial inclination.\n\nPart of the statement read, \"The crime of Senator Ndume was his bold expression of his concerns regarding the escalating cost of living and food scarcity in Nigeria, and his revelation that President Tinubu has chosen to play the ostrich even in the face of acute starvation being witnessed in Nigeria.\n\n\"The dimension this administration is taking is grave. Few months ago, Senator Abdul Ningi exposed the rot in the government where the Senate leadership and the executive collaborators allegedly padded the budget.\n\n\"That got him suspended and intimidated out of his lawful representative role as a Senator.\n\n\"It is needless talking about the economic crisis on going in Nigeria even where a few cabal are massively enriching themselves. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) recently said that food inflation has risen to 40.66 percent.\n\n\"Even with all these glaring and scaring challenges, the government is said to have paid about N150 billion for a presidential jet, building roads that have no direct bearing with the economic crises in Nigeria.\"\n\nThe LP wondered what can be called democratic about the ruling party in making decision for an independent legislative arm on who takes up leadership role in the nation's legislature.\n\n\"This is clear a tyranny of a cabal against the legislative autonomy. Nigeria is gradually descending into dictatorship and we are calling on the citizens to be on alert and put up a defence against the starvation weapon being deployed by this administration,\" it added.\n\nSimilarly, the 2023 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, said the Tinubu's administration, with the sacking of Ndume, has turned the National Assembly, especially the Senate into a 'puppet'.\n\nAtiku condemned the action, in a statement via his Official X handle saying members of the Senate should not be reprimanded for performing their statutory duty of calling the executive to order.\n\nAccording to him, \"the legislative arm of government was conceived as a means of protecting the people from the authoritarian tendencies of wielders of state powers, making sure that the executive does not go overboard in the application of its powers\".\n\nAtiku alleged that the current administration of President Tinubu has become an anathema to the general principle of democracy as providing primary protection for the people against executive excesses.\n\nNdume had suffered and survived many trails as a politician seeking the best for Nigerians, especially his constituents.\n\nHe had in the past been remanded in the National Correctional Service, Kuje in FCT on the order of Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court. This was as a result of his standing as surety for one of his constituents, Abdulrasheed Maina, the former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), who failed to appear in court over the alleged N2 Billion Pension Funds Fraud. Ndume had helped Maina secure bail by providing the bail requirements. The bail requirements included the sum of N500 million bail bonds and two sureties on the same amount. One of the sureties must be a serving Senator who must not be facing any criminal charge. The Senator must also own landed properties in highbrow Asokoro and Maitama.\n\nMaina was arraigned alongside his son on a 12-count charge of money laundering, concealment of proceeds of an unlawful act. Maina was accused of using his sister-in-law, Mairo Mohammed Bashir, a UBA staff, to open a corporate account without due diligence, in the name of Common Input Properties and Investments Limited.\n\nThe former chairman of PRTT was also accused of siphoning pension monies to the sum of N171.9m in cash and has been reported to have made $316, 588.27, and $314.6m from unlawful transactions between 2014 to 2018.\n\nThe Court's ruling was received by many with rude shock with Ndume as an outspoken Senator who often rattles, disrupts and questions government agenda even though he belonged to the same party.\n\nNdume had addressed issues concerning the Boko Haram insurgency with urgency because of the threat it posed to the well-being of the people in his constituency.\n\nNdume has served in both the Green and Red Chambers of the National Assembly. He had represented Chibok, Damboa and Gwoza federal constituency in the House of Representatives from 2003 to 2011, as a member of the ANPP. He was the minority leader after his re-election to the House of Representatives in 2011.\n\nHe won a seat at the Senate in 2015 with an APC ticket and emerged majority leader against the wishes of the party. After serving as majority leader for eight months, he was unceremoniously removed. Ndume returned to the Senate in 2019. He emerged once again as majority leader only for 19 months. During his majority leadership stint, he was mot allowed to preside as Chairman of any committee until he was ousted.\n\nHe was however the deputy chairman, committee of Rules and Business; member, committee on Aviation; member, committee on Foreign Affairs and member, committee on Public Procurement.\n\nNdume has sponsored numerous bills among which are the North East Development Commission Bill, and the Nigerian Peace Corps Bill which raised national concerns and got rejected by President Buhari. Ndume was suspended during the 8th Senate.\n\nHe had once been punished for some of his controversial statements concerning the Boko Haram insurgency and this deprived his constituents of representations for eight months.\n\nHe was also heavily criticised and eventually sacked by the APC caucus for allegedly blocking the appointment of Mr. Ibrahim Magu, as substantive EFCC chairman that was later arrested for alleged bribery and other financial crimes in 2019.\n\nWhen Ndume was in the PDP, he was not in the good books of Senator Bukola Saraki and Senator Dino Melaye, and these also led to a six-month suspension, as well as ruffled arguments on the floor of the Senate.\n\nNdume ran for the President of Senate in the 9th Assembly but he was not favoured to assume the coveted office. He was defeated by Senator Ahmad Lawan.\n\nHe was in November 2011, linked to Boko Haram. Those who know Ndume very well suspected foul play. Ndume is a devout Muslim and comes from a multi religious background and could not have been a party to such allegations.\n\nThough a Moslem, his mother and some of his siblings are Christians, so Ndume could not be sponsoring a radical group that delights in terminating lives and destroying property.\n\nMany discerning Nigerians saw the hands of his detractors in the charges that were levelled against him. This was indeed a low point in the promising and flourishing political career of a bourgeoning leader. This did not however deter him neither did his teeming supporters abandon him.\n\nNdume kept the flag flying with his constituents providing the necessary support. And since it is often said that no matter how long you suppress truth, it will always manifest, Ndume again triumphed over falsehood.\n\nThe truth manifested itself when the so- called Boko Haram spokesman that implicated Ndume and who had served out his three-year jail term, confessed his lies and begged for forgiveness.", "source": {"uri": "allafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Ndume as Senate Chief Whip  --  National Accord Newspaper", "body": "A Pro-Ndume Group, Southern Borno Concerned Citizens has appealed to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and APC National Chairman, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje to reconsider the decision of removing Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume from his position as Senate Chief Whip.\n\nThe group also urged President Tinubu and APC National Chairman to review the decision of the party to withdraw his APC Membership as communicated to the upper chamber of the National Assembly on July 17, 2024.\n\nThe National President of the Southern Borno Concerned Citizens, Comrade Bulama Sawa Ali stated this on Tuesday while briefing journalists at the NUJ Press Center Maiduguri\n\nHe said: \"It has come to our attention that certain individuals have attempted to tarnish Sen.Ndume's political credibility, especially since he decided to speak on behalf of the concerned citizens of Nigeria.\n\n\"This is not acceptable as far as Unity is concerned. The action taken against Senator Ndume is not just an offense to him personally, but it also serves as a warning to all who dare to speak the truth and represent their constituents faithfully at the National Assembly.\n\n\"Your Excellency Sir, we, the entire youth of Southern Borno and Borno State in general, believe that Sen. Ndume is a very democratic, competent, composed, confident, eloquent, and highly intellectual politician with vast experience in governance.\n\n\"He was elected as the six-term Representative of Southern Borno Constituency at the National Assembly, and we stand behind him at this trying moment.\n\n\"By this press conference, we pass the following vote of confidence in Dist. Sen. Ndume and tender a specific request to His Excellency Bola Ahmad Tinubu (Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces) and the APC National Working Committee under the leadership of HE Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the APC National Chairman.\n\nThe leader of the group added that ,\"We, the youth of Southern Borno and Borno State, stand united in extending our vote of confidence in Sen. ,Muh'd Ali Ndume.\"\n\n\"As you are all aware, we are here on behalf of the youth clubs and associations in Borno State to address this press conference and make a call to the APC National Working Committee, under the leadership of His Excellency Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, APC National Chairman, to reconsider his decision concerning the removal of Dist. Sen. Muh'd Ali Ndume from the position of Chief Whip and the withdrawal of his APC membership, as communicated to the National Assembly on July 17, 2024.\n\n\"Your Excellency, sir, you have not only honored the Senator but also the entire youth and citizens of Borno State. We are very proud of you as our President.\n\n\"Your Excellency Sir, we are appealing to you to review the interview that led to his removal from the position of Majority Chief Whip. Sen. Ndume has done more than enough good for society and the people of Southern Borno and Borno State.\n\n\"As a politician and lecturer, he has mentored thousands of us when he was serving as a lecturer at Ramat Polytechnic Maiduguri. It's significant to note that in his capacity, he has supported countless youths in pursuing their educational goals both within and outside the country.\n\n\" Your Excellency Sir, Sen. Ndume has worked with various stakeholders across different schools, colleges, polytechnics, and universities, ensuring that the sons and daughters of the less privileged in our society get educated and liberated from illiteracy and poverty., Bulama said\n\nAccording to him,\" As the saying goes, \"educate one and you educate the society.\" His achievements and track record can be confirmed by the concerned citizens.\n\n\"Let me state for intelligibility, Sen. Ndume has never been reported by any Southern Borno Concerned Citizens or political party in Borno State. Sen. Ndume is one of the founding members of the APC in the Senate, and calling for his withdrawal of membership from the party is unacceptable.\n\n\"This action not only disrespects his contributions but also signifies the withdrawal of all Southern Borno citizens from the party. I want to categorically state that the APC has deliberately replaced Senator Muh'd Ali Ndume, Senator Representing Borno South with Senator Mohammed Tahir Monguno, Representing Borno North at the 10 the Assembly to cause hesitation, puzzlement, confusion and disunity within the APC in Borno State.\n\n\"You will all recall that on July 12, 2024, Sen. Ndume was interviewed on Arise TV regarding the hardships faced by Nigerian citizens, limited access to President Bola Ahmad Tinubu (C-in-C), and recent government policies.\n\n\"Firstly, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to His Excellency Bola Ahmad Tinubu (C-in-C) for recognizing the capacity and worth of Sen. Ndume by enlisting him among the ranking senators as the Majority Chief Whip at the 10th the Assembly.\n\n\"Finally, we, the youth of Southern Borno and Borno State, restate our unified vote of confidence in Sen. Ndume and pledge our full support to him.\n\n\"We trust that His Excellency, Bola Ahmad Tinubu (C-in-C), through his wisdom and as he always listens to the concerns of the youth, will take our request into consideration and make a decision that reflects the determination and welfare of the youth and the people of Borno State,\" the group leader said.", "source": {"uri": "nationalaccordnewspaper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Accord Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ali_Ndume", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Ali Ndume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullahi_Umar_Ganduje", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abdullahi Umar Ganduje"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Whip", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief Whip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiduguri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maiduguri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maiduguri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monguno", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monguno"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monguno"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Older_Citizens", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Older Citizens", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.nationalaccordnewspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG-20240723-WA0013.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758430", "eventUri": "eng-9758430", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 454, "textEnd": 461, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 4381, "textEnd": 4388}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Blasts Akpabio", "body": "Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, has slammed the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, over the treatment meted out on Senator representing Borno South, Ali Ndume.\n\nNaija News recalls that Ndume was sacked as the chief whip last Wednesday and was immediately replaced by the Senator representing Borno North, Tahir Monguno, over his criticism of Tinubu's administration.\n\nHis replacement by the Senate followed a directive issued in a letter written by the National Chairman of the party, Umar Ganduje and National Secretary, Senator Bashir Ajibola.\n\nThe request was put to voice votes by Akpabio on the floor of the Senate and loudly affirmed by all the APC senators.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists on Wednesday, Eze, erstwhile National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New People's Democratic Party (nPDP), said the action of the Akpabio-led Senate and the National Working Committee (NWC) amounts to waging a political vendetta against Ndume.\n\nAccording to the APC chieftain, Ndume's ordeal was undeserving, stressing that Akpabio had become a puppet who is resentful about punishing anyone who speaks the truth about President Bola Tinubu's Government.\n\nEze further commended Ndume for his boldness and urged him to \"remain undaunted and in high spirits,\" assuring him that \"Nigerians have seen the sincerity of his heart and are solidly behind him at this trying moment as the country continues to grapple with poverty, hyperinflation, and hunger, which are the notable legacies of the Tinubu administration.\"\n\nThe statement added, \"Ndume's removal as Senate Chief Whip marks a watershed in the brewing tension in the country perpetuated by the gamut of policy summersaults and general instability of the Tinubu regime, validating thoughts that the administration is clueless and grossly overwhelmed by the problems it has created for the country.\n\n\"Aside from belonging to the class of chieftains who risked life and fortunes to build the APC from the very foundation, Ndume has been vocal on issues of national concern, which is the fulcrum around which his status as a lawmaker revolves.\n\n\"As a party that prides itself as a bastion of hope for Nigeria and Nigerians, one would have loved to see the APC leverage Ndume's revelation to set in motion efforts that would help the Tinubu regime navigate itself out of the mess it has made of the entire system rather than strip him of his position in the Senate.", "source":

But at the close of work that day, he had reverted to a floor member of the Senate. He oozed power as a close confidant of the then president of the Senate, Bukola Saraki. He had got the position in appreciation of his loyalty to the 'Like Minds Senators' who stood by Senator Saraki in the tortuous journey to attaining the Senate Presidency on June 9, 2015. The Like Minds Senators, the group led by Saraki, of which Ndume was a leading member, had staged a 'coup de grace' against the hierarchy of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its core loyalists in the Senate named the Senate Unity Forum (SUF) in the struggle for the control of the 8th Senate.\n\nSaraki, backed by the Like Minds Senators, had mounted a spirited campaign for the Senate presidency against the wishes of the leadership of the ruling APC, which was in favour of Senator Ahmad Lawan. Ndume got the juicy position of Senate Leader in appreciation of his resolute support for Saraki, who had outsmarted leaders of his party to nick the Senate presidency in June 2015. Every odd had been staked against a Saraki Senate presidency by the APC ahead of the convocation of the Senate that year. But Ndume and the Like Minds bonded together and delivered the fatal blow that made Saraki the Senate President on June 9, 2015.\n\nSaraki, in the eyes of the APC, committed further fouls by making Ndume Senate Leader. The party had, in trying to come to terms with its defeat by Saraki's Like Minds Senators, named Senator Ahmad Lawal as the preferred Senate leader. The communication was, however, ignored by Saraki, who announced that a majority of the APC lawmakers in the chamber had earlier communicated their preference for Ndume as Senate leader.\n\nSo, from June 2015 till late December 2016, Ndume and Saraki enjoyed a chubby relationship. Ndume called the shots as the leader of Senate's business. He was the official number three man, who had the ears of the presiding officer. The minds were seen to be working alike until the bubble burst in January 2017. That was when Ndume, in trying to play the role of the political leader of Borno State decided to side with the then acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu. President Muhammadu Buhari had presented Magu to the Senate for confirmation but the nomination was rejected. The president repeated the nomination months after, claiming that he had investigated the issues that knocked the nominee out in the first instance. But the Senate came to the same conclusion it reached earlier after it received adverse security reports on the candidate from the Department of State Services. Senators went into closed session and deliberated on the matter. They, in fact, concluded that Magu should be denied confirmation.\n\nBut Ndume chose to differ with his clan. Probably forgetting that the Senate is a club and that you either belong to the club or you are out of it, he visited the Presidential Villa and granted an interview denying the rejection of Magu by the Senate chamber. The chamber saw his interview as not just washing the dirty linen in the open but wrestling with the same class that had protected him against the claws of the APC and the presidency.\n\nSo, on January 10, 2017, the APC caucus in the Senate submitted a letter to the president of the Senate to indicate the removal of Ndume as Senate Leader. The decision paved the way for Dr Ahmad Lawan to assume the position, something that bodes well with the thinking of the leadership of the APC. Ndume, however, expressed shock at the decision, declaring that his colleagues removed him without an opportunity to defend himself. But the matter did not end there, Ndume was to suffer a six month suspension following a motion he moved on the floor of the Senate which was considered speculative and an affront on the privileges of the Senators.\n\nHe spoke in an interview about his removal and suspension thus: \"My colleagues signed for my removal as the leader but none of them confronted me with any allegation. I was suspended without being allowed to defend myself on any allegation. The only thing that I did was that I called the attention of the Senate, coming under Order 14 and 15, which has to do with individual privilege, to the issues in the public domain which touched on the integrity of the Senate that should be investigated.\n\n\"One of them was an allegation that the Senate was on vengeance mission against the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service because he impounded the bullet-proof cars allegedly imported by a principal officer of the Senate. The second issue was that of Senator Dino Melaye's educational qualification. Both issues were widely published by print and electronic media.\"\n\nNdume said his travails stemmed from his insistence that the Senate stick to its standard procedures and practice and that Magu should have been presented to the floor for a confirmation hearing, after which he would have been rejected.\n\n\"In the case of Magu, that was not done. We only had a closed-door session and when we emerged the Senate spokesperson claimed that he had been rejected. I had to set the record straight by saying we never rejected the nominee. This is because you don't accept or reject a nominee at a closed session,\" he added.\n\nHowever, after serving out his suspension, Ndume was able to overcome his challenges in the 8th Senate to return to the chamber in the 9th and the current 10th Senate. In the process leading to the election of the principal officers of the 10th Senate, Ndume, like it happened in 2015, sided with the winning candidate. He was on the side of Senator Godswill Akpabio, just as he backed Saraki in the 8th Senate. Akpabio won the election and rewarded Ndume with the position of Senate Chief Whip and Vice Chairman, Committee on Appropriation.\n\nNine years after his ordeal, which earned him a suspension from the Senate in 2015, Ndume again faced another round of fire from his colleagues in the 10th Assembly. The Borno senator had stoked the fire and earned the ire of his colleagues on Wednesday, July 10, when he told newsmen that President Bola Tinubu had been caged in the Presidential Villa. He said that the president was not in touch with the happenings in the polity and was doing nothing to mitigate the security crisis and food security challenges facing Nigerians. He said that Nigerians were angry with the president over his \"failure\" to tackle the challenges of poverty, insecurity, hunger, among others.\n\nNdume had said: \"Mr. President is not in the picture of what is happening outside the Villa. He has been fenced off and caged. So, many of us won't go through the backdoor to engage him. Now they have stopped him from talking and he doesn't have public affairs managers, except that his spokesman, Ajuri Ngelale, who writes press statements. Nigerians are getting very angry.\n\n\"The government is not doing anything about the food scarcity and it needs to do something urgently. We don't have food reserve. There is unavailability of food. Food crisis is the worst crisis that any nation can encounter. If we add that to security crisis, it will be severe.\n\n\"The president should wake up; it seems he isn't in the picture of what is happening because he has been caged off. He has been fenced off by plutocrats. He should open his doors and meet those who will tell him the truth. Unfortunately, the people who will tell him the truth won't struggle to meet him. I am very worried not only for the president himself but myself.\"\n\nHe said in another interview that even ministers were finding it hard to access the president. He added: \"The major problem with this government is that its doors are closed, to the extent that even some ministers cannot see the President, not to mention members of the National Assembly, who do not have the opportunity to meet with him and discuss the issues affecting their constituencies.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Ndume, he had taken over the role the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had abdicated in the last one year. Miffed by what it considered a poke from a toxic finger, the APC replied Ndume with bared fangs. By Wednesday, July 18, the Senate chamber was in receipt of a letter from the national chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Ganduje, and the national secretary, Senator Bashir Ajibola, which requested the removal of the Borno senator for making \"hurtful\" statements. The party equally advised Ndume to feel free to leave the ruling party and join any of the opposition parties\n\nThe party wrote: \"You have been making uncouth and rabid outbursts against the government before the international community which is not only harmful to the government's image but its effort to bring in Foreign Direct Investments. We are of the opinion that Mohammed Tahir Monguno should immediately replace Senator Ali Ndume who is bent on bringing down the country as the majority whip of the Senate.\"\n\nAkpabio immediately went to work against his ally and effected his replacement with a fellow Borno Senator, Monguno. Ndume was also stripped of his role as vice chairman, Committee on Appropriation and moved to the Committee on Tourism, a position he has since rejected.\n\nNotwithstanding the retaliatory attack on him by the APC hierarchy, Ndume appeared unruffled. He told newsmen days after his sack that he would continue to speak out against government.\n\nHe said: \"I am a democrat and a realist, and someone who always says the truth no matter whose Ox is gored. According to former US President, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt: \"Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise, he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.\"\n\nIt appears clear that despite the punishment inflicted on the voluble Borno Senator, the last has not been heard from him as far as the affairs of the 10th Senate are concerned.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Anyway, it is their internal problem or whatever they decide to call it.\"\n\nThe NNPP's criticism is coming in the wake of a similar condemnation by the leadership of the Labour Party.\n\nEarlier, the National Publicity Secretary of LP, Obiora Ifoh, also voiced concerns that the APC government is fast becoming intolerant of the same system that brought it into power.\n\nIfoh stated that with Ndume's removal as chief whip, speaking truth to power is gradually becoming a crime in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the humiliation of Ndume by the Goodwill Akpabio's led Senate has portrayed the dictatorial inclination of the APC.\n\nThe ruling APC, however, disagreed with the notions of the two opposition parties.\n\nIn an exclusive phone chat with our correspondent, Deputy National Organising Secretary of the APC, Nze Chidi Duru said many people seemed to miss the point of why Ndume was removed.\n\nHe said, \"The reality is that there was a concern whether as chief whip, he did not have access to the leadership of the country and the leadership of the party. We are unaware that he was denied the opportunity to meet with Mr President. He should be in a position to enjoy such liberty.\n\n\"It is only on that account if he had said that he is not enjoying that privilege, that it could be something to put on the table. But a blanket statement of him saying Mr President has become insular may be what informed the position of Senate to remove him from his position as chief whip of the party.\"\n\nContinuing, Duru disclosed that the fear that the APC government is beginning to wear a toga of a dictator is unfounded.\n\nThis was even as he maintained that the ruling party would always welcome constructive criticism from the opposition and aggrieved members of the public.\n\n\"We welcome every view, whether positive or contrary. It is the beauty of democracy. Parties must be allowed to ventilate their views and people must again be allowed to express their opinion on any matter, so long as it coheres to party discipline, and members interaction and ensuring that it does not disturb the cohesion within the party.\n\n\"As for the Labour Party and NNPP releasing statements, it is what an opposition should do. I am happy they are doing what they should do as an opposition party. If other parties release a statement in that account, again, it is what they should do as the opposition.\n\n\"But we are confident that as APC, given the fact that we took over power from a party that was in government in 2015, we would never do anything that would suggest a stifling of alternative views and constructive criticisms in Nigeria. We are noted for being a party that allows all shades of opinion to bloom and be canvassed.\"", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adebayo_folorunsho_francis@punchng.com", "name": "Adebayo Folorunsho-Francis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Nigeria_People's_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Nigeria People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ndume", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ndume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Whip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Whip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godswill_Akpabio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godswill Akpabio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monguno", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monguno"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monguno"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullahi_Umar_Ganduje", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abdullahi Umar Ganduje"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Nigeria)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_discipline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party discipline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/08180742/Senator-Mohammed-Ali-Ndume.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758430", "eventUri": "eng-9758430", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

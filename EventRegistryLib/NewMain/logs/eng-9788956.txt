In 78 games, he was hitting .300 with a .347 on-base percentage and .417 slugging percentage. An electric baserunner, he was successful on 24-of-31 stolen-base attempts this season.\n\nRengifo had been trending up prior to July, when a right wrist injury slowed his progress. Rengifo missed 15 games with the injury, returned from the injured list to play nine games, and went 6-for-32 (.188) with only one extra-base hit upon his return.\n\nStill, there was enough buzz around Rengifo to suggest he might have been on a short list of Angels players traded in advance of the July 30 deadline. At 49-63 through Tuesday, the Angels' youth movement has been a series of fits and starts that won't end in a playoff berth this year.\n\nSaturday, Rengifo returned to the 10-day injured list and planned to get his wrist re-examined. He apparently did more than that, however. According to multiple reports Tuesday in New York, where the Angels' game against the Yankees was rained out, Rengifo underwent surgery that will end his 2024 season.\n\nIn hindsight, perhaps the injury was severe enough on its own to dissuade teams from trading for the 27-year-old infielder.\n\nAccording to Jeff Fletcher of the Orange County Register, Rengifo is expected to return in time for spring training of 2025. The Angels have Rengifo under team control for one more season before he's eligible for free agency.\n\nCall it another stroke of bad luck in a season full of them. Had Rengifo's injury occurred after the trade deadline, perhaps the Angels could have recouped some value for him. As Fletcher notes:\n\nGeneral Manager Perry Minasian, without speaking specifically about Rengifo, said last week the Angels were open to trading more players on the roster than the two relievers they ultimately moved, but the offers weren't sufficient.\n\nIt is likely that the teams that would have had interest in Rengifo cooled on him because of questions about his wrist. Even after he was activated, he didn't hit well, which raised the question of whether he was fully recovered.\n\nRengifo has played 526 major league games, all with the Angels. He's hit .253/.312/.395 with 53 home runs and 42 stolen bases. Because of injuries, however, he hasn't played more than 130 games in a full season.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_paul_hoornstra@newsweek.com", "name": "Jon Paul Hoornstra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Trout", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Trout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Rengifo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Rengifo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Minasian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perry Minasian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orange County Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2444588/angels-luis-rengifo-anthony-rendon.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b4afd1ef4efb67725fcc1c9a02811b30", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788956", "eventUri": "eng-9788956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 941, "textEnd": 948}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Jonathan Hui-USA TODAY Sports / Jonathan Hui-USA TODAY Sports\n\nInfielder Luis Rengifo was placed on the 10-day injured list with what the team called \"right wrist inflammation.\" The Angels selected the contract of Charles LeBlanc in a corresponding move.\n\nRengifo is hitting an even .300, with 24 stolen bases and a solid 112 OPS+ this season. Lately, however, he's been bothered by a right wrist injury that just doesn't seem to be healing amid a full-time workload for the Angels' number-2 hitter.\n\nAccording to Jeff Fletcher of the Orange County Register, Rengifo will get additional scans on his wrist, which has been bothering him for some time.\n\nWednesday, Rengifo was removed from the Angels' game against the Colorado Rockies when the injury flared up, according to Jeff Fletcher of The Orange County Register. Rengifo was having problems with his wrist after a swing in the eighth inning of the game.\n\nEarlier this month, the 27-year-old was forced to sit out for nearly three weeks with an injury to the same wrist, missing 15 games between July 3-23.\n\nSince returning, however, Rengifo is slashing just .188/.257/.219 with only one extra-base hit in 35 plate appearances.\n\nRengifo was widely rumored to be generating interest from contending teams in advance of Tuesday's trade deadline across MLB.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox were linked to Rengifo in the days leading up to the deadline. The New York Yankees were also reportedly an interested suitor. Perhaps other teams were attracted to Rengifo, too, as he's been among the best hitters and most versatile fielders for an Angels team buried in the AL Wild Card and West races.\n\nAt least, before the injury.\n\nIn his last 11 games, Rengifo has seen his OPS fall precipitously, from .810 to .763. It's possible teams were scared off by the prospect of Rengifo's injury affecting him in the short- or long-term, which is why he remained in Anaheim after the deadline.\n\n\"If there were things presented that made the organization better, we obviously would've gotten it,\" Minasian said after a trade deadline that saw the Angels deal relievers Carlos Est\u00e9vez and Luis Garcia, both of whom were on expiring contracts. \"Those are all good players that we have under control.\"\n\nThe Angels can look forward to getting a healthy Rengifo back at some point. For now, it's unclear when that will be.\n\nZach Neto is hitting second in Rengifo's place on Saturday against the New York Mets. Brandon Drury is starting at third base. Michael Stefanic is playing second base.\n\nWe'll learn soon if that becomes the Angels' preferred arrangement in Rengifo's absence.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Rengifo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Rengifo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orange County Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stefanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Stefanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Neto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Neto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Garc\u00eda_(pitcher,_born_1996)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Garc\u00eda (pitcher, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Est\u00e9vez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Est\u00e9vez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Drury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Drury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5453,h_3067,x_0,y_568/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/halos_today/01j4dd6xkecq2mz4z4k8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788956", "eventUri": "eng-9788956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "dateEnd": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 1278, "textEnd": 1287}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

His procedure was on his elbow but was not Tommy John surgery, and he is also expected back for Spring Training.\n\nLuis Rengifo's wrist injury has plagued him for a while\n\nYes, the Angels opted not to trade Rengifo at the deadline. But that may have been because other teams simply weren't willing to give up much for someone they were not sure was healthy.\n\nRengifo missed 15 games with a wrist injury in July, which he suffered right as trade talks were heating up. Before that point, he was hitting .315 with an .800 OPS. Since coming off the Injured List, he has hit only .188 with a .476 OPS and one extra-base hit.\n\nWith the Angels out of contention for a playoff spot, there was no need to delay the inevitable with Rengifo. The Angels can now either turn their attention toward winning in 2025 or look further down the road. Rengifo will still be an attractive trade target in the offseason with a salary that probably won't match his potential.

The Angels already had space on the 40-man roster available in the aftermath of this week's trade deadline, meaning no corresponding move was necessary to make room for Leblanc on the 40-man roster. Leblanc will take the place of infielder Luis Rengifo on the active roster as Rengifo was placed on the 10-day IL due to wrist inflammation.\n\nRengifo, 27, received plenty of trade interest in the run-up to the deadline himself but ultimately remained in Anaheim, perhaps in part due to concerns surrounding his wrist. The switch-hitter was placed on the IL with right wrist inflammation just under a month ago and was ultimately sidelined for around three weeks before being activated a week prior to the deadline. Rengifo has struggled badly since his return, however, slashing just .188/.257/.219 in nine games. A week-long slump isn't necessarily indicative of anything serious, but manager Ron Washington told reporters (including Jeff Fletcher of the Orange County Register) earlier this week that Rengifo had experienced a bit of a \"flare-up\" of his previous wrist injury and would be re-evaluated in the coming days.\n\nThe infielder took the next day off but appeared in yesterday's contest, ultimately taking two at-bats before exiting in the fifth inning. Evidently, the continued problems with Rengifo's wrist have now risen to the point where the club feels a second stint on the shelf is necessary. It's not yet clear what the 27-year-old's timetable for return looks like at this point, but it's certainly a disappointing turn of events for a youngster who was enjoying a breakout season prior to the injury. Through July 2, Rengifo posted an excellent .319/.362/.448 slash line in 266 trips to the plate while splitting time between second and third base alongside cameos at shortstop and in right field. His switch-hitting bat, defensive versatility, and youth all figure to once again make him an attractive trade candidate this offseason, when he'll go through his final trip through arbitration before free agency.\n\nAs for Leblanc, the 28-year-old signed a minor league deal with the Angels back in November and will now get his first opportunity in the majors since 2022. A fourth-round pick by the Rangers in the 2016 draft, Leblanc's big league debut came six years later as a member of the Marlins. He ultimately played 48 games in Miami, slashing a respectable .263/.320/.404 with ten doubles, four homers, and four stolen bases in 169 trips to the plate for the club while splitting time between first base, second base, and third base.

Rengifo was on the IL earlier this season while dealing with the wrist injury. The injury continue to nag at him, and cause him to miss multiple weeks of play in July.\n\nRengifo has been one of the Angels' best hitters over the course of the season, slashing .300/.347/.417 with 85 hits, 41 runs, six home runs, 24 stolen bases and 30 RBIs. His batting average would be good for 10th in MLB with enough qualifying at-bats, and he ranks 11th in stolen bases this year.\n\nThe 27-year-old is in the middle of his best season in terms of batting average, on-base percentage, and stolen bases. He will fall short of playing at least 100 games for the third consecutive season, but made strong progress during his sixth season as an Angel.\n\nThe Angels were expected to trade Rengifo prior to the July 30 MLB trade deadline, but instead opted to retain him along with pitcher Tyler Anderson, and outfielders Taylor Ward and Kevin Pillar.\n\nWith the exception of Pillar, the Angels only traded players whose contracts expire at the end of this season; Rengifo, Anderson and Ward have at least one year of team control remaining. Either the Angels were unable to get what they wanted for them, believe they can contend next season, or will trade one or more this off-season.\n\nAlong with Rengifo, right-hander Chase Silseth also underwent season-ending surgery. Silseth had elbow surgery, but not Tommy John surgery. Rengifo and Silseth are both expected to be back in time for spring training next February.\n\nThe Angels have already been dealing with significant injuries to third baseman Anthony Rendon, center fielder Mike Trout, and pitcher Patrick Sandoval over the course of the year. Rendon is just making his return back to the team after getting activated Tuesday, but has played in just 33 games amid a hamstring injury.\n\nThree-time American League MVP Mike Trout has missed the majority of the season with a torn meniscus. He came close to making his return amid a rehab appearance, but was shut back down. It's unclear if he will return to the Angels this season.\n\nAdditionally, starting pitcher Patrick Sandoval underwent surgery to repair a torn UCL, ending his season in June.

The Angels did not release the exact type of surgery, but Rengifo is expected to be ready to by the start of spring training.\n\nRengifo, 27, was in the midst of an All-Star-caliber season when he first hurt his right wrist on July 3 in Oakland.\n\nHe spent about three weeks on the injured list and then returned to action, without a rehab assignment, only to hit .188 in his next 35 plate appearances.\n\nThat included two times when Rengifo had to leave games because he aggravated the wrist injury. After the second time, on Friday night, the Angels placed him on the injured list again and sent him for more tests, which revealed that he needed surgery.\n\nAmid all of that, Rengifo was considered one of the Angels' better trade chips, not only because of the strong season he was having but also because he is under team control for another season.\n\nGeneral Manager Perry Minasian, without speaking specifically about Rengifo, said last week the Angels were open to trading more players on the roster than the two relievers they ultimately moved, but the offers weren't sufficient.\n\nIt is likely that the teams that would have had interest in Rengifo cooled on him because of questions about his wrist. Even after he was activated, he didn't hit well, which raised the question of whether he was fully recovered.\n\nWhat happened subsequently certainly suggests that he might not have been.\n\nThe Angels could still trade Rengifo over the winter or even at next year's deadline. Or they could sign him to an extension and make him part of the long-term solution.\n\nRengifo finished the season with a .300 batting average, six home runs and a .763 OPS.\n\nRight-hander Chase Silseth also underwent season-ending elbow surgery, although he's expected to be ready for the start of spring training.\n\nThe Angels did not reveal details of Silseth's surgery beyond a clarification that it will not interfere with next season, which rules out Tommy John surgery.\n\nSilseth, 24, began the season in the Angels' rotation, but pitched just two games before suffering an elbow injury. He returned to action in late May and had pitched 28\u2153 innings in seven games at Triple-A, with a 6.35 ERA.\n\nHe last pitched on July 28, going for tests on his elbow a few days later.\n\nThe Angels' game against the Yankees was postponed more than three hours before the scheduled first pitch. It will be made up on Wednesday as part of a traditional doubleheader, with the first game starting at 1:05 p.m. PT.\n\nRight-hander Davis Daniel will start the first game, followed by right-hander Carson Fulmer in the second game.\n\nAssuming the rest of the trip goes without further interruptions - not a certainty, considering Hurricane Debby's impact on the East Coast - the Angels will need a sixth starter for the final game of the trip, on Sunday in Washington.\n\nThe Angels activated third baseman Anthony Rendon, who missed the minimum 10 days on the injured list because of back stiffness. Rendon replaced Taylor Ward, who was placed on the paternity list. ...\n\nThe Angels will be able to add a 27th player for Wednesday's doubleheader. ...\n\nRight-hander Jos\u00e9 Cisnero, who has been out since April because of shoulder and back problems, began a rehab assignment at Triple-A Salt Lake on Tuesday. ...\n\nMike Trout has not yet had his second meniscus surgery. The Angels announced last week that he would be having a second procedure, ending his season.\n\nAngels (RHP Davis Daniel, 1-2, 4.91 ERA and RHP Carson Fulmer, 0-2, 3.69) at Yankees (RHP Luis Gil,

He was placed on the 10-day IL on Saturday and further tests showed he needed surgery. The team said he is expected to be ready for spring training in 2025.\n\nRendon, 34, has only appeared in 33 games this season. He missed 2 1/2 months because of a hamstring strain, returning in early July to play 14 games before his latest IL stint, which was the minimum 10 days.\n\nHe has no homers, six RBIs and a .227 batting average this year.\n\nSince joining the Angels in December 2019 on a seven-year, $245 million deal, Rendon has never played more than 58 games in a season. After hitting .290 with 136 homers and 546 RBIs in 916 games for the Washington Nationals from 2013-19, he is batting .245 with 22 homers and 117 RBIs in 233 games for Los Angeles.\n\nRengifo, 27, was removed from Wednesday's game against the Colorado Rockies due to a wrist flare-up, then sat out Thursday against the Rockies. He returned to the lineup on Friday against the New York Mets but exited after four innings due to wrist inflammation.\n\nHe spent nearly three weeks on the IL after he first injured his wrist on July 3.\n\nRengifo was batting .315 before the initial wrist injury. He returned to action 20 days later and has since gone 6-for-32 (.188) in nine games with his average falling 15 points. In 78 games this season, he is hitting .300 with six home runs and 30 RBIs.\n\nOver six seasons (526 games) with the Angels, Rengifo is a .253 hitter with 53 home runs and 187 RBIs.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rendon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Rengifo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Rengifo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://lineup-publishing.s3.amazonaws.com/23803437.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788956", "eventUri": "eng-9788956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 389, "textEnd": 396}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 413, "textEnd": 420}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1800, "textEnd": 1806}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 1174, "textEnd": 1187}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

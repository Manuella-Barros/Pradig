This is the first Golden Ball to go for auction and while the value is still to be confirmed, the auction house expects it to fetch millions on June 6.\n\nMaradona, who died in 2020, won the award after leading Argentina to World Cup victory in Mexico, scoring five goals at the finals where he captained his country and played every minute of the tournament. That tournament is probably best remembered for Maradona's two goals against England in the quarter-finals.\n\nMaradona outjumped England keeper Peter Shilton as he thumped in the first goal with a raised fist, which he later dubbed as being scored by the \"Hand of God\". The second was an incredible mazy slalom run from his own half, when he dribbled past five English outfield players, and was voted as the \"Goal of the Century\".\n\nThe jersey he wore that day, along with the ball from the match, have both previously been sold at auction. After his display against England, Maradona went on to score the two goals which defeated Belgium in the semi-final and Argentina won a thrilling final 3-2 against West Germany.\n\nThe Golden Ball award was introduced at the 1982 World Cup, and its list of winners include Italy's Paolo Rossi, Romario and Ronaldo of Brazil, Zinedine Zidane of France, while Argentine great Lionel Messi is the only player to have won the accolade twice. Maradona's award had disappeared before resurfacing among several trophy lots in an auction room.\n\nRecently it was entrusted to Aguttes, which carried out an investigation into its provenance and managed to authenticate it as Maradona's Adidas Golden Ball trophy.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shilton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Shilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Rossi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paolo Rossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rom\u00e1rio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rom\u00e1rio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinedine_Zidane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zinedine Zidane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronaldo_(Brazilian_footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/22_07_2020_11_18_31_0109211.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546092", "eventUri": "eng-9546092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 318, "textEnd": 324}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian\n\nDiego Maradona's Golden Ball trophy won for being named the best player at the 1986 World Cup will be auctioned in France in June, the Aguttes auction house said on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the first Golden Ball to go for auction and while the value is still to be confirmed, the auction house expects it to fetch millions on June 6.\n\nMaradona, who died in 2020, won the award after leading Argentina to World Cup victory in Mexico, scoring five goals at the finals where he captained his country and played every minute of the tournament.\n\nThat tournament is probably best remembered for Maradona's two goals against England in the quarter-finals.\n\nMaradona outjumped England keeper Peter Shilton as he thumped in the first goal with a raised fist, which he later dubbed as being scored by the \"Hand of God\".\n\nThe second was an incredible mazy slalom run from his own half, when he dribbled past five English outfield players, and was voted as the \"Goal of the Century\".\n\nThe jersey he wore that day, along with the ball from the match, have both previously been sold at auction.\n\nAfter his display against England, Maradona went on to score the two goals which defeated Belgium in the semi-final and Argentina won a thrilling final 3-2 against West Germany.\n\nThe Golden Ball award was introduced at the 1982 World Cup, and its list of winners include Italy's Paolo Rossi, Romario and Ronaldo of Brazil, Zinedine Zidane of France, while Argentine great Lionel Messi is the only player to have won the accolade twice.\n\nMaradona's award had disappeared before resurfacing among several trophy lots in an auction room.\n\nRecently it was entrusted to Aguttes, which carried out an investigation into its provenance and managed to authenticate it as Maradona's Adidas Golden Ball trophy.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdnews24_com@bdnews24.com", "name": "Bdnews24 Com",

Maradona, who passed away in 2020 at the age of 60, captained Argentina to a 3-2 victory over West Germany in the final, held in Mexico City. His remarkable performance in that World Cup included two unforgettable goals in the quarterfinals against England -- the controversial \"Hand of God\" goal and the \"Goal of the Century.\"\n\nMaradona received the Golden Ball at a ceremony on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in 1986, but the trophy vanished soon after, giving rise to various theories about its disappearance. Some speculated that Maradona lost it in a poker game, while others suggested that he sold it to pay off debts. Another rumor claimed that it was stored in a Naples bank safe, which was later robbed by local gangsters in 1989 when Maradona was playing in Italy's Serie A.\n\nAguttes, however, refuted the rumor that the trophy was melted down into gold pieces, noting that it was made of a gold-copper alloy. The auction house confirmed that the trophy is the original Adidas Golden Ball awarded to Maradona. It resurfaced in 2016 as part of a private collection that was later auctioned in Paris. Aguttes has meticulously verified and authenticated the trophy to ensure its authenticity.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes, highlighted the significance of the 1986 World Cup, stating that it showcased Maradona's incredible talent, not just with his feet but also with his hands -- referring to the \"Hand of God\" goal. To participate in the auction on June 6, bidders are required to place a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000).

There are a lot of stories and legends, some inconsistent like [being used] to make gold with the mafia.\n\n\"We have also two biographies of Maradona where it doesn't speak about [the trophy being] stolen. We did necessary checks with database Art Loss and Interpol. We called the police but without result, so we think we did everything we have to do.\"\n\nAguttes' catalogue calls the mafia theory \"far-fetched\" given that the trophy is made from a gold-copper alloy.\n\nThe item was bought at an auction along with several other trophies, though the anonymous buyer didn't realise at the time that it was Maradona's Golden Ball, Thierry explained.\n\nAguttes has undertaken a range of checks - examining the manufacturing information, the dating, the irregularities, the patina and the oxidation - to verify the trophy's authenticity.\n\n\"When we saw it was okay, it was an amazing discovery,\" said Thierry.\n\nMaradona's death from a heart attack at the age of 60 was mourned by millions in Argentina and around the world as the loss of one of the game's greatest ever players.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Shilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised_fist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raised fist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1fia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nDiego Maradona's Golden Ball trophy from the 1986 World Cup has resurfaced. The award, which had been missing for decades, will be auctioned in Paris next month, the Aguttes house said Tuesday.\n\nMaradona, who died in 2020 at age 60, was awarded the trophy for his scintillating play at the tournament, where he captained Argentina in its 3-2 win over West Germany in the final in Mexico City. Before that, he scored the controversial \"Hand of God\" goal and the \"Goal of the Century\" in a 2-1 win over England in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe auction house said it expects the trophy \"to fetch millions due to its uniqueness.\"\n\nMaradona received the award -- given to the tournament's best player -- at a ceremony at the Lido cabaret on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in 1986. It subsequently disappeared, giving rise to rumors.\n\nSome say it was lost during a wild poker game, or sold to pay off debts, Aguttes said.\n\nOthers said Maradona had stored it in a safe in a Naples bank that was robbed by local gangsters in 1989, when he played in the Italian league. According to the story told by a reformed member of the mafia, the trophy was then melted down into gold pieces.\n\n\"A far-fetched theory, given that it was made of a gold-copper alloy,\" Aguttes said in its auction catalogue.\n\nAguttes said the trophy reappeared in 2016 among other lots that were acquired from a private collection at auction in Paris.\n\n\"It was thoroughly investigated and authenticated as Diego Maradona's Adidas Golden Ball trophy,\" Aguttes said.\n\nThe \"Hand of God\" goal came when Maradona punched the ball into England's net for his team's opener. Maradona was also a magician with the ball at his feet and four minutes later, he weaved through England's midfield and defense and then past goalkeeper Peter Shilton for what FIFA later declared the greatest goal in World Cup history.\n\n\"To say that this World Cup had it all would be an understatement ... it was also, and above all, the tournament where Diego Maradona really showed the world what he could do with his feet, and even with his hands,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes.\n\nBidders will be asked to make a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000) to participate in the June 6 auction.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1fia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Shilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/12/16/09/APTOPIX_WCup_Argentina_Soccer_64407.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546092", "eventUri": "eng-9546092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2342, "textEnd": 2348}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

This is the most important individual distinction awarded to Maradona for a tournament in which he captained Argentina to World Cup victory, scored the 'Goal of the Century' and the infamous 'Hand of God' goal against England in the politically charged quarter-final encounter.\n\nJorge Burruchaga, Argentinian teammate of Diego Maradona and scorer of the winning goal at the 1986 World Cup says, \"At that 1986 World Cup, Diego shone like never before or since in his career; it was his monument. We knew we had the best player in the world, there was no doubt about it, we knew it for a fact.\"\n\n\"My favourite recollection of this World Cup is the second goal he scored against England, which remains the most beautiful in history for me because you must consider the state of the pitch, the altitude, the context between the two countries, and what he managed to do... He breezed past six players... It was divine. On that day, he created a lasting legacy for all Argentinian sportsmen and women, not just footballers, showing just how much, you have to fight to be worthy of wearing the Argentine jersey.\"\n\nDiego Armando Maradona was named \"Player of the 20th Century\" by FIFA, along with Pele, and this trophy symbolizes his greatest achievement and his greatest ever goal.\n\nSince the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the Adidas Golden Ball has rewarded the best player of the tournament, and thus constitutes one of the most prestigious individual distinctions in the world of football.\n\nMaradona received the Adidas Golden Ball trophy at Lido (Paris, France) on November 13, 1986, as the best player of the World Cup. A unique piece in the history of football, this award given to the most emblematic player of this sport, alongside Pele, constitutes a first in the art market: no Adidas Golden Ball trophy has been presented at auction, until today. The FIFA Museum (Zurich, Switzerland) preserves the Adidas Golden Ball from 1990.\n\nWhile the Adidas Golden Ball changes design at each World Cup, the 1986 trophy uses the designs of the official Adidas \"Azteca\" ball used for this World Cup in Mexico.\n\nAt a recent auction, the shirt worn by Diego Maradona during the 1986 World Cup match against England, was sold for a reported figure in region of $7 million. It was sold by former England player Steve Hodge who exchanged shirts with Maradona after the classic world Cup match with Maradona scoring the 'Hand of God' goal and the 'Goal of the Century.' The Adidas Golden Ball trophy encompasses and marks all of that history.\n\nFrancois Thierry, sports expert for Aguttes Auction House says \"Used far too often wrongly, the word \"legend\" fits Diego Maradona perfectly. He is to football what Muhammad Ali is to boxing or Michael Jordan to basketball, an icon who goes far beyond the boundaries of his sport. He is certainly one of the most human athletes we have ever known, with his strengths and weaknesses.

This is the most important individual distinction awarded to Maradona for a tournament in which he captained Argentina to World Cup victory, scored the 'Goal of the Century' and the infamous 'Hand of God' goal against England in the politically charged quarter-final encounter.\n\nAlso Read | China: Two Killed, 21 Injured in Knife Attack Incident at Hospital in Yunnan Province, Police Launch Probe; Picture of Accused Surfaces.\n\nJorge Burruchaga, Argentinian teammate of Diego Maradona and scorer of the winning goal at the 1986 World Cup says, \"At that 1986 World Cup, Diego shone like never before or since in his career; it was his monument. We knew we had the best player in the world, there was no doubt about it, we knew it for a fact.\"\n\n\"My favourite recollection of this World Cup is the second goal he scored against England, which remains the most beautiful in history for me because you must consider the state of the pitch, the altitude, the context between the two countries, and what he managed to do... He breezed past six players... It was divine. On that day, he created a lasting legacy for all Argentinian sportsmen and women, not just footballers, showing just how much, you have to fight to be worthy of wearing the Argentine jersey.\"\n\nAlso Read | West Nile Fever in Kerala: Cases of West Nile Virus Infection Reported From Three Districts, Health Minister Veena George Directs All Districts To Be Vigilant.\n\nDiego Armando Maradona was named \"Player of the 20th Century\" by FIFA, along with Pele, and this trophy symbolizes his greatest achievement and his greatest ever goal.\n\nSince the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the Adidas Golden Ball has rewarded the best player of the tournament, and thus constitutes one of the most prestigious individual distinctions in the world of football.\n\nMaradona received the Adidas Golden Ball trophy at Lido (Paris, France) on November 13, 1986, as the best player of the World Cup. A unique piece in the history of football, this award given to the most emblematic player of this sport, alongside Pele, constitutes a first in the art market: no Adidas Golden Ball trophy has been presented at auction, until today. The FIFA Museum (Zurich, Switzerland) preserves the Adidas Golden Ball from 1990.\n\nWhile the Adidas Golden Ball changes design at each World Cup, the 1986 trophy uses the designs of the official Adidas \"Azteca\" ball used for this World Cup in Mexico.\n\nAt a recent auction, the shirt worn by Diego Maradona during the 1986 World Cup match against England, was sold for a reported figure in region of $7 million. It was sold by former England player Steve Hodge who exchanged shirts with Maradona after the classic world Cup match with Maradona scoring the 'Hand of God' goal and the 'Goal of the Century.' The Adidas Golden Ball trophy encompasses and marks all of that history.\n\nFrancois Thierry, sports expert for Aguttes Auction House says \"Used far too often wrongly, the word \"legend\" fits Diego Maradona perfectly. He is to football what Muhammad Ali is to boxing or Michael Jordan to basketball, an icon who goes far beyond the boundaries of his sport. He is certainly one of the most human athletes we have ever known, with his strengths and weaknesses. The golden kid \"El Pibe de Oro\" (The GoldenBoy) also nicknamed \"the God of football\", is a special case in the history of world football, a raw and instinctive talent, in a career punctuated by strokes of brilliance with both success and excess. The history of football with a capital H is closely linked to that of Maradona.\"\n\nAdidas Golden Ball trophy - copyright AGUTTES Auction House - Yann Vernerie\n\nFor further information, please visit: https://www.aguttes.com/trophee-adidas-golden-ball-de-diego-maradona\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by PNN.

Maradona was also a magician with the ball at his feet and four minutes later, he weaved through England's midfield and defence and then past goalkeeper Peter Shilton for what FIFA later declared the greatest goal in World Cup history.\n\n\"To say that this World Cup had it all would be an understatement ... it was also, and above all, the tournament where Diego Maradona really showed the world

Maradona was also a magician with the ball at his feet and four minutes later, he weaved through England's midfield and defense and then past goalkeeper Peter Shilton for what FIFA later declared the greatest goal in World Cup history.\n\n''To say that this World Cup had it all would be an understatement ... it was also, and above all, the tournament where Diego Maradona really showed the world what he could do with his feet, and even with his hands,'' said Fran\u00e7ois Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes.\n\nBidders will be asked to make a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000) to participate in the June 6 auction.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1fia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Shilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1714769250", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546092", "eventUri": "eng-9546092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2414, "textEnd": 2420}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Expected to fetch \"millions,\" the award has resurfaced and is scheduled for auction on 6 June, facilitated by the French company Aguttes.\n\nThe auction house in Paris expressed the challenge of providing an estimate for the sale due to the trophy's uniqueness. They emphasised it as a world-first, as there has never been any comparable item. Francois Thierry, the sports expert at Aguttes, noted that numerous stories and legends surround the trophy. However, he mentioned that they conducted thorough checks and even reached out to the authorities for verification.\n\nThierry told CNN Sport, \"We expect millions (again), but we don't know exactly because there is no trophy like that in the world... from the pinnacle of Maradona's career. It's the unique opportunity of a lifetime for the potential buyer.\"\n\n\"We lost track of it in 1986, there's been 38 years now. There are a lot of stories and legends, some inconsistent like (being used) to make gold with the mafia. We have also two biographies of Maradona where it doesn't speak about (the trophy being) stolen.\n\n\"We did necessary checks with database Art Loss and Interpol. We called the police but without result, so we think we did everything we have to do. When we saw it was okay, it was an amazing discovery.\"\n\nThierry also hailed Maradona, insisting he remains one of the greatest to ever grace the game. \"Used far too often wrongly, the word \"legend\" fits Diego Maradona perfectly,\" he continued. \"He is to football what Mohamed Ali is to boxing or Michael Jordan to basketball, an iconic icon who goes far beyond the boundaries of his sport. He is certainly one of the most human athletes we have ever known, with his strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\"The golden kid \"El Pibe de Oro\" also nicknamed \"the God of football\", is a special case in the history of world football, a raw and instinctive talent, in a career punctuated by strokes of brilliance with both success and excess. The history of football with a capital H is closely linked to that of Maradona.\"\n\nSince the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the Golden Ball has honored the tournament's best player, solidifying its position as one of the most esteemed individual accolades in football. Maradona was presented with the Golden Ball trophy in Paris at Lido on 13 November, 1986, in recognition of his outstanding performance as the top player of the World Cup.\n\nWhen it goes up for sale, it will mark the inaugural auction of a Golden Ball trophy. Although the design of the Golden Ball changes with each World Cup, the 1986 trophy incorporates the patterns of the official Adidas \"Azteca\" ball utilised during the tournament in Mexico.\n\nWhile numerous football enthusiasts may regard the 1986 tournament as memorable, for many England fans, it will forever be associated with Maradona's \"Hand of God\" goal. \"To say this World Cup had it all would be an understatement: phenomenal goals were scored, and countless world-class talents were on display,\" Thierry added.\n\n\"It is also, above all, at this tournament that Diego Maradona really showed the whole world what he could do with his feet, and even with his hands...\" On 22 June of that year, England faced Argentina in the quarterfinals, a mere four years after the Falklands War.\n\nMaradona infamously outmanoeuvred England's goalkeeper Peter Shilton, utilising his raised fist to punch the ball into the net for his first goal, a move he later described as being scored by the \"Hand of God.\" Mere four minutes later, he netted another goal, later voted as the \"Goal of the Century\" in a FIFA poll. Starting from his own half, he skilfully bypassed five England players before slotting home his second goal.\n\nCrafted from a gold copper alloy, the trophy stands at 28 cm tall and weighs approximately four kilograms. The match ball involved in Maradona's infamous \"Hand of God\" goal fetched \u20ac1.8 million in November 2022, while his famed-shirt brought in \u20ac8.6m.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karate@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Karate", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sam_may@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Sam May", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_hand_of_God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The hand of God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1fia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Shilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ball (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadio_Azteca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estadio Azteca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falklands War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Awards", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/296521/c/Maradona+World+Cup.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546092", "eventUri": "eng-9546092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 372, "textEnd": 378}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 3419, "textEnd": 3426}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

This is the most important individual distinction awarded to Maradona for a tournament in which he captained Argentina to World Cup victory, scored the 'Goal of the Century' and the infamous 'Hand of God' goal against England in the politically charged quarter-final encounter.Jorge Burruchaga, Argentinian teammate of Diego Maradona and scorer of the winning goal at the 1986 World Cup says, \"At that 1986 World Cup, Diego shone like never before or since in his career; it was his monument. We knew we had the best player in the world, there was no doubt about it, we knew it for a fact.\"\"My favourite recollection of this World Cup is the second goal he scored against England, which remains the most beautiful in history for me because you must consider the state of the pitch, the altitude, the context between the two countries, and what he managed to do... He breezed past six players... It was divine. On that day, he created a lasting legacy for all Argentinian sportsmen and women, not just footballers, showing just how much, you have to fight to be worthy of wearing the Argentine jersey.\"Diego Armando Maradona was named \"Player of the 20th Century\" by FIFA, along with Pele, and this trophy symbolizes his greatest achievement and his greatest ever goal.Since the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the Adidas Golden Ball has rewarded the best player of the tournament, and thus constitutes one of the most prestigious individual distinctions in the world of football.Maradona received the Adidas Golden Ball trophy at Lido (Paris, France) on November 13, 1986, as the best player of the World Cup. A unique piece in the history of football, this award given to the most emblematic player of this sport, alongside Pele, constitutes a first in the art market: no Adidas Golden Ball trophy has been presented at auction, until today. The FIFA Museum (Zurich, Switzerland) preserves the Adidas Golden Ball from 1990.While the Adidas Golden Ball changes design at each World Cup, the 1986 trophy uses the designs of the official Adidas \"Azteca\" ball used for this World Cup in Mexico.At a recent auction, the shirt worn by Diego Maradona during the 1986 World Cup match against England, was sold for a reported figure in region of $7 million. It was sold by former England player Steve Hodge who exchanged shirts with Maradona after the classic world Cup match with Maradona scoring the 'Hand of God' goal and the 'Goal of the Century.' The Adidas Golden Ball trophy encompasses and marks all of that history.Francois Thierry, sports expert for Aguttes Auction House says \"Used far too often wrongly, the word \"legend\" fits Diego Maradona perfectly. He is to football what Muhammad Ali is to boxing or Michael Jordan to basketball, an icon who goes far beyond the boundaries of his sport. He is certainly one of the most human athletes we have ever known, with his strengths and weaknesses. The golden kid \"El Pibe de Oro\" (The GoldenBoy) also nicknamed \"the God of football\", is a special case in the history of world football, a raw and instinctive talent, in a career punctuated by strokes of brilliance with both success and excess. The history of football with a capital H is closely linked to that of Maradona.\"Adidas Golden Ball trophy - copyright AGUTTES Auction House - Yann VernerieFor further information, please visit: https://www.aguttes.com/trophee-adidas-golden-ball-de-diego-maradona(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by PNN.

The award, which had been missing for decades, will be auctioned in Paris next month, the Aguttes house said Tuesday.\n\nMaradona, who died in 2020 at age 60, was awarded the trophy for his scintillating play at the tournament, where he captained Argentina in its 3-2 win over West Germany in the final in Mexico City. Before that, he scored the controversial \"Hand of God\" goal and the \"Goal of the Century\" in a 2-1 win over England in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe auction house said it expects the trophy \"to fetch millions due to its uniqueness.\"\n\nMaradona received the award - given to the tournament's best player - at a ceremony at the Lido cabaret on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in 1986. It subsequently disappeared, giving rise to rumors.\n\nSome say it was lost during a wild poker game, or sold to pay off debts, Aguttes said.\n\nOthers said Maradona had stored it in a safe in a Naples bank that was robbed by local gangsters in 1989, when he played in the Italian league.

Maradona was also a magician with the ball at his feet and four minutes later, he weaved through England\u00b4s midfield and defense and then past goalkeeper Peter Shilton for what FIFA later declared the greatest goal in World Cup history.\n\n\"To say that this World Cup had it all would be an understatement ... it was also, and above all, the tournament where Diego Maradona really showed the world what he could do with his feet, and even with his hands,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes.\n\nBidders will be asked to make a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000) to participate in the June 6 auction.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nFILE - Argentina's national soccer team coach Diego Maradona attends a news conference in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2009.

Aguttes has thoroughly investigated and authenticated the trophy as the original Adidas Golden Ball trophy awarded to Diego Maradona.

The auction is expected to generate significant interest from collectors and football enthusiasts worldwide, given the historical importance and rarity of the trophy.\n\n(Inputs from AP)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Maradona was also a magician with the ball at his feet and four minutes later, he weaved through England's midfield and defense and then past goalkeeper Peter Shilton for what FIFA later declared the greatest goal in World Cup history.\n\n\"To say that this World Cup had it all would be an understatement ... it was also, and above all, the tournament where Diego Maradona really showed the world what he could do with his feet, and even with his hands,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes.\n\nBidders will be asked to make a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000) to participate in the June 6 auction.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1fia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Shilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e82828f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1992x1121+0+940/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2Fc6%2F96af47fa12e700716182e3de7903%2F09563217a5fe4f999ae6826988b7ceab", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546092", "eventUri": "eng-9546092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2207, "textEnd": 2213}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

His inspirational performances amounted to what is widely considered the finest individual showing at a major tournament in world football history.\n\nHi sheer genius and the controversy that so often followed him were encapsulated in a politically-charged quarter-final against England. He first scored his infamous 'Hand of God' goal before dribbling through the entire England defence to score one of the greatest goals of all time.\n\nHis former Argentina teammate, Jorge Burruchaga, recalled: \"At that 1986 World Cup, Diego shone like never before or since in his career; it was his monument. We knew we had the best player in the world, there was no doubt about it, we knew it for a fact.\n\n\"My favourite recollection of this World Cup is the second goal he scored against England, which remains the most beautiful in history for me because you must consider the state of the pitch, the altitude, the context between the two countries, and what he managed to do.\"\n\nAt a recent auction, the shirt worn by Maradona during the match against England, was sold for a reported figure of $7 million. It was sold by the former England player Steve Hodge who exchanged shirts with Maradona after the classic World Cup clash at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_hand_of_God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The hand of God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Hodge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Hodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Burruchaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Burruchaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadio_Azteca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estadio Azteca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/24LLIG46HBELBPHOG4WWN3RA6Y.jpg?smart=true&auth=1edc1f4b03ff296d81a80bfcec6c1cd0bfd08425a82b4c4d318ad5abfbff612a&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546092", "eventUri": "eng-9546092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 142, "textEnd": 148}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-11-", "textStart": 384, "textEnd": 395}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

There are a lot of stories and legends, some inconsistent like [being used] to make gold with the mafia.\n\n\"We have also two biographies of Maradona where it doesn't speak about [the trophy being] stolen. We did necessary checks with database Art Loss and Interpol. We called the police but without result, so we think we did everything we have to do.\"\n\nAguttes' catalogue calls the mafia theory \"far-fetched\" given that the trophy, a small soccer ball on top of a plinth, is made from a gold-copper alloy.\n\nThe item was bought at an auction along with several other trophies, though the anonymous buyer didn't realize at the time that it was Maradona's Golden Ball, Thierry explained.\n\nAguttes has undertaken a range of checks - examining the manufacturing information, the dating, the irregularities, the patina and the oxidation - to verify the trophy's authenticity.\n\n\"When we saw it was okay, it was an amazing discovery,\" said Thierry.\n\nMaradona was unquestionably a household name before the 1986 World Cup, but after leading Argentina to the title, he became a global superstar.\n\nThe breathtaking skill he demonstrated on the pitch was matched by extreme lows off it: addiction, substance abuse, illegitimate children and feuds over money all blighted the Argentine at various stages throughout his career.\n\nAn unacknowledged son, photo opportunities with the mafia and cocaine binges were shown in British Oscar-winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia's documentary on Maradona's time at Napoli, where the forward has been granted deific status for leading the club to two league titles and the 1989 UEFA Cup.\n\nHis death from a heart attack at the age of 60 was mourned by millions in Argentina and around the world as the loss of one of the game's greatest ever players.\n\nMaradona's remains lie in a private cemetery on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, but his children have recently filed a request with the Argentine Courts for the body to be moved to a safer place where fans can pay their respects.\n\nCNN's Matias Grez and Ben Morse contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_ramsay@aol.com", "name": "George Ramsay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1fia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

Decades later, it's expected to sell for millions", "body": "(CNN) -- Diego Maradona's Golden Ball trophy from the 1986 World Cup, which had gone missing in contested circumstances for decades, has reappeared and is anticipated to sell for millions of dollars at auction next month.\n\nThe trophy, presented to the best player at each World Cup, will be sold by Aguttes auction house in Paris on June 6, the latest piece of memorabilia from Maradona's glittering career to be expected to fetch a huge sum.\n\nIn 2022, his Argentina jersey from the 1986 tournament sold for close to $9.3 million, breaking the record for an item of sports memorabilia, while the \"Hand of God\" ball from the quarterfinal against England sold for $2.4 million later that year.\n\n\"We expect millions [again], but we don't know exactly because there is no trophy like that in the world ... from the pinnacle of [Maradona's] career,\" Fran\u00e7ois Thierry, a sports expert for Aguttes Auction House, told CNN Sport.\n\n\"It's the unique opportunity of a lifetime for the potential buyer.\"\n\nMaradona is best remembered for his performance against England during the 1986 World Cup, punching the ball into the net for his infamous \"Hand of God\" goal before scoring what was later voted the \"Goal of the Century,\" slaloming past several defenders with a magnificent, weaving run.\n\nThe two goals were less than five minutes apart and perfectly encapsulate the sublime skill and tortured genius of the Argentine star, who passed away in 2020.\n\nArgentina went on to defeat West Germany 3-2 in the final and win the second of the country's three World Cup titles.\n\nThe history of the Golden Ball trophy awarded to Maradona in Paris after the tournament is shrouded in mystery.\n\nAccording to one tale, it was stolen by the mafia while Maradona was playing for Italian side Napoli and subsequently melted into gold ingots; other theories suggested that it was lost during a poker game or to pay off Maradona's well-documented debts.\n\n\"We did a lot of research about it,\" said Thierry. \"We lost track of it in 1986, there's been 38 years now. There are a lot of stories and legends, some inconsistent like [being used] to make gold with the mafia.\n\n\"We have also two biographies of Maradona where it doesn't speak about [the trophy being] stolen. We did necessary checks with database Art Loss and Interpol. We called the police but without result, so we think we did everything we have to do.\"\n\nAguttes' catalogue calls the mafia theory \"far-fetched\" given that the trophy, a small soccer ball on top of a plinth, is made from a gold-copper alloy.\n\nThe item was bought at an auction along with several other trophies, though the anonymous buyer didn't realize at the time that it was Maradona's Golden Ball, Thierry explained.\n\nAguttes has undertaken a range of checks - examining the manufacturing information, the dating, the irregularities, the patina and the oxidation - to verify the trophy's authenticity.\n\n\"When we saw it was okay, it was an amazing discovery,\" said Thierry.\n\nMaradona was unquestionably a household name before the 1986 World Cup, but after leading Argentina to the title, he became a global superstar.\n\nThe breathtaking skill he demonstrated on the pitch was matched by extreme lows off it: addiction, substance abuse, illegitimate children and feuds over money all blighted the Argentine at various stages throughout his career.\n\nAn unacknowledged son, photo opportunities with the mafia and cocaine binges were shown in British Oscar-winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia's documentary on Maradona's time at Napoli, where the forward has been granted deific status for leading the club to two league titles and the 1989 UEFA Cup.\n\nHis death from a heart attack at the age of 60 was mourned by millions in Argentina and around the world as the loss of one of the game's greatest ever players.\n\nMaradona's remains lie in a private cemetery on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, but his children have recently filed a request with the Argentine Courts for the body to be moved to a safer place where fans can pay their respects.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Ball To Be Auctioned", "body": "Naija News reports that the Aguttes auction house announced this remarkable discovery on Tuesday.\n\nDue to its unique historical significance, the trophy is anticipated to garner millions at auction.\n\nDiego Maradona, who led Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup held in Mexico, was immortalized in football history not only for his outstanding skills but also for his infamous \"Hand of God\" goal against England.\n\nThe Golden Ball trophy, awarded to him as the tournament's best player, had been shrouded in mystery for decades, and there were numerous rumours about its whereabouts.\n\nAccording to various accounts, the trophy was believed to have been stolen or lost under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nA reformed mafia member once claimed it had been melted down into gold pieces, while other stories suggested it vanished during a high-stakes poker game or was sold to settle debts.\n\nAnother tale told of Maradona storing it in a safe deposit box in a Naples bank, only for it to be stolen by local criminals in 1989.\n\nThe trophy's recovery was as unexpected as its disappearance.\n\nThe BBC reports that Francois Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes auction house, shared that the trophy was purchased by an anonymous buyer who initially did not realize the significance of his acquisition.\n\n\"He bought it with many other items, and initially, he did not know it was something important,\" Thierry explained.\n\nIt was only after doing some internet research and finding similarities with the Golden Ball that the buyer understood the potential value of what he had.\n\nDespite attempts to verify the trophy's authenticity by contacting Maradona and FIFA, the buyer had no success but was determined through extensive research and consultation with experts that it was indeed a genuine article.\n\nThis trophy not only symbolizes Maradona's pinnacle achievements but also his status as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, football players of the 20th century.\n\nGiven the past auction results of Maradona's memorabilia, such as his jersey and the match ball from the England game, which fetched millions, expectations are high for the upcoming auction.\n\nDiego Maradona passed away on November 25, 2020, at the age of 60 due to heart failure shortly after undergoing brain surgery, leaving behind a legacy that continues to live on through stories and now, the upcoming auction of this once-lost treasure.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors":

The auction will take place in Paris suburb on June 6.\n\nAccording to the online edition of France Football, a specialist soccer magazine in France, the trophy went missing in 1989 when it was stolen from a bank in Naples, where Maradona was playing at the time. In 2016, a man successfully bid several hundred euros on a number of trophies at an auction in Paris and noticed that one of them was Maradona's missing trophy. The man reportedly expects the trophy to fetch between \u20ac12 million-\u20ac15 million (about \u00a52 billion-\u00a52.5 billion).\n\nMaradona contributed to Argentina winning the World Cup by scoring the \"Hand of God\" goal and by sprinting past five opposition players to win a point. In 2022, a uniform he wore fetched about \u00a37.14 million (about \u00a51.16 billion at the time) at auction.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yomiuri_Shimbun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yomiuri Shimbun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Naples"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_hand_of_God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The hand of God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Maradona-trophy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546092", "eventUri": "eng-9546092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 559, "textEnd": 565}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 312, "textEnd": 325}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Korea Times file\n\nBy John Duerden\n\nIn the first game at the 1986 World Cup, 32 years after its previous appearance, South Korea faced Argentina and lost 3-1. It was a game immortalized in East Asia in an iconic image of Huh Jung-moo tackling Diego Maradona in a rather forceful manner. At the time, Maradona was the best player in the world, and many still think he is the best that's ever been.\n\nIt was no surprise then that the Koreans did their best to keep Maradona quiet, with Huh given the task of doing so.\n\n\"I remember Huh very well,\" Maradona said at the 2010 World Cup, coach of Argentina at the time, while Huh was in charge of the Taeguk Warriors, where they were due to meet. \"In 1986, the Koreans played taekwondo, not football, against us.\"\n\nThere was probably no other way to stop him. Nobody could. Whether Maradona is the best player of all time is a matter of opinion, but all would surely agree that he was the star of the 1986 World Cup and dragged Argentina to the global title in a heroic and dramatic fashion. FIFA certainly thought so and awarded the legend the Adidas Golden Ball trophy after it all finished, the prize given to the tournament's best player.\n\nThat golden trophy is up for auction on June 6 at the world-famous Aguttes International Auction House in Paris. Serious interest is expected.\n\n\"At that 1986 World Cup, Diego shone like never before or since in his career; it was his monument,\" Jorge Burruchaga, Argentinian teammate of Diego Maradona and scorer of the winning goal in the 1986 World Cup final as the South Americans defeated West Germany 3-2, said. \" We knew we had the best player in the world, there was no doubt about it, we knew it for a fact.\"\n\nYet it is the 2-1 quarterfinal win against England in Mexico City that everyone remembers. Maradona's first goal was called the \"Hand of God\" moment -- when he punched the ball into the net. It remains one of the most famous, if not the most famous, goal ever scored, though there is competition from the second goal he scored that day. He picked the ball up from inside his own half, and the rest is history as they say.\n\n\"My favorite recollection of this World Cup is the second goal he scored against England, which remains the most beautiful in history for me because you must consider the state of the pitch, the altitude, the context between the two countries and what he managed to do,\" said Burruchaga.\n\n\"He breezed past six players ... It was divine. On that day, he created a lasting legacy for all Argentinian sportsmen and women, not just footballers, showing just how much you have to fight to be worthy of wearing the Argentine jersey.\"\n\nThat jersey was given by the man himself to England midfielder Steve Hodge at the final whistle. In 2022, it was sold at auction by Hodge for a figure reported to be around $7 million.\n\nThe golden ball, which was fittingly awarded to Maradona in Paris 38 years ago, is another piece of football history. South Korea may not have progressed past the group stage in that tournament, but it was still an honor to share the field with Diego Maradona when he was at his very best. Korea, too, shares that history.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huh_Jung-moo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huh Jung-moo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Burruchaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Burruchaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taekwondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_hand_of_God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The hand of God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Hodge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Hodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/e337f181496146f49c3b74ecc69735e7.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546092", "eventUri": "eng-9546092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1380, "textEnd": 1386}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Woodland was the two-time defending Class M champion. Saturday at the UConn softball complex, the story played out the same way again. Woodland won its third straight title, beating Sheehan 7-1 for the Class M championship. Junior pitcher Ella Van Alstyne, who had three hits, two RBI, scored a run and had six strikeouts, was named the MVP. Catcher Julia Rowley had two doubles and scored three runs and had a big pickoff play at third in the second inning.

They\u2019re a great program. There\u2019s a reason why they\u2019ve won it three times in a row. \u201cToday just wasn\u2019t our day. I think some mental mistakes were costly. We were putting the bat on the ball right at the beginning and getting runners on base and making things happen, being able to string those hits together and making sure they\u2019re falling in the right spots \u2013 they just didn\u2019t fall for us.\u201d Woodland got three runs in the second inning when Van Alstyne hit a two-run single and Rowley drove home another run with a double. Woodland picked up another run in the third, two in the fourth and another in the fifth when Rowley doubled and scored on a single by Van Alstyne. With no outs and runners on first and third, Rowley picked off a Sheehan runner at third in the second inning and after a flyout and a single to Rylee Brunelle, Van Alstyne got a strikeout to end the inning.

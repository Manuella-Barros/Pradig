SCARY COLLISION: Detroit Tigers' Colt Keith leaves game with left knee discomfort after scary collision Game notes: Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal is currently the gambling favorite to win the American League Cy Young, with BetMGM listing the lefty at +170 to take home the award given to the league's top pitcher. Baltimore Orioles starter Corbin Burnes is next closest at +450, a sizeable gap that shows just how good Skubal has been this year. After a strong close to the 2023 season, Skubal has taken the 2024 campaign by the reins. He's dominating hitters and consistently helping the Tigers get wins (albeit with more run support than many of the fellow starters on the team) with an impressive 7-1 record. But a look at his advanced analytics shows that he's anything but a product of just some timely offense. According to Baseball Savant, Skubal ranks in the top 10 percentile in five of the Statcast statistics that measure how hitters are performing (wOBA, xwOBA, hard hit percentage, walk percentage and xERA). Skubal throws his fastball more than any other pitch and is dominating when he does so. Batters are hitting just .151 against his four-seam fastball that averages 96.7 mph, but Skubal can ramp that up sometimes and has even hit 100 mph this year. What makes those numbers even more impressive is Skubal primarily throws the fastball against right-handed hitters. Out of the 344 fastballs Skubal has thrown this year, 325 have been against right-handers. There have been just 11 hits against the four-seamer. The fastball is just one of the reasons Skubal has been dominating this year, as the other statistics on the rest of his arsenal don't look too much different. Pretty much any stat you look at will reveal just how much Skubal has been cooking this year, but it all starts with the fastball. After Skubal's start on Sunday, the Tigers will have a day off on Monday before hosting the Washington Nationals for the start of a new series on Tuesday.

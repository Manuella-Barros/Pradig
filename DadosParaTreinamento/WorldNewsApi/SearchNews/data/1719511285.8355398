On Friday (May 24), the long-running animated comedy series released its latest special, titled \u201cThe End of Obesity,\u201d through Paramount+. The episode takes aim at the Ozempic craze and uses the pop-rap star singer as an alternative to the popular weight loss drug. The special begins with South Park character Eric Cartman visiting his doctor\u2019s office in an effort to get Ozempic as a way to drop some weight. Since he can\u2019t afford the pricey drug and his insurance won\u2019t cover it, the physician offers him another solution. \u201cI\u2019m going to write you a prescription for Lizzo,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cShe\u2019s a really good singer who talks about body positivity, and just being happy with the way you look. I want you to listen to Lizzo five times a day, and watch her videos just before bedtime. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to be on Lizzo for the rest of your life.\u201d Lizzo caught wind of the joke and reacted to it with a TikTok video of herself watching a portion of the South Park episode and giving her thoughts. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I just feel like, damn, I\u2019m really that b\u2014-,\u201d she says. \u201cI really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a f\u2014 to the point where these men in Colorado know who the f\u2014 I am and put it on their cartoon that\u2019s been around for 25 years.\u201d Earlier this month, Lizzo gave an update on her mental health amid lawsuits against her and frustration over public criticism toward. \u201cI\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve been in 10 months,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe strange thing about depression is you don\u2019t know you\u2019re in it until you\u2019re out of it. I\u2019m definitely not all the way as carefree as I used to be.. But the dark cloud that followed me every day is finally clearing up. My smile reaches my eyes again and that\u2019s a win. I thought my album was finished.. but I gotta get some of these good vibes off in a banger real quick. Thanks for your patience.\u201d The \u201cGood as Hell\u201d singer has been under scrutiny over the past year, as she\u2019s been involved in a harassment lawsuit brought by three of her former dancers in August 2023. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles by dancers Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez, accuses Lizzo and her Big Grrrl Big Touring Inc. of a wide range of legal wrongdoing and included dozens of pages of detailed allegations. Lizzo denied the claims in a response shared to Twitter, calling them \u201cfalse allegations\u201d and \u201csensationalized stories.\u201d Watch Lizzo\u2019s reaction to South Park on Instagram below.", "summary": "\u201cI really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a f---,\" she says.", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lizzo-south-park-ozempic-episode-joke-reaction-1235693236/", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lizzo-grammy-awards-carpet-2023-billboard-1548.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:27:12", "author": "Mitchell Peters", "authors": ["Mitchell Peters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.135}

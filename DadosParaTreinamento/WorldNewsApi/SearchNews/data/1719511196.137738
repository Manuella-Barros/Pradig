The expat woman in her 30s was cycling along Tai Mei Tuk Road in Tai Po and began going down a slope towards a barbeque pit in an area popular with cyclists. As she approached the YHA Bradbury Jockey Club Tai Mei Tuk Youth Hostel, she crashed into the lowered boom barrier and fell to the ground at about 7pm, police said. She sustained injuries to her chest and was taken unconscious to the nearby Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, where she was later pronounced dead. Police are investigating the cause of the accident. In December 2016, an 18-year-old woman cycling down the same slope crashed into the boom barrier. She was pronounced dead in Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin about an hour later.", "summary": "Expat woman in her 30s was cycling along Tai Mei Tuk Road in Tai Po when she struck lowered boom barrier.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3264182/woman-cycling-northern-hong-kong-crashes-boom-barrier-dies-chest-injuries", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/26/783e9b45-8c30-40b9-a6f2-9e3c53ba7974_5c677c08.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:52:30", "author": "Danny Mok", "authors": ["Danny Mok"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.758}

Joshua has promised to use the Gypsy King\u2019s own words against him when they eventually clash in the ring. In a recent interview, the 33-year-old heavyweight revealed he hangs on to every taunt and jibe made by Fury, \u2018meditating\u2019 on the remarks and storing them in his memory as fuel for their future battle. \u201cThis is one of my rivals, this is someone I want to compete with one day,\u201d Joshua growled in a video on YouTube when asked what he felt about being called a sausage by Fury. \u201cEverything he says I store it in my memory and when the fight happens I want to use it as fuel,\u201d he added. The towering 6ft 6in champ, who once held the IBF, WBA, WBO, and IBO heavyweight titles, is back amongst the boxing elite after a terrible defeat to Andy Ruiz. Following a better 12-round rematch against Ruiz, Joshua has since bounced back in style, despite failing twice against the latest heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk. He has recorded three impressive wins since then, including a victory against fellow African and former MMA star Francis Ngannou from Cameroon. Ahead of a much-anticipated fight against Fury, Joshua\u2019s response to Fury\u2019s insults serves as a warning to the Gypsy King. Known for his calm and composed demeanor, Joshua\u2019s uncharacteristically feisty comments have set pulses racing among boxing fans eager to see who will have the guts to trade verbal blows with the sporting superstar.", "summary": "<p>British-Nigerian boxer, Anthony Joshua, has spread anticipation for a future bout with Tyson Fury by firing shots in a budding war of words with his big rival.

Michael and Clare had been holidaying together on the breathtaking Greek island of Symi when the TV doctor vanished, sparking a frantic search. It was former GP Clare who raised the alarm after the 67-year-old failed to return from a walk along St Nicholas Beach on Wednesday, June 5. Tragically, hopes of bringing Michael safely home were dashed after his body was discovered on Sunday morning. He was reportedly found at a rocky area beside the Agia Marina beach, close to a network of caves known as 'The Abyss'. Here, the Mirror looks at Michael and Clare's strong and loving marriage, with the pair having supported each other personally and professionally over their 44 years together. The nutrition expert was best known for his work promoting intermittent fasting and the low-carb ketogenic diet, having written popular books and created a health plan called The Fast 800 - his latest business venture alongside Clare, who is also a GP. The married pair turned business partners were together for 44 years, having met at medical school. Michael, who was born in India before moving to boarding school in England as a youngster, went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford and started on a very different path as a banker in London. After two years on the job, he wanted a new career in medicine but had intended to become a psychiatrist, studying at UCL Medical School in 1980. It was here that he found lasting love. \"100 of us in the year and the Dean said four of you will marry, and I met Clare then,\" Michael told Sussex Living magazine in January. Michael and Clare have three sons aged 33, 31 and 29, and a 24-year-old daughter. Following their father's disappearance, their four children flew out to Greece to try to retrace his steps, and offer support to their mother. The couple lived in Buckinghamshire, in a property built by the Cadbury family back in 1905. The mum-of-four had a huge influence on Michael's eating habits, as they both likened him to a 'Labrador' and her to a 'Grey Hound'. Before they met, Michael never ate greens and Clare previously revealed she had to hide chocolate from her husband. \"We say that he's a labrador because they eat anything,\" she told The Times in April. \"There were times when he would open a packet of biscuits and the whole lot would be gone.\" After their youngest flew the nest, Michael and Clare spent the past few years dining as just the two of them, often discussing the latest dietary research at the table. They both enjoyed a glass of red wine together on the weekend, with favourite dinners including fish and greens. Immediately after getting out of bed, their mornings started with seven minutes of exercise, usually consisting of planks and push-ups, before a breakfast made up of eggs. Michael also loved marmalade on toast, just like the character Paddington Bear. Sticking to his mantra, the TV doctor, who regularly appeared on ITV's This Morning and hosts a BBC podcast called Just One Thing, fasted once a week and avoided eating three hours before bed. The couple have worked together for the last 10 years, both on the Fast 800 programme and other projects. Speaking about what it was like to do business together, Michael previously explained that they worked from separate wings of the house and \"would meet for coffee.\" Clare added: \"Honestly, it has been a real pleasure.\" Two weeks before his devastating disappearance, Michael shed some insight into their loving marriage in one final tweet. Taking to social media platform X, previously known as Twitter, on May 25, one of Michael's followers enquired whether or not he'd spotted himself being parodied on Dead Ringers, remarking, 'I'd see it as an honour'. Michael replied: \"I have.. I'm not convinced I really sound like that but my wife Clare says it is spot on.\" Heartbreakingly, Clare also shared a sweet snap of her husband just a week before he went missing. Just last week, the excited couple, who were both seen sporting bold red jackets, filmed themselves attending the Hay Festival, which took place between May 23rd and June 2nd. The pair looked elated as they were joined by writers and experts in their fields to give talks to attendees. Clare simply captioned the video: \"Such a brilliant festival. Our second year and hope to make it a regular! So many fascinating talks.\" Fans were quick to share their excitement with one person writing under the post: \"Awesome.\" Meanwhile, another person shared a series of clapping emojis. The TV doctor's wife alerted the emergency services after her husband vanished on a coastal walk on Wednesday in the area of St Nicholas Beach. His body was later discovered beneath a fence that runs around a bar on Agia Marina beach, amid hilly, rocky terrain. Agia Marina bar manager Ilias Tsavaris, 38, first spotted Michael's remains after the island's mayor 'saw something' by the fence and alerted staff. Ilias said: \"They saw it with the boat. The mayor came and saw something so that is when they called me and said 'Hey they saw something go and check there'.\" \"They called me, they said 'You know what we saw something from far away, can you go and check' so I went there. So when I walked up I saw something like a body to make sure. You don't see a dead body every day, it is not a warzone, it's summer you are supposed to have fun and swimming.\" He added: \"He came from Pedi OK, and he walked not through the restaurant. If he had walked through there (the bar) we would have checked the cameras.\" Do you have a story to share?

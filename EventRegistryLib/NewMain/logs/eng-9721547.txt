This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe man Novak Djokovic was supposed to face on Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, withdrew hours before their scheduled quarterfinal because he jarred his hip at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months. It's too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz's fourth-round opponent, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise -- and maybe worse -- that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to the American at what the two-time major finalist characterized as a wide open opportunity to grab a first Grand Slam title.\n\nDanielle Collins' last Wimbledon appearance before retirement ended with tape wrapped around her hamstring, the work of a trainer during the American's fourth-round loss to 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova. Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ... A lot of things are changing that (contribute) to players getting injured.\"", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Hours before their scheduled quarterfinal, though, de Minaur withdrew because of a hip injury sustained at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\nDe Minaur had tried to remain optimistic, and he practiced Wednesday morning before deciding he wouldn't be able to take the competition court.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything can make this injury go from three to six weeks (of recovery) to four months. It's too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz's fourth-round opponent on Wednesday, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise -- and maybe worse -- that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to Fritz. Zverev, a two-time major finalist, was frustrated by the nature of the end of a run he had characterized as a wide-open opportunity to grab his first Grand Slam title.\n\nDanielle Collins' last Wimbledon appearance before retirement ended with tape wrapped around her hamstring, the work of a trainer during the 30-year-old American's fourth-round loss to 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova. Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down,\" Collins said. \"I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement.\n\n\"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nAP photo by Mosa'ab Elshamy / Novak Djokovic falls during his fourth-round match against Holger Rune on Monday at Wimbledon. A knee injury sustained at the French Open led to Djokovic withdrawing from the clay-court major tournament and having surgery, but he said that has led to him being more careful about his footing on the grass of the All England Club.\n\nOW, THAT HURTS\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously. You never want to see this,\" said de Minaur, who called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears earlier in the week when she stopped because of a leg injury at 5-all in the third set of a fourth-round match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open women's singles title three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be fellow British player Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against No. 5 Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nDjokovic can be counted among those who think part of the problem is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas at the All England Club with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery,\" Djokovic said. \"So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that. I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nAP photo by Kirsty Wigglesworth / Madison Keys leans over during her fourth-round match against Jasmine Paolini on Sunday at Wimbledon. A leg injury led to Keys withdrawing with the deciding third set tied at 5.\n\nTURF IS TRICKY\n\nThe pattern began at grass tournaments that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. She showed up at Wimbledon but wound up becoming the first reigning champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped during her third-round match against Krejcikova because of a back injury.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tuneup tournament after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at Wimbledon with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open in early June, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright in London.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay.

Moments earlier, on Court 1, Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov had to retire due to injury after a slip in the first set against Daniil Medvedev, 28, left him limping.\n\nRelated: Emma Raducanu seeking her definitive Wimbledon moment\n\nThe roofs of Centre Court and Court 1 have been closed for much of the tournament as there were only two dry days in the first week. Eight players slipped while the roofs were covered on the show courts.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, it feels like we've been playing an indoor grass court tournament here more than [an] outdoor, to be honest. I played every single match basically indoor,\" Djokovic said after defeating Denmark's Holger Rune, 21, on Monday evening.\n\n\"But, once you close the roof, you know the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw, like Dimitrov [on Sunday]. We saw [Alexander] Zverev as well in his previous match slightly injured his knee. That was troubling him even [on Monday].\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that. I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions, the humidity.\"\n\nSpeaking earlier on Monday, Sally Bolton, the chief executive of the All England Club (AELTC), denied the slips were due to the roofs being closed.\n\n\"The two show courts with the roofs, the courts are very dry, the roofs have not been open significantly - there isn't any dampness in there,\" she told reporters. \"In both show courts, we have a complex mechanism for keeping the air in the right condition for the court to be in the right condition.\n\n\"Those systems have been working very hard but they've been working fine so we have no concerns about the courts.\"\n\nRelated: Wimbledon diary: AI mishaps, clippings and reaction-speed testers\n\nShe said that the grass \"has got more moisture in it\" in the first few days of the championships, but that the courts tend to dry out as they wear.\n\n\"But that's the nature of grass courts themselves rather than any particular conditions as a result of the wet weather we've had,\" Bolton added.\n\nWimbledon has previously said 600 air distributors pump dry air into the courts to prevent condensation forming on the surface.\n\nGreg Rusedski, the former world No 4, defended the surface. \"It's called grass, you're supposed to slip,\" he told reporters as he prepared to take part in the mixed-invitation doubles.\n\n\"Everybody's like, 'Oh, there's a bad bounce.' God almighty - go and play in the 1990s and the last century. You're expecting bad bounces, it's not supposed to be perfect. Grass courts have never been better. Also, you've got to look at the way the grass works ... You're going to slip, that's part of the business and you've just got to deal with it.\"\n\nRelated: Rain, set and match: a day at Wimbledon 2024 - in pictures\n\nThe conditions also made headlines in 2021 after Serena Williams slipped and was forced to retire and Djokovic later complained that he could not remember falling over so many times on a court.

This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe man Novak Djokovic was supposed to face on Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, withdrew hours before their scheduled quarterfinal because he jarred his hip at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months. It's too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz's fourth-round opponent, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise -- and maybe worse -- that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to the American at what the twotime major finalist characterized as a wide open opportunity to grab a first Grand Slam title.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Now what? Marketplace dining opening at Hard Rock Bristol\n\nDanielle Collins' last Wimbledon appearance before retirement ended with tape wrapped around her hamstring, the work of a trainer during the American's fourth-round loss to 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova. Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ... A lot of things are changing that (contribute) to players getting injured.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration

Moments earlier, on Court 1, Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov had to retire due to injury after a slip in the first set against Daniil Medvedev, 28, left him limping.\n\nThe roofs of Centre Court and Court 1 have been closed for much of the tournament as there were only two dry days in the first week. Eight players slipped while the roofs were covered on the show courts.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, it feels like we've been playing an indoor grass court tournament here more than [an] outdoor, to be honest. I played every single match basically indoors,\" Djokovic said after defeating Denmark's Holger Rune, 21, on Monday evening.\n\n\"But, once you close the roof, you know the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw, like Dimitrov [on Sunday]. We saw [Alexander] Zverev as well, in his previous match, slightly injured his knee. That was troubling him even [on Monday].\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that. I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions, the humidity.\"\n\nSpeaking earlier on Monday, Sally Bolton, the chief executive of the All England Club (AELTC), denied the slips were due to the roofs being closed.\n\n\"The two show courts with the roofs, the courts are very dry, the roofs have not been open significantly - there isn't any dampness in there,\" she told reporters. \"In both show courts, we have a complex mechanism for keeping the air in the right condition for the court to be in the right condition.\n\n\"Those systems have been working very hard but they've been working fine so we have no concerns about the courts.\"\n\nShe said that the grass \"has got more moisture in it\" in the first few days of the championships, but that the courts tend to dry out as they wear.\n\n\"But that's the nature of grass courts themselves rather than any particular conditions as a result of the wet weather we've had,\" Bolton added.\n\nWimbledon has previously said 600 air distributors pump dry air into the courts to prevent condensation forming on the surface.\n\nGreg Rusedski, the former world No 4, defended the surface. \"It's called grass, you're supposed to slip,\" he told reporters as he prepared to take part in the mixed-invitation doubles.\n\n\"Everybody's like, 'Oh, there's a bad bounce.' God almighty - go and play in the 1990s and the last century. You're expecting bad bounces, it's not supposed to be perfect. Grass courts have never been better. Also, you've got to look at the way the grass works ... You're going to slip, that's part of the business and you've just got to deal with it.\"\n\nThe conditions also made headlines in 2021 after Serena Williams slipped and was forced to retire and Djokovic later complained that he could not remember falling over so many times on a court. In 2013, several players, including Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka, slipped on one day.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emine_sinmaz@theguardian.com", "name": "Emine Sinmaz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sammy_gecsoyler@theguardian.com", "name": "Sammy Gecsoyler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulu_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lulu Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Raducanu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emma Raducanu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bolton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Rusedski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Rusedski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Azarenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria Azarenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sharapova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Sharapova"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Ringtennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Ringtennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f121d9b06217cc17da0941efcf72d5ddb4af143/0_71_3963_2379/master/3963.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=65155cded4a4abbc4a45e88c04b6663d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721547", "eventUri": "eng-9721547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ... A lot of things are changing that (contribute) to players getting injured.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ... A lot of things are changing that (contribute) to players getting injured.\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe man Novak Djokovic was supposed to face on Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, withdrew hours before their scheduled quarterfinal because he jarred his hip at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months. It's too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz's fourth-round opponent, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise -- and maybe worse -- that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to the American at what the two-time major finalist characterized as a wide open opportunity to grab a first Grand Slam title.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening.

This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe man Novak Djokovic was supposed to face on Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, withdrew hours before their scheduled quarterfinal because he jarred his hip at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months. It's too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz's fourth-round opponent, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise -- and maybe worse -- that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to the American at what the two-time major finalist characterized as a wide open opportunity to grab a first Grand Slam title.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level.

The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment.

This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe man Novak Djokovic was supposed to face on Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, withdrew hours before their scheduled quarterfinal because he jarred his hip at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months. It's too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz's fourth-round opponent, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise -- and maybe worse -- that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to the American at what the two-time major finalist characterized as a wide open opportunity to grab a first Grand Slam title.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained.\n\n\"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ... A lot of things are changing that (contribute) to players getting injured.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration

This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe man Novak Djokovic was supposed to face on Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, withdrew hours before their scheduled quarterfinal because he jarred his hip at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months. It's too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz's fourth-round opponent, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise -- and maybe worse -- that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to the American at what the two-time major finalist characterized as a wide open opportunity to grab a first Grand Slam title.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNew store opens at Southlake Mall Judge rejects plea in domestic shooting; man threatens to throw chair at judge Golden Corral in Merrillville reopens after closing in 2020 after then-franchisee's cold case arrest for Missouri murder Region coffee shop employee empties registers in IRS phone scam, police say 18-year-old dies in car crash on Fourth of July in Portage, police said NWI Business Ins and Outs: Taco Pros, Brass Idol, Red Zone Sports Bar, Windy City Pizza Kitchen, Sweet Circle, Starbucks, Alexander McQueen and Caribbean Roots opening; Evvy's Coffee and Deep Blue Seafood closing Dispensaries stacking up on Michigan border despite weed remaining illegal in Indiana Inmate dies at Porter County Jail, police say Wrecking ball comes for St. Margaret's Hospital in downtown Hammond Hobart roundabout moving to phase two Church's much-anticipated Harvest Square Strip Mall to have ribbon-cutting, bring 'services of suburbs' to Gary Cedar Lake man found dead while sitting in a pond, police say $80 million Palace Theatre redevelopment billed as biggest investment in downtown Gary in 50 years Exterior of Region home found on fire early Friday, large response reported Twisted Sugar opens in Schererville Friday\n\nDanielle Collins' last Wimbledon appearance before retirement ended with tape wrapped around her hamstring, the work of a trainer during the American's fourth-round loss to 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova.

Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ...

This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe man Novak Djokovic was supposed to face on Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, withdrew hours before their scheduled quarterfinal because he jarred his hip at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months. It's too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz's fourth-round opponent, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise -- and maybe worse -- that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to the American at what the two-time major finalist characterized as a wide open opportunity to grab a first Grand Slam title.\n\nPeople are also reading... 3 dead in plane crash near McDowell, Rutherford county line Plane crashes in McDowell; emergency crews ask people to avoid Brackett Town Road Marion man meets McDowell paramedic who saved his life 24 years ago Toddler killed by truck at Steel Creek campground north of Morganton Golden Hour Charcuterie opens in Marion's Depot District 3 from South Carolina die in Nebo plane crash; national safety board investigating Body found Sunday was Marion man; cause of death pending toxicology report Nebo woman charged with break-in McDowell Little League crowns two champions; league to host a baseball state tournament Burkemont Mountain in Morganton ablaze with 30-acre wildfire When are the 4th of July fireworks, parades in McDowell County?

Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ... A lot of things are changing that (contribute) to players getting injured.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration

Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you're not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I'm doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It's unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles -- which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon -- because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It's normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it's tough -- the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I'm sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament -- so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday -- has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It's probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I've been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness -- because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It's very demanding on the body. ...

This much is certain: The timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe man Novak Djokovic was supposed to face on Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, withdrew hours before their scheduled quarterfinal because he jarred his hip at the end of a victory two days earlier.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" de Minaur said. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months. It\u00b4s too much to risk.\"\n\nTaylor Fritz\u00b4s fourth-round opponent, Alexander Zverev, slipped on an unworn patch of green grass in his previous match. That caused a bone bruise - and maybe worse - that Zverev complained left him on \"one leg\" in his loss to the American at what the two-time major finalist characterized as a wide open opportunity to grab a first Grand Slam title.\n\nDanielle Collins' last Wimbledon appearance before retirement ended with tape wrapped around her hamstring, the work of a trainer during the American\u00b4s fourth-round loss to 2021 French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova. Collins chalked it up to failing to \"think about every little step that you take.\"\n\n\"There's been a ton of injuries on the grass. Left and right, it seems like people are going down. I am, I guess, frustrated that I feel like I was focusing on my tactics and kind of what I needed to do to play at a high level. Usually, I feel like, on other surfaces you\u00b4re not having to think so critically about your movement,\" Collins said. \"The one second I take my mind off of it, not think about every little thing I\u00b4m doing with my footwork, it ends up happening.\"\n\nAlex de Minaur of Australia falls during his fourth round match against Arthur Fils of France at the Wimbledon tennis championships in London, Monday, July 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali)\n\nThe falls keep happening. The injuries are adding up.\n\n\"It\u00b4s unfortunate, obviously,\" de Minaur said. \"You never want to see this.\"\n\nHe called his mishap \"more of a freak injury,\" related to the \"excessive amount of force\" used to slide on grass.\n\nMadison Keys, the 2017 U.S. Open runner-up, was in tears when she stopped because of a hurt leg at 5-all in the third set of a Week 2 match against Jasmine Paolini, who reached Thursday's semifinals.\n\nEmma Raducanu, who won the U.S. Open three years ago, withdrew from mixed doubles - which was supposed to be Andy Murray's last event at Wimbledon - because of a sore wrist, then needed a medical timeout later that day after falling in the third set of a singles loss.\n\nNo. 17 Anna Kalinskaya cited a bad wrist when she quit in her fourth-round match against 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev with a leg problem.\n\n\"It\u00b4s normal for the second week at Wimbledon to be feeling niggling things on your muscles, because it\u00b4s tough - the grass, getting down low, coming into the net. It's more on the muscles than the joints on the grass,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis said. \"So I\u00b4m sure lots of people will be feeling it now with little things here and there.\"\n\nCount Djokovic among those who think part of the issue is that all of the rain during the tournament - so much that the mixed doubles final was shifted from Thursday to Sunday, and play began a half-hour earlier than usual on most courts Wednesday - has made the grass more slick and the footing less sure.\n\nSo has shutting the retractable roofs at Centre Court and No. 1 Court, the only two arenas with that luxury during wet weather.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there\u00b4s more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately, some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can\u00b4t really change that,\" added the seven-time champion at the All England Club. \"I mean, it\u00b4s grass. It\u00b4s a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions.\"\n\nThe pattern began at grass tourneys that preceded Wimbledon.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova retired from a match in Berlin after hurting her right leg there. When she showed up at Wimbledon, she became the first defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round and acknowledged: \"I was a bit scared because of my leg.\"\n\nThe woman who beat her last week, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, stopped at Wimbledon because of a back issue in the third round against Krejcikova.\n\nFrances Tiafoe pulled out of the Queen's Club tournament before Wimbledon after spraining a ligament in his right knee when he took a tumble. Tiafoe played at the All England Club with a black sleeve over his knee and made it to the third round before losing to defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDjokovic tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match at the French Open, had surgery and returned to competition less than a month later. Ironically, he thinks it's possible that might have helped him stay upright this fortnight.\n\nThat's because, years ago, Djokovic was one of the first players to regularly slide on grass the way they do on clay. He has cut down on those movements this time at Wimbledon, being extra careful to avoid risking falls.\n\n\"It\u00b4s probably part of my, I guess, different kind of movement on the court that I\u00b4ve been really experimenting with because of the cautiousness - because of the knee and everything that was happening prior to the tournament,\" Djokovic explained. \"The first couple rounds, I was still not maybe willing to go (for difficult) balls and slide and make splits.\"\n\nOther theories include: More and more baseline play on grass, and less serving-and-volleying, creates longer points and extra running, which translate into a greater likelihood of slips; less comfort on grass because players tend to grow up practicing and competing on clay or hard courts; and a brief grass portion of the schedule that doesn't allow for accumulating a lot of experience on the turf.\n\nThen there's the general wear-and-tear of a season.\n\n\"Listen, tennis is a very physical sport at the moment. For sure, the rallies are longer. Matches. Scheduling. Finishing late,\" 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis said. \"It\u00b4s very demanding on the body. ... A lot of things are changing that (contribute) to players getting injured.\"\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis\n\nNovak Djokovic of Serbia falls during his fourth round match against Holger Rune of Denmark at the Wimbledon tennis championships in London, Monday, July 8, 2024.

Play on No 1 Court began at 1pm while Centre was 1.30pm. The remaining 16 courts saw outdoor play between the hours of 11am and 6pm before retiring for the evening a few hours early due to the inclement weather.\n\nDjokovic's fourth-round victory over Hune took place during the showers - which continued into Tuesday at the All England Club - yet in the aftermath of victory, the Serb highlighted the high incidence of injuries and the correlation with roof closures generally at the Championships.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, it feels like we've been playing an indoor grass court tournament here more than outdoor, to be honest,\" Djokovic said. \"I played every single match basically indoors. We are blessed to have the roof, don't get me wrong, particularly on the two big courts. I feel the frustration of the players obviously because you get interrupted many times during the day. Obviously it's not something you can affect. The rain is there, it's there.\n\n\"But once you close the roof, you know that the grass is going to be more slippery. So there's more chances that players will fall. Unfortunately some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw, like Dimitrov yesterday. We saw Zverev as well in his previous match slightly injure his knee.\n\n\"It's part of this surface. You can't really change that. I mean, it's grass. It's a live surface, and it reacts to different conditions, the humidity etc.\"\n\nAlthough SW19 is an outdoor event, Wimbledon installed a roof on Centre Court, which takes 10 minutes to retract, in 2009 with No 1 Court's own following 10 years later to mitigate for the volatile British summer, which has plagued this year's championship.\n\nProtocol dictates that the match referees, with oversight from the tournament director, have ultimate control over the use of the roofs and their decision is final. Telegraph Sport understands that officials erred on the side of caution on Monday due to the forecasted downpours. Should play start \"outdoors\" on the two main showcourts, the arrival of rain can cause delays with the covers having to be brought on, the players departing, and the roof closing. Then, under the new \"indoor\" conditions, players are entitled to a full warm-up before play recommences.\n\nOn Monday evening, Matt Roberts, host of the highly respected Tennis Podcast, speaking about Elena Rybakina's fourth-round win over Anna Kalinskaya agreed with Djokovic, branding the situation \"bizarre\" and \"odd\".\n\n\"It did not start raining here until 6pm, which is when play was suspended on the outdoor courts,\" Roberts said. \"There was no rain until then, play continued on the outdoor courts. Yet they played all matches on Centre and No 1 Court under the roof.\n\n\"It wasn't raining and we played indoors all day. It has just become accepted now. I understand anticipating rain and not wanting to change conditions mid-match, but I think that would be preferable to what we had today which was just an indoor tournament on the two main showcourts.\n\n\"The roofs are so quick to close now, and there isn't that much of a delay, it is just about the change of conditions, which is a factor that [the organisers] consider more important. I just think it is bizarre that it was perfectly dry here today and there could have been four-and-a-half or five hours of play on the show courts and we were indoors. I just think that is odd.\"\n\nWimbledon officials informed Telegraph Sport that the match referees, with oversight from the tournament director, have ultimate control over the use of the roofs and their decision is final.\n\nTelegraph Sport understands, however, that the referee does have the ability to request the roof shut for the start of a match if the forecast indicates that rain is imminent and that, on Monday, officials will have been swayed by the forecasted downpours. Should play start \"outdoors\" on the two main showcourts, the arrival of rain can cause delays with the covers having to be brought on, the players departing, and the roof closing. Then, under the new \"indoor\" conditions, players are entitled to a full warm-up before play recommences.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kalinskaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anna Kalinskaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bZ5TUJIRkZKHiQBPUj2pLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/980eee1dfdddae26ee0058765ff217f5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721547", "eventUri": "eng-9721547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Much like the nimbostratus these past nine days. In the lead-up to The Championships, it was the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic's right knee and two-time champion Andy Murray's back, both of whom had surgeries, and third-seeded Aryna Sabalenka's shoulder that were the talking points.\n\nThere was no respite from injury and illness woes in the days that followed - Aslan Karatsev (groin), Thanasi Kokkinakis (knee), Jessica Bouzas Maneiro (back), Beatriz Haddad Maia (back), Hubert Hurkacz (knee), Anna Kalinskaya (wrist), Lucas Pouille (abdominal) Madison Keys (hamstring), Grigor Dimitrov (knee), Alexander Zverev (knee) and Jannik Sinner (illness). As if that wasn't enough, on quarterfinal Wednesday, after praying for a miracle for two days, the number nine-seed Aussie Alex de Minaur withdrew from his last eight clash against Djokovic with a hip injury he suffered in the dying minutes of his fourth-round clash against Frenchman Arthur Fils on Monday.\n\n\"I'm devastated, but I had to pull out due to a hip injury, a little tear (of the fiber cartilage that connects the adductor),\" he said. \"I felt a loud crack during the last three points of my match against Fils and got a scan yesterday, it confirmed that this was the injury. There's a high risk of making it worse if I was to step on court.\"\n\nIt has been that kind of a Wimbledon, great accesses being the order of the day. It didn't help either that since the showers were intermittent on most days, players were on and off the courts quicker than children doing the rounds of rides in a weekend fair.\n\nNot surprisingly then that Daniil Medvedev's victory over world number one Jannik Sinner on Tuesday was the 36th men's match this year to go to five sets a new professional era Grand Slam record. The previous record of 35 five-setters was equaled at this year's Australian Open after the record was established at the 1983 US Open. The Wimbledon record stood at 34 five-set matches in the 1969 Championships. Medvedev didn't think the increase in number of five-setters had anything to do with the rain.\n\n\"Maybe the level is closer than before,\" the fifth seed said. \"Grass is a surface where it's tough to win in straight sets, like 4-4-4. One break can decide the outcome of the set.\n\n\"You do one bad game on your serve, double-fault, easy miss or something like this, and you can lose the set. In my opinion, it's more about grass court tennis itself.\" Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz pointed at the conditions, which were completely different when the roof was closed and open. Djokovic, who has been playing with a knee sleeve, stressed that he's feeling 'really good'.\n\n\"Once you close the roof, it feels like we've been playing an indoor grass court tournament. I played every single match basically indoor. We are blessed to have the roof, don't get me wrong, particularly on the two big courts that we can play out our matches and also the other matches on the outside courts are not played.\n\n\"I feel the frustration of the players obviously because you get interrupted many times during the day. Obviously it's not something you can do anything about. If the rain is there, it's there,\" the 37-year-old said.\n\n\"Obviously it's not something you can do anything about. If the rain is there, it's there,\" the 37-year-old said. \"Unfortunately some of the falls have caused some of the players to withdraw.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prajwal_hegde@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Prajwal Hegde", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kalinskaya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Kalinskaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatriz_Haddad_Maia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beatriz Haddad Maia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aslan_Karatsev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aslan Karatsev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanasi_Kokkinakis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thanasi Kokkinakis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Keys", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Keys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Pouille", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Pouille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Fils", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Fils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111650291,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54736,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721547", "eventUri": "eng-9721547", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

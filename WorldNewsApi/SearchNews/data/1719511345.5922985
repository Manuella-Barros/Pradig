{"id": 223769570, "title": "16 Ukrainians killed in besieged Kharkiv after Russia bombs market", "text": "At least 16 people were killed after a Russian airstrike hit a massive construction supplies store in Kharkiv, local officials said. The attack on Ukraine\u2019s second largest city, which has recently seen some of the most intense fighting of the war, saw two guided bombs hit the marker on Saturday, leaving 43 others injured and another 16 missing, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said more than 200 people were inside the store when the bombs hit, with the top official sharing footage and images from inside the market during the blast. The dramatic video shows a man standing with his back to the bathrooms department inside the store when an explosion suddenly covers everything in ash and smoke. The video goes on to show the massive clouds of black smoke billowing from the destroyed store as many civilians flee the disaster site while others appear to stay and assist first responders in carrying the wounded and fighting the flames. \u201cIf Ukraine had sufficient air defense systems and modern combat aircraft, Russian strikes like this one would have been impossible,\u201d the Ukrainian president said on X. \u201cAnd that is why we appeal to all leaders, to all states: we need a significant enhancement of air defense and sufficient capabilities to destroy Russian terrorists.\u201d Charles Michel, the European Council President, slammed that airstrike on the store as an \u201catrocious\u201d act that clearly targeted civilians. \u201cRussia\u2019s efforts to terrorize Ukrainian civilians as part of its war of aggression against Ukraine are criminal,\u201d Michel wrote on X, urging the West to continue aiding Kyiv. \u201cTogether, we can stop Russia\u2019s brutal attacks,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to urgently advance on a comprehensive air defense solution for Ukraine.\u201d The attack was followed by another airstrike that hit Kharkiv\u2019s city center just hours later, injuring at least 25 people, according to the Kyiv Independent. Zelensky warned that Sunday\u2019s attacks were just a precursor to a larger assault looming against Kharkiv and the northern border. The Ukrainian president claimed that the Kremlin had already deployed troops just north of Kharkiv, which together with Sumy, hold a population of about 250,000 people living within 15 miles of the border. In recent weeks, Moscow has touted its military advancements in the region, claiming to have captured villages around Kharkiv as part of a broad push into the region that would allow it to get within artillery range of the city. Since the start of the offensive targeting Kharkiv on May 10, Ukrainian officials have evacuated more than 11,000 people from the region. Despite the pressure from Russia, Zelensky has touted that the Kremlin has lost eight times as many soldiers as the Ukraine since the battles along the northern border began.

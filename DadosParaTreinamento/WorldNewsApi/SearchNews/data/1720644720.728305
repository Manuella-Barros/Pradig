{"id": 231264218, "title": "All the Glastonbury 2024 'secret act' rumours getting fans excited", "text": "Could these artists play Glastonbury 2024? (Pictures: Getty/Rex) Glastonbury Festival is right around the corner with thousands of music fans set to make the pilgrimage to Worthy Farm for a weekend of live music. Those that secured tickets will be treated to headline sets from the likes of Dua Lipa, Coldplay, and SZA, with Shania Twain performing in the traditional Sunday Legends slot. And while the weather looks set to be \u2018wetter than average\u2019, music lovers will be looking forward to a weekend of entertainment from hundreds of varied artists. Among this year\u2019s fun is the alleged promise of secret acts, with huge names popping up every year to dazzle lucky fans. Last year saw the Foo Fighters pop in to play a few songs, with past secret sets including the likes of Lady Gaga, Pulp, George Ezra, Mumford and Sons, and Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke. Rumours are already swirling as to who could pop up this year, with these bands and artists at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds. Kasabian There could be some Happenings at Glastonbury linked to these indie legends (Picture: Medios y Media/Getty Images) Kasabian are the most hotly tipped band to be performing a secret set at this year\u2019s Glasto \u2013 so much so that, according to NME, William Hill has suspended betting on the band \u2018after seeing some telling bets.\u2019 The Leicester rockers have played the iconic festival five times, headlining the Pyramid Stage for the first time in 2014. The festival kicks off a week before the release of their latest studio album, Happenings, leading many to believe they may pop in to play a few new tracks. The Killers Check out these tour dates (Picture: Bryan Bedder/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images) When it comes to predicting Glasto secret sets, many fans look at tour schedules and where telling gaps appear around June. The Killers, coincidentally, are touring their new greatest hits release Rebel Diamonds in the UK \u2013 with a huge gap between shows in Glasgow and London which coincides with Glastonbury. Fronted by Brandon Flowers, the band have hit the festival four times, headlining in 2019 which broke records as the loudest set of the event\u2019s history at 106 decibels. Should they be one of the secret set at this year\u2019s event, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time after the band surprised fans with a performance on the John Peel stage in 2017. Gaps in the Glastonbury Festival schedule when secret sets could take place Wednesday, June 26 \u2013 Greenpeace Stage \u2013 12pm Friday, June 28 \u2013 Wishing Well \u2013 8.45pm Friday, June 38 \u2013 location TBA \u2013 Transgressive Takeover at 11pm Friday, June 28 \u2013 Firmly Rooted \u2013 1am Saturday, June 29 \u2013 BBC Introducing Stage \u2013 4.30pm Saturday, June 29 \u2013 Woodies Stage \u2013 6pm Saturday, June 29 \u2013 Levels \u2013 12am Sunday, June 30 \u2013 BBC Introducing Stage \u2013 7.30pm Sunday, June 30 \u2013 Wishing Well \u2013 9pm Kings Of Leon You can never play too many shows in the UK, right? (Picture: Buda Mendes/Getty Images,) Musicians simply being in the UK during June is enough to spark Glastonbury rumours \u2013 just ask Kings Of Leon. The quartet are on our shores on Sunday, June 30 for their British Summer Time show, with fans reckoning they could fit in a cheeky Worthy Farm appearance while here. It has been 20 years since the Sex On Fire rockers first performed at Glasto, with their last set at the festival taking place in 2008 when they headlined. Green Day Could Green Day make their Glastonbury debut? (Picture: Ricardo Rubio/Europa Press via Getty Images) Green Day seems an unlikely band to perform at this year\u2019s Glastonbury, given their set to rock Isle of Wight this month as a \u2018festival exclusive\u2019. However, many fans of the punk band pointed out they released their brand new album Saviors earlier this year \u2013 what better time to play the new tracks? The trio \u2013 fronted by Billie Joe Armstrong \u2013 have never played the legendary UK festival, so it would also be their debut should it happen. Who do you think will play secret sets at Glastonbury Festival 2024?Comment Now The XX AUSTIN, TX \u2013 OCTOBER 13: Musician Romy Madley Croft and Jamie xx of The xx perform onstage during weekend two, day one of Austin City Limits Music Festival at Zilker Park on October 13, 2017 in Austin, Texas. (Photo by Rick Kern/WireImage) The XX surprising fans with a comeback set at Glastonbury seems the most likely given the evidence. Drummer and keyboard player Jamie XX is headlining the Woodies stage on Friday night, while vocalist and guitarist Romy Madley Croft is playing a DJ set on the same day at the Levels area. Despite being quiet over recent years, Romy did confirm in January that the band had been in the studio recording \u2013 so this year\u2019s Glasto could be the perfect time to debut it. The XX has played the festival twice \u2013 firstly in 2010, and then again in 2017.

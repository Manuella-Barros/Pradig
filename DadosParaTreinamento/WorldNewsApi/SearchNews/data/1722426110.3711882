The waiting passengers comprised elderly people, mostly women. Some had been waiting for at least half an hour, others longer, in the sun. As the last passenger boarded the bus, the head count was 35 women, five men. Being a big bus, the passengers easily chose their seats. The bus departed at 9.40 am via the Priority Bus Route and on reaching the Beetham area, the driver applied brakes, left his seat, strolled to the middle of the isle and announced that he was late, because he had to clean get rid of the litter left by schoolchildren on his earlier trip. He told the elderly people to obey the no eating, no drinking, no smoking sign. And he warned that those who did not comply would be forced to exit the bus. However, there was no one was eating, drinking or smoking. After the driver returned to his seat, a young man voiced his displeasure at the \"targeting\" of elderly people by the driver and not using his discretion. I believe the driver's statement should have been made before the journey began. I thank the Government for the buses. However, it is stressful for our senior citizens \u2013 pensioners and disabled people \u2013 to have to wait long periods for buses at stations and sheds. The PTSC must do better and treat the elderly with respect.

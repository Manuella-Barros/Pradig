The FDA has recalled 28 beverages so far in 2024, The Daily Mail reported. All but four of the drinks were recalled because they had drugs, bacteria or harmful chemicals in them that the company didn\u2019t disclose. The recalled drinks include a pain-relieving tea called Himalayan pain relief tea, which didn\u2019t disclose an anti-inflammatory medication ingredient on its label. Martinelli\u2019s Apple Juice was also recalled because it contained arsenic, a toxic metal that may increase the risk of bladder and skin cancer. Around 1.9 million bottles of Fiji Water, made by Natural Waters of Viti Limited, were recalled after three types of bacteria were found in the water in addition to the mineral manganese, which in high amounts can cause brain damage. And just recently, four drinks produced by Charles Boggini Company called Pink Lemonade, Yellow Lemonade and Yellow Lemonade X, as well as the flavoring Cola Flavoring Base were recalled over food dyes linked to cancer risk. Those dyes, which were not disclosed by the company as an ingredient, include Red40 and Yellow 5. The dyes have benzidine, which is carcinogenic to humans and animals. The Cola Flavoring contained undeclared sulfites, preservatives that can cause allergic skin reactions, digestive issues, and asthma in people with sulfite sensitivity, according to Cleveland Clinic. A former FDA and USDA advisor and food safety expert at Northeastern University in Boston said that drinks are sometimes sold to the public before proper checks are done on them. \u201cThere are a lot of drinks that have been scrutinized of late and a lot of it has to do with labeling and undeclared ingredients,\u201d Dr. Detwiler told the Daily Mail. The FDA faces pressure to crack down on food and beverage companies, Detwiler explained.

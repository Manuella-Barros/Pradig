The program, announced Monday, is part of the fast-growing market for longevity and wellness, where the fields of medicine, biotech, fitness and nutrition are merging in the quest to slow the effects of aging.\n\n\"It's really a paradigm shift in how we're able to live with vitality and avoid suffering,\" said Jonathan Swerdlin, co-founder of Function Health. \"It deals with what's above the surface, your abs and glutes, which you can see in the mirror that are great. But it also deals with what's below the surface and what you can't see in the mirror. And that's revolutionary.\"\n\nThe Optimize program starts with a battery of tests. Function Health will test members for 100 biomarkers -- everything from heart, liver and kidney health to metabolic and immune systems to cancer markers and nutrients. Equinox will then run its own battery of fitness tests, including VO2 max, strength and movement range. The tests are repeated twice a year.\n\nAn Equinox \"concierge\" pulls all the tests and data together and helps the member design a personalized plan to improve their overall health and fitness. Each member will have a core team that includes a fitness trainer, a nutrition coach and sleep coach as well as a massage therapist.\n\nThe Optimize membership includes three, 60-minute training sessions per week with a top-level trainer. It also includes two half-hour sessions a month with a nutrition coach, two half-hour sessions a month with a sleep coach and one massage therapy session per month. In all, the program amounts to 16 hours a month of coaching and training, according to Equinox.\n\n\"It's the same as Formula One or an athlete, where you are given a team of top experts in all these different verticals, to design a program based on all the data that we collected,\" said Julia Klim, vice president of strategic partnerships and business development at Equinox.\n\nThe move will mark a major test of Equinox's continued efforts to expand beyond fitness into the broader health and wellness business, which has become a booming market among the affluent.\n\nThe company recently closed a new $1.8 billion funding round that refinances $1.2 billion in existing debt. It said its performance last month made for its second-best April in company history.\n\nEquinox is planning to open new clubs in Philadelphia and the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles later this year, bringing its total locations in the pipeline to 27. The company currently operates 107 locations globally, according to its website.\n\nKlim said Equinox has always focused on \"the four pillars\" of longevity: movement, regeneration, nutrition and community.\n\n\"I sometimes joke that we've always been in the longevity business and the science is catching up,\" she said.\n\nThe new program will cost $3,000 a month for a minimum of six months. The fee doesn't include an Equinox gym membership, which brings the total to about $40,000 or more for the year.\n\n\"It's a human-first, highly luxury service meets data meets coaching program,\" Klim said.\n\nThe Optimize program will initially be available starting at the end of May in New York City and Highland Park, Texas, and will eventually roll out to other states, according to Equinox.

Here's what it includes", "body": "Equinox fitness is largely known for two things: being a luxury wellness brand and having sky-high prices. This week it's leaning into both with the announcement of a new personalized longevity program, Optimize by Equinox, that'll deliver members a range of in-depth assessments and guidance -- to the tune of $40,000 a year.\n\n\"Equinox has always been known to anticipate consumer needs and to come up with programs to support them,\" Julia Klim, vice president of strategic partnerships and business development for Equinox, tells Fortune. She notes that the company started hearing reports on the ground about their members -- \"educated consumers who like to push performance to the next level\" -- sharing blood-test results with their trainers as a way of seeking personalized ways to adjust their workouts and nutrition.\n\n\"We thought, if we know the future of coaching and performance is personalized, then let's partner with the best company and physicians out there,\" says Klim. So the program is being offered in partnership with Function Health, a personal health-management platform that includes access to over 100 lab tests, cofounded by internationally known physician, best-selling author, and podcaster Dr. Mark Hyman.\n\nKlim likens the new approach to that of top athletes, who typically work with a team of people to help them achieve optimal performance. \"There's a doctor, a nutritionist, a sleep coach, a mental performance coach, and they come together as a team,\" she says. \"So, it's data, but a human-led approach.\"\n\nAnd athletes, she notes, don't only have to be fitness pros. \"CEOs are athletes, musicians are athletes ... We attract the consumer who wants to bring more energy and vitality to their performance,\" she says. \"Coaching by designing around movement, nutrition, and regeneration is something we have been doing for years and are now essentially upleveling it.\"\n\nThe program goes live at the end of the month in New York and Texas (with new markets being added throughout the year), where a personal \"concierge\" will guide interested members through filling out medical questionnaires; doing diagnostics around movement, nutrition, and sleep to establish baselines; and getting lab tests for more than 100 biomarkers (regarding the heart, thyroid, hormones, metabolic, inflammation, kidney, liver, nutrients, and more) up to four times a year. Other benefits include personal training with Equinox's most experienced coaches three times a week, twice monthly nutritional coaching and sleep coaching, an Oura Rest & Recovery Kit, and monthly massage therapy.\n\nIt all costs $3,000 a month, with a required six-month commitment -- on top of the average $300 monthly base gym membership (which varies by market) -- adding up to the $40,000 annual total.\n\nRegarding the price point, Kilm stresses it allows members to interact \"with a top expert in any of the categories for roughly 16 hours a month.\"\n\nEquinox's move is not surprising to Beth McGroarty, vice president of research for the Global Wellness Institute, a research-based nonprofit that aims to educate public and private sectors about preventative health and wellness -- a global $5.6 trillion economy, according to the organization's 2023 report.\n\n\"Definitely the biggest or most notable trend across the wellness world, globally, is this focus on longevity and healthspan,\" she tells Fortune. \"It's really astounding, the speed at which it's taken off.\"\n\nWith fitness being the No. 1 most evidence-based practice for longevity in the health space, Equinox \"sees an opportunity to take this whole longevity thing to the nth degree,\" she notes. \"It's gym-as-longevity-clinic.\"\n\nMcGroarty points out that Equinox is not the first to move in this direction: Another luxury fitness chain, Life Time, launched the similarly-conceived Miora last year, as have several Australian businesses.\n\n\"It's part super-high-end gym, part MRIs, cryotherapy, lab tests ... Basically these new hybrid models with so much more, many being realized through partnerships with these diagnostic companies,\" as with Equinox and Function Health, she says.\n\nThe trend has even spread into the travel sector, with hotels all over the world, including the Four Seasons, which offers stem cell treatments and biomarker testing, says McGroarty, though she notes that everyday wellness centers are more logical to have in gyms. \"If you're really gungho on this relentless self-optimization and testing, you want to do it in an everyday way,\" she says. \"Also, having a longevity model without fitness doesn't make sense.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Longevity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regeneration (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutritionist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metabolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger_Management", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career_and_Job_Advancement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career and Job Advancement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1043874348-e1715028010407.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543433", "eventUri": "eng-9543433", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The gym was founded in 1991 and operates 107 locations around the world. Membership comes with unlimited group fitness classes and many of the clubs include a spa, boutiques and a snack bar. Access to all gyms worldwide costs $405 per month, with other membership programs starting at $275. Many popular gym memberships are far cheaper -- Planet Fitness offers membership as low as $10 per month and Gold's Gym packages range from $15 to $50.\n\nThe launch of \"Optimize by Equinox\" comes one month after Equinox announced it would partner with Function Health to bring lab tests to the gym, part of the company's push to become an epicenter for all things health and wellness.

His doctors say his medical age is already at least five years younger than his biological age, which he achieved by following an ultra-strict regimen that includes physical fitness, sleep, diet, supplements and seemingly never-ending medical tests. His experiments have included taking blood-plasma donations from his teenage son and attempts to rejuvenate his penis with shockwave therapy, Rolling Stone reported.

The Equinox EV made its public appearance at the event as a prelude to the upcoming launch of the crossover in the Chinese market.\n\nAs Chevrolet's first all-electric vehicle based on the Ultium architecture to debut in China, the Chevy Equinox EV officially introduces the brand's next generation of zero-emission models to the world's largest automotive market and largest hub for electric vehicles globally. SAIC-GM says the Equinox EV will play a leading role in expanding the local production and sales volume of GM's Ultium models.\n\nIn particular, the all-new Chevy Equinox EV debuted at the 2024 Auto China configured with the range-topping RS trim level, which represents the boldest and sportiest finish of the model presented so far. Although it remains basically the same as the North American model, the Equinox EV RS for China is distinguished with a new 20-inch six-spoke wheel design, slightly larger rearview mirrors and clear-finish taillights.\n\nAdditionally, the Chevy Equinox EV RS comes standard with AWD and is powered by an Ultium Drive dual-motor powertrain. The system consists of a front motor producing 143 kW or 192 horsepower and an additional motor on the rear axle that develops another 68 kW or 91 horsepower, for a total combined output of 211 kW or 283 horsepower.\n\nThe all-new Chevy Equinox EV made its official debut and will launch in the coming months in China, where it will be manufactured exclusively to supply the domestic market and expand Chevrolet's offering of zero-emission models in that country.

This week it's leaning into both with the announcement of a new personalized longevity program, Optimize by Equinox, that'll deliver members a range of in-depth assessments and guidance -- to the tune of $40,000 a year.\n\n\"Equinox has always been known to anticipate consumer needs and to come up with programs to support them,\" Julia Klim, vice president of strategic partnerships and business development for Equinox, tells Fortune. She notes that the company started hearing reports on the ground about their members -- \"educated consumers who like to push performance to the next level\" -- sharing blood-test results with their trainers as a way of seeking personalized ways to adjust their workouts and nutrition.\n\n\"We thought, if we know the future of coaching and performance is personalized, then let's partner with the best company and physicians out there,\" says Klim. So the program is being offered in partnership with Function Health, a personal health-management platform that includes access to over 100 lab tests, cofounded by internationally known physician, best-selling author, and podcaster Dr. Mark Hyman.\n\nKlim likens the new approach to that of top athletes, who typically work with a team of people to help them achieve optimal performance. \"There's a doctor, a nutritionist, a sleep coach, a mental performance coach, and they come together as a team,\" she says. \"So, it's data, but a human-led approach.\"\n\nAnd athletes, she notes, don't only have to be fitness pros. \"CEOs are athletes, musicians are athletes ... We attract the consumer who wants to bring more energy and vitality to their performance,\" she says. \"Coaching by designing around movement, nutrition, and regeneration is something we have been doing for years and are now essentially upleveling it.\"\n\nThe program goes live at the end of the month in New York and Texas (with new markets being added throughout the year), where a personal \"concierge\" will guide interested members through filling out medical questionnaires; doing diagnostics around movement, nutrition, and sleep to establish baselines; and getting lab tests for more than 100 biomarkers (regarding the heart, thyroid, hormones, metabolic, inflammation, kidney, liver, nutrients, and more) up to four times a year. Other benefits include personal training with Equinox's most experienced coaches three times a week, twice monthly nutritional coaching and sleep coaching, an Oura Rest & Recovery Kit, and monthly massage therapy.\n\nIt all costs $3,000 a month, with a required six-month commitment -- on top of the average $300 monthly base gym membership (which varies by market) -- adding up to the $40,000 annual total.\n\nRegarding the price point, Kilm stresses it allows members to interact \"with a top expert in any of the categories for roughly 16 hours a month.\"\n\nEquinox's move is not surprising to Beth McGroarty, vice president of research for the Global Wellness Institute, a research-based nonprofit that aims to educate public and private sectors about preventative health and wellness -- a global $5.6 trillion economy, according to the organization's 2023 report.\n\n\"Definitely the biggest or most notable trend across the wellness world, globally, is this focus on longevity and healthspan,\" she tells Fortune. \"It's really astounding, the speed at which it's taken off.\"\n\nWith fitness being the No. 1 most evidence-based practice for longevity in the health space, Equinox \"sees an opportunity to take this whole longevity thing to the nth degree,\" she notes. \"It's gym-as-longevity-clinic.\"\n\nMcGroarty points out that Equinox is not the first to move in this direction: Another luxury fitness chain, Life Time, launched the similarly-conceived Miora last year, as have several Australian businesses.\n\n\"It's part super-high-end gym, part MRIs, cryotherapy, lab tests ... Basically these new hybrid models with so much more, many being realized through partnerships with these diagnostic companies,\" as with Equinox and Function Health, she says.\n\nThe trend has even spread into the travel sector, with hotels all over the world, including the Four Seasons, which offers stem cell treatments and biomarker testing, says McGroarty, though she notes that everyday wellness centers are more logical to have in gyms. \"If you're really gungho on this relentless self-optimization and testing, you want to do it in an everyday way,\" she says. \"Also, having a longevity model without fitness doesn't make sense.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Longevity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regeneration (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutritionist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metabolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger_Management", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career_and_Job_Advancement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career and Job Advancement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1043874348-e1715028010407.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543433", "eventUri": "eng-9543433", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 452725903, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 9, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 9}}}

Next season the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves will play a game at Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, one of NASCAR's most iconic venues, dubbed as the MLB Speedway Classic '25. The league announced the plans on Friday, setting the date for Saturday, Aug. 2, 2025.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" MLB Commisioner Rob Manfred said. \"The Reds and the Braves form an ideal matchup because of their dynamic talent and the proximity of their markets. We look forward to celebrating our game with a wide array of fans, both on and off the field throughout the weekend, and highlighting the rich traditions of sports, music and community in Tennessee and across the region.\"\n\nThe Reds will serve as the home team, with them also hosting two games in Cincinnati prior to the Speedway Classic. (Sunday will be observed as an off day for both clubs.)\n\nBristol Motor Speedway is located near the Tennessee/Virginia state line and about 90 miles north of Asheville, North Carolina. It seats approximately 150,000 fans for NASCAR events and has rarely hosted non-motorsport events. In 2016, Tennessee and Virginia Tech played a college football game on the infield that drew 156,990 fans, a record for an NCAA football game. MLB.com noted that the \"baseball diamond will be built across the track and infield of the legendary speedway.\"\n\nHere's what the diamond will look like inside the venue:\n\nIn addition to international games (London, South Korea, etc.), MLB has also played games at unique venues in the United States in recent years. Here are some recent examples:\n\nJune 20, 2024: St. Louis Cardinals vs. San Francisco Giants at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, AlabamaAug. 12, 2021 and Aug. 11, 2022: Field of Dreams Game in Dyersville, IowaJuly 3, 2019: Braves vs. Miami Marlins at Fort BraggJune 13, 2019: Detroit Tigers vs. Kansas City Royals in Omaha, Nebraska\n\nThe Little League Classic has been played annually since 2017 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. This year's game will feature the Tigers and New York Yankees on Aug. 18.\n\nAs non-division rivals, the Braves and Reds are scheduled to play two series in 2025: May 5-8 in Atlanta and Aug. 1-3 in Cincinnati/Bristol.\n\nThe largest crowd ever for an MLB game is 115,300 for an exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on March 29, 2008. It is the only MLB game ever with more than 100,000 people in attendance.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bill Lee, on hand at the track for the announcement, said Bristol is an iconic venue that has hosted pro and college football in its past, along with some of the most exciting NASCAR races on its 0.533-mile oval.\n\n\"History will be made when you have a special game here,\" Lee said.\n\nThe game will be the first National League or American League regular-season game played in the Volunteer State and continues MLB's push to break new ground. There have been major league games in recent seasons at MLB at Fort Bragg in 2016, MLB in Omaha in 2019, MLB at Field of Dreams in 2021, and MLB at Rickwood Field earlier this year.\n\nThose games were the first NL/AL contests in North Carolina, Nebraska, Iowa and Alabama.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, also on hand for the announcement.\n\nJones, who played his entire big league career with the Braves, was wowed thinking about a game at Bristol.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see an infield of a NASCAR track, especially this one, knowing all these haulers are packed here like sardines,\" said Jones, elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nElliott, the 2020 Cup Series champion and a big Braves fan, drove the Atlanta car for a few laps, dueling racing competitor Chastain in the Cincinnati car.\n\nElliott won an All-Star race at Bristol in 2020 and wants to come back in a year for the game. \"I just hope I can make it,\" said Elliott, the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nThat might be a big ask since NASCAR is likely running that August weekend, although the schedule has yet to be announced.\n\nHarvick, the Hall of Famer, had no doubt that fans who fill the stands for racing will be just as supportive when the Reds and Braves arrive.\n\nHarvick remembers the \"Battle of Bristol\" in 2016 when college football powers Tennessee and Virginia Tech played at the track in front of a record 156,990 spectators.\n\n\"I think people are going be surprised at the size of what we would call a short track and now we're going to put a baseball field in the infield,\" Harvick said.", "source": {"uri":

Bill Lee, on hand at the track for the announcement, said Bristol is an iconic venue that has hosted pro and college football in its past, along with some of the most exciting NASCAR races on its 0.533-mile oval.\n\n\"History will be made when you have a special game here,\" Lee said.\n\nThe game will be the first National League or American League regular-season game played in the Volunteer State and continues MLB's push to break new ground. There have been major league games in recent seasons at MLB at Fort Bragg in 2016, MLB in Omaha in 2019, MLB at Field of Dreams in 2021, and MLB at Rickwood Field earlier this year.\n\nThose games were the first NL/AL contests in North Carolina, Nebraska, Iowa and Alabama.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, also on hand for the announcement.\n\nJones, who played his entire big league career with the Braves, was wowed thinking about a game at Bristol.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see an infield of a NASCAR track, especially this one, knowing all these haulers are packed here like sardines,\" said Jones, elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nElliott, the 2020 Cup Series champion and a big Braves fan, drove the Atlanta car for a few laps, dueling racing competitor Chastain in the Cincinnati car.\n\nElliott won an All-Star race at Bristol in 2020 and wants to come back in a year for the game. \"I just hope I can make it,\" said Elliott, the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nThat might be a big ask since NASCAR is likely running that August weekend, although the schedule has yet to be announced.\n\nHarvick, the Hall of Famer, had no doubt that fans who fill the stands for racing will be just as supportive when the Reds and Braves arrive.\n\nHarvick remembers the \"Battle of Bristol\" in 2016 when college football powers Tennessee and Virginia Tech played at the track in front of a record 156,990 spectators.\n\n\"I think people are going be surprised at the size of what we would call a short track and now we're going to put a baseball field in the infield,\" Harvick said.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/preview-774.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795995", "eventUri": "eng-9795995", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Next season the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves will play a game at Bristol Motor Speedway, one of NASCAR's most iconic venues, reports The Athletic. An official announcement is expected later this week.\n\nBristol Motor Speedway is located near the Tennessee/Virginia state line and about 90 miles north of Asheville, North Carolina. It seats approximately 150,000 fans for NASCAR events and has rarely hosted non-motorsport events. In 2016, Tennessee and Virginia Tech played a college football game on the infield that drew 156,990 fans, a record for an NCAA football game.\n\nIn addition to international games (London, South Korea, etc.), MLB has also played games at unique venues in the United States in recent years. Here are some recent examples:\n\nJune 20, 2024: St. Louis Cardinals vs. San Francisco Giants at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, AlabamaAug. 12, 2021 and Aug. 11, 2022: Field of Dreams Game in Dyersville, IowaJuly 3, 2019: Braves vs. Miami Marlins at Fort BraggJune 13, 2019: Detroit Tigers vs. Kansas City Royals in Omaha, Nebraska\n\nThe Little League Classic has been played annually since 2017 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. This year's game will feature the Tigers and New York Yankees on Aug. 18.\n\nAs non-division rivals, the Braves and Reds are scheduled to play two series in 2025: May 5-8 in Atlanta and Aug. 1-3 in Cincinnati. The Braves and Reds both have a scheduled off-day on Friday, July 31, so that Aug. 1 series opener is as good a guess at a date for the Bristol Motor Speedway game as any.\n\nThe largest crowd ever for an MLB game is 115,300 for an exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on March 29, 2008. It is the only MLB game ever with more than 100,000 people in attendance.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It will also be the first in-season Major League Baseball game held in Tennessee.\n\nMajor League Baseball announced Friday that NASCAR's iconic Bristol Motor Speedway will host a regular-season MLB game for the first time next year.\n\nThe game is set for Aug. 2, 2025, between the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds. It will also be the first in-season MLB game to be held in Tennessee.\n\n\"We look forward to celebrating our game with a wide array of fans, both on and off the field throughout the weekend, and highlighting the rich traditions of sports, music and community in Tennessee and across the region,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.\n\nThe Bristol Motor Speedway is one of the largest sporting venues in America with a seating capacity of close to 150,000.\n\nThe game next August is likely to break the single-game attendance record for a Major League Baseball game. In 2008, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosted an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox in front of a crowd of 115,300, setting a Guinness World Record for the largest attendance ever at a baseball game. In comparison, the average MLB ballpark can seat between 40,000 to 45,000 fans.\n\nThis announcement comes as Major League Baseball makes a renewed to expand the game to new venues and fans across the United States and globally. The MLB has hosted games in many nontraditional ballparks, including in 2016 when a game was held on an active military base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, or in 2021 when the Chicago White Sox played the New York Yankees on the iconic \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa. And as recently as June, the league hosted the \"MLB at Rickwood Field: A Tribute to the Negro Leagues\" in Birmingham, Alabama, two days after the death of Hall of Famer Willie Mays.\n\nThe MLB has also outlined a schedule of ambitious international games, including playing in cities such as Tokyo, Mexico City, Paris, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, all in the 2025 season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bristol Motor Speedway is no stranger to high-profile non-NASCAR events. The track hosted an NFL exhibition game in 1961. In 2016, Tennessee and Virginia Tech played in the \"Battle at Bristol\" on a purpose-built field in the infield that drew 156,990 fans, the largest crowd ever to watch an NCAA football game.\n\nAtlanta Braves third baseman Austin Riley told The Athletic, which was the first to report this news Tuesday, \"You see all this stuff, teams traveling (abroad), change it up a little bit.

the Negro American League's history and became a tribute to legendary Giants center fielder Willie Mays, who died two days before.\n\nThe Cardinals ended up coming out victorious defeating the Giants

The MLB has hosted games in many nontraditional ballparks, including in 2016 when a game was held on an active military base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina and in 2021, when they had the Chicago White Sox play the New York Yankees on the iconic \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa.\n\nIn June, the league hosted the \"MLB at Rickwood Field: A Tribute to the Negro Leagues\" in Birmingham, Alabama, two days after the death of Hall of Famer, Willie Mays.\n\nAdditionally, the MLB has slated multiple international cities to host games that include Tokyo, Mexico City, Paris, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, all in the 2025 season.\n\nThe Bristol Motor Speedway has hosted other events in the past, such as an NFL exhibition game in 1961. In 2016, Tennessee and Virginia Tech played in the \"Battle at Bristol\" that had 156,990 fans in attendance, which brought in the largest crowd ever to watch an NCAA football game.\n\nStay informed!

Bill Lee, on hand at the track for the announcement, said Bristol is an iconic venue that has hosted pro and college football in its past, along with some of the most exciting NASCAR races on its 0.533-mile oval.\n\n\"History will be made when you have a special game here,\" Lee said.\n\nThe game will be the first National League or American League regular-season game played in the Volunteer State and continues MLB's push to break new ground. There have been major league games in recent seasons at MLB at Fort Bragg in 2016, MLB in Omaha in 2019, MLB at Field of Dreams in 2021, and MLB at Rickwood Field earlier this year.\n\nThose games were the first NL/AL contests in North Carolina, Nebraska, Iowa and Alabama.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, also on hand for the announcement.\n\nJones, who played his entire big league career with the Braves, was wowed thinking about a game at Bristol.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see an infield of a NASCAR track, especially this one, knowing all these haulers are packed here like sardines,\" said Jones, elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nElliott, the 2020 Cup Series champion and a big Braves fan, drove the Atlanta car for a few laps, dueling racing competitor Chastain in the Cincinnati car.\n\nElliott won an All-Star race at Bristol in 2020 and wants to come back in a year for the game. \"I just hope I can make it,\" said Elliott, the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nThat might be a big ask since NASCAR is likely running that August weekend, although the schedule has yet to be announced.\n\nHarvick, the Hall of Famer, had no doubt that fans who fill the stands for racing will be just as supportive when the Reds and Braves arrive.\n\nHarvick remembers the \"Battle of Bristol\" in 2016 when college football powers Tennessee and Virginia Tech played at the track in front of a record 156,990 spectators.\n\n\"I think people are going be surprised at the size of what we would call a short track and now we're going to put a baseball field in the infield,\" Harvick said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Officials from MLB and the track known...\n\nFasten your seat belts, Major League Baseball is coming to Bristol Motor Speedway.\n\nOfficials from MLB and the track known as the \"Thunder Valley\" that holds more than 146,000 fans for NASCAR races announced Friday that the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds will play in the Speedway Classic there on Aug. 2, 2025.\n\nAn outline of where the field will be next summer was laid out on Bristol's infield with replica NASCAR machines, one with Atlanta's logo and the other with Cincinnati's logo.\n\nHall of Famer Chipper Jones of Atlanta threw out a ceremonial first pitch alongside NASCAR Hall of Famer Kevin Harvick, while Reds great Eric Davis was joined by racers Chase Elliott and Ross Chastain for their throw.\n\nIt will be a Reds home game with the first two being played at Cincinnati.\n\nMajor League Baseball has sought out and played games in different locations like the Field of Dreams games in Iowa, earlier this year in Birmingham, Alabama, to celebrate Negro League baseball and overseas in London the past several years.\n\nBristol, located in northeastern Tennessee on the state's border with Virginia, fits into that mission and gives those who can't always get to a baseball game a chance to see how the game has evolved, said Jeremiah Yolkut, MLB vice president of global events.\n\n\"To be able to bring the game here to Bristol and create storylines that tie into a faster paced game, high energy and big moments, this is the stage that we want to put that on,\" Yolkut said.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee, on hand at the track for the announcement, said Bristol is an iconic venue that has hosted pro and college football in its past, along with some of the most exciting NASCAR races on its 0.533-mile oval.\n\n\"History will be made when you have a special game here,\" Lee said.\n\nThe game will be the first National League or American League regular-season game played in the Volunteer State and continues MLB's push to break new ground. There have been major league games in recent seasons at MLB at Fort Bragg in 2016, MLB in Omaha in 2019, MLB at Field of Dreams in 2021, and MLB at Rickwood Field earlier this year.\n\nThose games were the first NL/AL contests in North Carolina, Nebraska, Iowa and Alabama.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, also on hand for the announcement.\n\nJones, who played his entire big league career with the Braves, was wowed thinking about a game at Bristol.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see an infield of a NASCAR track, especially this one, knowing all these haulers are packed here like sardines,\" said Jones, elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nElliott, the 2020 Cup Series champion and a big Braves fan, drove the Atlanta car for a few laps, dueling racing competitor Chastain in the Cincinnati car.\n\nElliott won an All-Star race at Bristol in 2020 and wants to come back in a year for the game. \"I just hope I can make it,\" said Elliott, the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nThat might be a big ask since NASCAR is likely running that August weekend, although the schedule has yet to be announced.\n\nHarvick, the Hall of Famer, had no doubt that fans who fill the stands for racing will be just as supportive when the Reds and Braves arrive.\n\nHarvick remembers the \"Battle of Bristol\" in 2016 when college football powers Tennessee and Virginia Tech played at the track in front of a record 156,990 spectators.\n\n\"I think people are going be surprised at the size of what we would call a short track and now we're going to put a baseball field in the infield,\" Harvick said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

FOX will televise the historic game with a 7 p.m. ET start for next year's Saturday night event.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said. \"The Reds and the Braves form an ideal matchup because of their dynamic talent and the proximity of their markets.\n\n\"We look forward to celebrating our game with a wide array of fans, both on and off the field throughout the weekend, and highlighting the rich traditions of sports, music and community in Tennessee and across the region.\"\n\nThe record attendance for an MLB game is 115,300, set in March 2008 for an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n\nWhether this event breaks that record (Bristol is not releasing a seating capacity for the game), is difficult to predict for a facility nestled in the Appalachian mountains that typically hosts drivers in race cars circling a high-banked 0.533-mile concrete oval.\n\nNext August, the only things reaching 100 miles an hour at Bristol will be baseballs. The game will serve as the finale of a three-game Reds homestand, with Friday and Saturday in Cincinnati. Sunday, May 3, will be held as a rain date, if needed.\n\nThis will be the first MLB game played in Tennessee, making it the fifth state since 2016 to play host to its first MLB contest.\n\nThe track is located in northeastern Tennessee, about 15 minutes from the unique Bristol main street that serves as the border of Tennessee and Virginia. The Bristol weekend will include live music in an area known for its deep roots in country music.\n\nAlthough the NASCAR schedule is not announced, typically Bristol has its big NASCAR weekends in the spring by mid-April and then again in September, leaving a few months for MLB to construct the field.\n\nMLB will use architectural design company Populous and landscape company BrightView to construct the field, partners it has used in the past for games such as the recent one at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Ala.\n\nBristol will have to make some adjustments to its facility, removing part of its pit road wall and one of the buildings where tires are mounted on the wheels during the race weekend. The field dimensions will be 330 feet down the lines, 400 feet to center and 384 (left-center) and 375 (right-center) in the power alleys.\n\n\"There is deep baseball history in Bristol and around this area, long acknowledged as the heart of the Appalachian League,\" Bristol Motor Speedway general manager Jerry Caldwell said. \"In addition, Bristol's location makes it the perfect meet-in-the-middle destination for a showdown between these two beloved clubs.\"\n\nTicket prices were not announced as of Friday. Braves, Reds and Bristol season-ticket holders will get first access to purchase tickets in September with public ticket sales beginning in December.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seating_capacity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seating capacity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appalachian Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populous (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appalachian League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1408/814/bristol.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795995", "eventUri": "eng-9795995", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-03", "textStart": 1650, "textEnd": 1655}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-03-", "textStart": 1060, "textEnd": 1070}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Bill Lee, on hand at the track for the announcement, said Bristol is an iconic venue that has hosted pro and college football in its past, along with some of the most exciting NASCAR races on its 0.533-mile oval.\n\n\"History will be made when you have a special game here,\" Lee said.\n\nThe game will be the first National League or American League regular-season game played in the Volunteer State and continues MLB's push to break new ground. There have been major league games in recent seasons at MLB at Fort Bragg in 2016, MLB in Omaha in 2019, MLB at Field of Dreams in 2021, and MLB at Rickwood Field earlier this year.\n\nThose games were the first NL/AL contests in North Carolina, Nebraska, Iowa and Alabama.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, also on hand for the announcement.\n\nJones, who played his entire big league career with the Braves, was wowed thinking about a game at Bristol.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see an infield of a NASCAR track, especially this one, knowing all these haulers are packed here like sardines,\" said Jones, elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nElliott, the 2020 Cup Series champion and a big Braves fan, drove the Atlanta car for a few laps, dueling racing competitor Chastain in the Cincinnati car.\n\nElliott won an All-Star race at Bristol in 2020 and wants to come back in a year for the game. \"I just hope I can make it,\" said Elliott, the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nThat might be a big ask since NASCAR is likely running that August weekend, although the schedule has yet to be announced.\n\nHarvick, the Hall of Famer, had no doubt that fans who fill the stands for racing will be just as supportive when the Reds and Braves arrive.\n\nHarvick remembers the \"Battle of Bristol\" in 2016 when college football powers Tennessee and Virginia Tech played at the track in front of a record 156,990 spectators.\n\n\"I think people are going be surprised at the size of what we would call a short track and now we're going to put a baseball field in the infield,\" Harvick said.\n\nAP MLB:

But the facility also recently played host to a NCAA college football contest between the University of Tennessee and Virginia Tech.\n\nThat event drew a crowd of 156,990, a record for the highest attended game in NCAA football history.\n\nThe Redskins and Eagles played at the track back in 1961 as well.\n\nThis is on-brand for Major League Baseball, which has sought to expand the game domestically and internationally, promoting events at the Field of Dreams in Dyersville, Iowa and the Rickwood Field Game in Birmingham, Alabama.

It will also be the first in-season MLB game to be held in Tennessee.\n\n\"We look forward to celebrating our game with a wide array of fans, both on and off the field throughout the weekend, and highlighting the rich traditions of sports, music and community in Tennessee and across the region,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.\n\nThe Bristol Motor Speedway is one of the largest sporting venues in America with a seating capacity of close to 150,000.\n\nThe game next August is likely to break the single-game attendance record for a Major League Baseball game. In 2008, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosted an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox in front of a crowd of 115,300, setting a Guinness World Record for the largest attendance ever at a baseball game. In comparison, the average MLB ballpark can seat between 40,000 to 45,000 fans.\n\nThis announcement comes as Major League Baseball makes a renewed to expand the game to new venues and fans across the United States and globally. The MLB has hosted games in many nontraditional ballparks, including in 2016 when a game was held on an active military base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, or in 2021 when the Chicago White Sox played the New York Yankees on the iconic \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa. And as recently as June, the league hosted the \"MLB at Rickwood Field: A Tribute to the Negro Leagues\" in Birmingham, Alabama, two days after the death of Hall of Famer Willie Mays.\n\nThe MLB has also outlined a schedule of ambitious international games, including playing in cities such as Tokyo, Mexico City, Paris, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, all in the 2025 season.", "source": {"uri":

The Tennessee track, a half-mile oval, hosts two NASCAR events every year.\n\nMore news: Emotional Dodgers All-Star Back After Tending to 3-Year-Old Son's Illness\n\nMLB declined to comment for the report.\n\nBristol Motor Speedway opened in 1961, making it older than most current MLB venues.\n\nKnown as \"The Last Great Colosseum,\" Bristol Motor Speedway bills itself as \"a versatile multi-use venue that hosts major auto races, football games, concerts and many other captivating events.\"\n\nUnlike the \"Field of Dreams\" game in Aug. 2021 and the Rickwood Field game earlier this year, Bristol is already a modernized venue replete with the usual 21st-century trappings fans are accustomed to: \"man cave suites,\" drinking areas, and a state-of-the art sound system.\n\nIt's also the record-holder for the largest spectator attendance at a college football game -- 159,990 for a Tennessee-Virginia Tech game in 2016. Capacity for NASCAR events is 146,000.\n\nWhat will be fascinating is how MLB adapts the dimensions of the venue for baseball. Events at ovular coliseums are rare. The Los Angeles Dodgers played their first home games at the Los Angeles Coliseum because Dodger Stadium had not yet been built when the franchise relocated from Brooklyn.\n\nIn order to accommodate a baseball field, a 40-foot high net was erected above the Coliseum's short left-field wall. Its distance from home plate: 250 feet.\n\nThe Bristol track has a long history of adapting to different sports. According to The Athletic:\n\nIn addition to building a football field inside Bristol to host the Volunteers and Hokies, (CEO Marcus) Smith also brought dirt in to completely cover Bristol's concrete racing surface in 2021 so that his track could host NASCAR's first premier series race on dirt since 1970.

The sport has also recently sponsored a number of \"special\" international contests, having played regular season games in London, Mexico City, Tokyo and Seoul.\n\nMore Information Motorsports NASCAR", "source": {"uri": "autoblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Autoblog"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_williams@autoblog.com", "name": "Stephen Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedway_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speedway Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seating_capacity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seating capacity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://edgecast-img.yahoo.net/mysterio/api/22D7011B59144A0D605990523DC061B8EE7AFB8108348736B942FF76784815C0/autoblog/resizefill_w1200_h675;quality_85;format_webp;cc_31536000;/https://s.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1200x675/format/jpg/quality/100/http://s.aolcdn.com/commerce/blogcdn/www.autoblog.com/media/2010/06/lat-webb-ford1000-255.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795995", "eventUri": "eng-9795995", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 617, "textEnd": 625}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-03-29", "textStart": 1120, "textEnd": 1134}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)\n\nBristol, located in northeastern Tennessee on the state's border with Virginia, fits into that mission and gives those who can't always get to a baseball game a chance to see how the game has evolved, said Jeremiah Yolkut, MLB vice president of global events.\n\n\"To be able to bring the game here to Bristol and create storylines that tie into a faster paced game, high energy and big moments, this is the stage that we want to put that on,\" Yolkut said.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee, on hand at the track for the announcement, said Bristol is an iconic venue that has hosted pro and college football in its past, along with some of the most exciting NASCAR races on its 0.533-mile oval.\n\n\"History will be made when you have a special game here,\" Lee said.\n\nThe game will be the first National League or American League regular-season game played in the Volunteer State and continues MLB's push to break new ground. There have been major league games in recent seasons at MLB at Fort Bragg in 2016, MLB in Omaha in 2019, MLB at Field of Dreams in 2021, and MLB at Rickwood Field earlier this year.\n\nThose games were the first NL/AL contests in North Carolina, Nebraska, Iowa and Alabama.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, also on hand for the announcement.\n\nJones, who played his entire big league career with the Braves, was wowed thinking about a game at Bristol.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see an infield of a NASCAR track, especially this one, knowing all these haulers are packed here like sardines,\" said Jones, elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nElliott, the 2020 Cup Series champion and a big Braves fan, drove the Atlanta car for a few laps, dueling racing competitor Chastain in the Cincinnati car.\n\nElliott won an All-Star race at Bristol in 2020 and wants to come back in a year for the game. \"I just hope I can make it,\" said Elliott, the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nThat might be a big ask since NASCAR is likely running that August weekend, although the schedule has yet to be announced.\n\nHarvick, the Hall of Famer, had no doubt that fans who fill the stands for racing will be just as supportive when the Reds and Braves arrive.\n\nHarvick remembers the \"Battle of Bristol\" in 2016 when college football powers Tennessee and Virginia Tech played at the track in front of a record 156,990 spectators.\n\n\"I think people are going be surprised at the size of what we would call a short track and now we're going to put a baseball field in the infield,\" Harvick said.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nAP NASCAR: https://apnews.com/hub/nascar-racing\n\nCincinnati Reds' Elly De La Cruz (44) and Spencer Steer (7) celebrate at the end of the 10 inning of a baseball game against the Miami Marlins, Thursday, Aug. 8, 2024, in Miami.

The stadium seats 146,000 fans for races, though for special events that number can vary. In 2016, the Tennessee Volunteers played Virginia Tech in a college football game on the track's infield. The 156,990 fans at the game made it the highest-attended college football game ever.\n\nThe track also hosted an NFL exhibition game in 1961 between Washington and the Philadelphia Eagles, and an FCS football game in 2016 between East Tennessee State and Western Carolina.\n\nMLB adds Bristol Motor Speedway to its list of special events sites\n\nSince Rob Manfred became MLB commissioner in 2015, the game has begun traveling outside of its current footprint to host special events. A game at Bristol will be next on the list.\n\nIn 2019, the Yankees and Red Sox played in the first MLB London Series at London Stadium. The series returned in 2023 (Cubs vs. Cardinals) and 2024 (Mets vs. Phillies).\n\nIn 2021, MLB also hosted the Field of Dreams game in Iowa next to the actual field from the hit 1989 movie. That game returned in 2022, before construction prevented the series from continuing. Instead, the Giants and Cardinals played at Birmingham, Alabama's Rickwood Field in 2024 as a tribute to the Negro Leagues and former Giant Willie Mays, who passed away just days before the game was played.\n\nBeyond the United States, MLB has hosted regular season games in Mexico City, Tokyo, and Seoul.\n\nMLB's next special events game will be on August 18, when the Yankees and Tigers play in

How will that work?", "body": "Sorry, a summary is not available for this article at this time. Please try again later.\n\nAs potential baseball venues go, a NASCAR track located four hours from any current major league city is not the most intuitive target. But a major motor speedway will hold a major league baseball game all the same. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced Friday that the Atlanta Braves will play the Cincinnati Reds at Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tenn., on Aug. 2, 2025, on a field built across the infield and track of one of NASCAR's most treasured and historic venues.\n\n\"If you look around here, or if you look online at what Bristol Motor Speedway is, it truly is a coliseum,\" MLB Vice President of Global Events Jeremiah Yokult said at a news conference Friday morning. \"And we felt when we walked into this place several years ago and we looked at it, that there was no better stage to consider putting on a large-scale event that would bring baseball onto the infield of a racetrack to further bring out what's so great about baseball.\"\n\nBristol Motor Speedway is located just south of the border between Virginia and Tennessee, a relative dead zone for Major League Baseball. The Braves (272 miles south) and Reds (302 miles northwest) are the teams whose homes are nearest the facility, with the Washington Nationals roughly 390 miles to the northeast.\n\nSignificantly, the facility is also within driving distance of Nashville, one of the primary contenders to be awarded a team when MLB next expands.\n\nMLB has long scheduled showcase games abroad. London trips are regular occurrences. The San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres played a series in Mexico City last year. The Los Angeles Dodgers and Padres opened this regular season in Seoul, and the Dodgers and Chicago Cubs will open in Tokyo next year.\n\nBut in recent years, MLB has expanded its portfolio of domestic showcase games, playing the Field of Dreams games in Iowa and, most recently, playing a regular season game in June at historic Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Ala., to celebrate the legacy of Negro League players.\n\nIn some ways, then, Bristol Motor Speedway does not fit the pattern. It is not a landmark of baseball culture, such as Dyersville, Iowa, or a significant stage for baseball history, such as Rickwood. But it is different, and MLB officials have been adamant about the need to reach new groups with the game.\n\n\"What special event games do for us, when we bring them to different locales across the globe, is we're really able to amplify what baseball means to local communities and the storylines we're able to tell,\" Yokult said. \"... There are folks that don't always get to go to one of our 30 major league ballparks. So the idea is we can bring that product to places like Tennessee where it's very baseball rich, but they don't have the opportunity to see major league baseball all the time.\"\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee said he expects \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" of economic boost from the event, which he called \"a big showcase for us.\" Indeed, if interest is high, plenty of fans will have the chance to attend. When it is configured for racing, Bristol Motor Speedway holds 146,000 people. When it hosted a college football game between locals Virginia Tech and Tennessee in 2016, it held 156,990.\n\nExactly how many people will be able to see the Reds and Braves next year remains to be seen, though early renderings of the setup suggest the part of the historic oval behind home plate will not be available for seating, with a smaller number of seats installed at ground level surrounding home plate.\n\nThe field itself has to be positioned just to the right of the massive several-sided hanging screen they call \"Colossus\" to avoid any batted balls hitting the board. Some low walls around the track will be removed, and thousands of tons of gravel will be brought into the infield and pit areas to create a surface level enough for major league field standards. The foul poles will be 330 feet from home plate down both lines, and center field will be 400 feet from home plate.\n\nIn terms of baseball scheduling logistics, the Saturday night game will count as a home game for the Reds and will be played after Thursday and Friday games between the teams in Cincinnati. Both teams will have a scheduled day off Sunday to allow the game to be rescheduled in case of inclement weather.\n\nThe game will be part of a much bigger weekend, one that will also include nods to Bristol's heritage as \"the birthplace of country music\" -- making for a far less baseball-centric event than other showcase games played at, for example, the home of the College World Series in Omaha in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chelsea_janes@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Chelsea Janes", "type":

In 2022, Governor Lee partnered with the General Assembly to appropriate $25 million in the state budget for a fund designed to attract and retain high-profile events that deliver significant economic impact, create jobs, and showcase the state to a global audience. The Special Event Fund is a competitive, incentive-based grant program tied to measurable performance outcomes. Eligible events will generate direct economic impact greater than $10 million, and a net economic benefit of at least $1 million in state tax revenue.\n\n\"We are home to the best sports fans in the nation, and now they -- along with thousands of fans from around the globe -- will get to experience Major League Baseball here for the very first time,\" said Commissioner Mark Ezell, Tennessee Department of Tourist Development. \"This is a home run for Tennessee residents and visitors.

Bill Lee, on hand at the track for the announcement, said Bristol is an iconic venue that has hosted pro and college football in its past, along with some of the most exciting NASCAR races on its 0.533-mile oval.\n\n\"History will be made when you have a special game here,\" Lee said.\n\nThe game will be the first National League or American League regular-season game played in the Volunteer State and continues MLB's push to break new ground. There have been major league games in recent seasons at MLB at Fort Bragg in 2016, MLB in Omaha in 2019, MLB at Field of Dreams in 2021, and MLB at Rickwood Field earlier this year.\n\nThose games were the first NL/AL contests in North Carolina, Nebraska, Iowa and Alabama.\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever,\" said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, also on hand for the announcement.\n\nJones, who played his entire big league career with the Braves, was wowed thinking about a game at Bristol.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see an infield of a NASCAR track, especially this one, knowing all these haulers are packed here like sardines,\" said Jones, elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nElliott, the 2020 Cup Series champion and a big Braves fan, drove the Atlanta car for a few laps, dueling racing competitor Chastain in the Cincinnati car.\n\nElliott won an All-Star race at Bristol in 2020 and wants to come back in a year for the game. \"I just hope I can make it,\" said Elliott, the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nThat might be a big ask since NASCAR is likely running that August weekend, although the schedule has yet to be announced.\n\nHarvick, the Hall of Famer, had no doubt that fans who fill the stands for racing will be just as supportive when the Reds and Braves arrive.\n\nHarvick remembers the \"Battle of Bristol\" in 2016 when college football powers Tennessee and Virginia Tech played at the track in front of a record 156,990 spectators.\n\n\"I think people are going be surprised at the size of what we would call a short track and now we're going to put a baseball field in the infield,\" Harvick said.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nAP NASCAR: https://apnews.com/hub/nascar-racing\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Don't worry, NASCAR isn't running a race in the middle of a Los Angeles Dodgers game. Major League Baseball announced on Friday that Bristol Motor Speedway will host the MLB Speedway Classic, a regular-season game between the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds in 2025.\n\nThe high-banked half-mile short track in Eastern Tennessee first hosted the NASCAR Cup Series in 1961 and remains a schedule staple. A typical race weekend sees team haulers shuffled into the infield door-to-door like a game of Tetris. Next year's August 5 matchup will see the infield transformed into a ballpark with the speedway's suspended jumbotron dangling outside of the left field foul line over a grandstand.\n\nLiving up to the venue's nickname, \"The Last Great Coliseum,\" MLB's goal is likely to fill as many of Bristol's 146,000 seats as possible. However, the event's renderings show a pretty dull field configuration despite baseball's rules allowing for extremely quirky dimensions. I want to see the outfielders contending with the 24-degree banking to catch fly balls. I want to see the catch fence as part of the outfield wall.\n\nRob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball and contender for most-hated man in sports, said in statement:\n\n\"Major League Baseball is excited to deliver a special game at Bristol Motor Speedway, a unique setting that sports fans will remember forever. The Reds and the Braves form an ideal matchup because of their dynamic talent and the proximity of their markets. We look forward to celebrating our game with a wide array of fans, both on and off the field throughout the weekend, and highlighting the rich traditions of sports, music and community in Tennessee and across the region.\"\n\nProfessional sports leagues are always looking for a new spectacle, but there has been an uptick in recent years. NASCAR moved the Busch Clash to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. For its part, MLB plays a two-game regular-season series in London.\n\nThe inspiration for the Speedway Classic was the Battle at Bristol, a college football game between Tennessee and Virginia Tech. The 2016 event shattered records with 156,990 fans in attendance. The game's success was attributed to the race track being a natural neutral site near the Tennessee-Virginia state line, the South's love for college football and the season is only 12 games longer. Only time will tell if the baseball fans will flock to the speedway next year.", "source": {"uri": "jalopnik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jalopnik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_car_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock car racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedway,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speedway, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Speedway, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbotron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jumbotron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_track_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval track racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandstand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grandstand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Light_Clash_at_The_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Busch Light Clash at The Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/59d054610aa2ac15ff9105031f0d2ff2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795995", "eventUri": "eng-9795995", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 624, "textEnd": 632}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Huge ratings, and a walk-off win gave MLB a huge win, and the league went back in 2022 when the Reds and Cubs faced off.\n\nThis season MLB paid homage to the Negro Leagues when the Cardinals and Giants faced off at Rickwood Field in Alabama, home site of the Negro League Birmingham Barons.\n\nBristol Motor Speedway has a press conference announced for Friday, Aug. 9.", "source": {"uri": "b105country.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "B105"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2024/08/attachment-Jared-C.-Tilton-2.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795995", "eventUri": "eng-9795995", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1440, "textEnd": 1446}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Circle Aug. 2 of next year on your calendar for a matchup between the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds that won't take place at Truist Park or the Great American Ball Park -- or, actually, at any baseball stadium. Instead, NASCAR announced Friday that the 2025 game will go down at Tennessee's Bristol Motor Speedway, with NBC News noting it's the first time that a NASCAR track will host a regular-season MLB game.\n\nIt will also be the first regular-season MLB game to take place in the Volunteer State. \"We look forward to celebrating our game with a wide array of fans, both on and off the field throughout the weekend, and highlighting the rich traditions of sports, music, and community in Tennessee and across the region,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. The track has hosted college football games before -- two back-to-back events in 2016, the first between the University of Tennessee and Virginia Tech, and the next a week later between East Tennessee State and Western Carolina.\n\nEven the NFL has waded into Bristol waters, with an exhibition game played there in 1961 between Philly and Washington. The track can seat nearly 150,000; for context, the average MLB arena can squeeze in 40,000 to 45,000. Fox Sports notes the league hasn't released a seating capacity for this particular game, but there's already buzz going that the crowd could set a Guinness record for largest attendance at a baseball game. Currently, that honor sits with Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which in 2008 saw 115,300 people show up to watch an exhibition game between the LA Dodgers and Boston Red Sox.

It's the first regular-season MLB game in Tennessee.\n\nThe smell of peanuts and crackerjacks will meet rubber and fuel at the speedway's famous short track as crews build an entire baseball field, outfield dugouts and stands. Gov. Bill Lee, a Braves fan, joined MLB Network's Greg Amsinger for the announcement.\n\n\"Baseball belongs in Tennessee,\" Lee said, referencing \"Say Hey Kid\" Willie Mays' time on the Chattanooga Choo-Choos.\n\nThe field will be built across the infield and part of the track, MLB announced. Fan seating will run across about two-thirds of the existing Bristol stands, fanning out around the outfield. A smaller set of stands will be built right behind homeplate and the infield.\n\nTickets go on sale in early December. Presale for race fans starts in September.\n\n\"For me, and our state, it gives a picture to Americans of how remarkable or how unique it is here,\" Lee said. \"When we have these global sports events, the world sees what we know in Tennessee.\"\n\nOrganizers are betting fans of the Reds, Braves and NASCAR will travel to the special game.\n\n\"We're bringing major league baseball and auto racing together,\" NASCAR announcer Jamie Little said. \"And who wins? The fans.\"\n\nBraves legend Chipper Jones said he's excited to see the spectacle of a baseball game in the massive speedway.\n\n\"Being from the South, knowing what NASCAR means to everyone from the South (means a lot),\" Jones said. All professional athletes stand in awe of professional athletes in other sports. I stand in amazement of what these guys do.\"\n\nReds legend Eric Davis said the league's emphasis on speeding up games pairs with Bristol's famous half-mile banked track.\n\nMLB announced the Reds will be the home team for the game. The game will be on a Saturday with Sunday held as a potential rain date.\n\nMusic will play a role in Braves-Reds game\n\nBristol is known as the birthplace of country music, and a concert will be a part of the festivities.\n\n\"Big sporting events and music go hand in hand - nobody does music like Tennessee,\" Lee said.\n\nIt's a Bristol tradition, after all. Fields surrounding the track are transformed into a village of tents and vendors on race weekends.\n\nThe game will be a moneymaker for Tennessee\n\nLee said the game is expected to bring in $100 million to the Volunteer State.\n\n\"The ripple effects of that are hard to measure,\" Lee said. \"When people see the uniqueness of the state, it's good for Tennessee.\"\n\nHow are state officials preparing for the game?\n\nTennessee and MLB officials are expecting a full stadium. Making sure there's adequate infrastructure of an influx of people will be key, Lee said.\n\n\"We hold major sporting events and enormous crowds,\" Lee said. \"We know how to prepare for it, we know what public safety should look like. (People) want to know its going to be safe when they come here, they want to know it's going to be easy to get here and easy to get out.\"\n\nThe state will work with local officials who are used to hosting massive crowds in the vast, open fields surrounding the track on race weekends.\n\nBristol has a history of hosting events\n\nBristol's short track is home to annual NASCAR races, of course, and other races throughout the year.\n\nIn 2016, the Tennessee Vols played Virginia Tech in front of an audience of 156,990. It was the largest crowd ever at an NCAA football game.\n\nHow do they do it? Meticulous planning. They'll bring in 160,000 tons of gravel, two sets of drain systems and demolish and rebuild some of the track's walls to build netting to protect fans.\n\nBristol is under about 2 hours away from Knoxville and 4 1/2 hours from Nashville.", "source": {"uri": "onlineathens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Athens Banner Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Meanwhile, Jordan Bianchi and Evan Drellich of the Athletic officially broke the story earlier in the week.\n\nIt's a go as the white flag has officially dropped - to borrow a racing metaphor - for the countdown.\n\nPeople are also reading...

If rained out, the game would be played the following day according to Jeremiah Yolkut, MLB's vice president in charge of global events.\n\nThe VIPs at BMS on Friday included Baseball Hall of Famer and Braves legend Chipper Jones, along with Eric Davis who starred for the Cincinnati Reds when they won the 1990 World Series. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred did not make an appearance despite being scheduled to do so.\n\nHead baseball coaches from area high schools were invited with Sullivan East's Mike Breuninger, John Battle's Jimmy Gobble, Virginia High's Adam Moore and Providence Academy's Jeff Reed among those spotted in the large crowd. Gobble and Reed both played in the majors with Reed winning a World Series ring as a catcher with the Reds in 1990.\n\nMeanwhile, Chipper Jones was visiting Bristol Motor Speedway for the first time.\n\n\"Very exciting,\" Jones said. \"I know everybody in the Braves organization is crazy jacked to get here. On a personal note, this is a place I've held high on my bucket list for a very long time.\"\n\nThe game is being held in what players call the \"dog days\" of the season, but an event that will have all the feel of a postseason game could provide a major pick-me-up.\n\n\"The routine for a major league baseball player gets kind of monotonous,\" Jones said. \"You do it all day, every day. Very seldom do you have a day off. It's good to have something to kind of break the monotony and this is the perfect instance for that. ... Right around the end of July, start of August most guys will tell you they hit a wall for about a week or 10 days where they aren't quite themselves. I feel like a break from the everyday monotony to come up here and be a part of something as special as this - every guy on that roster is going to sign up for it I promise you.\"\n\nMLB, NFL and NBA exhibition games have been held in Bristol before.\n\nThere were those aforementioned 1922 MLB exhibitions at Tenneva Field, located on what is now Commonwealth Avenue where Strongwell Corporation sits.\n\nBristol's racetrack was the home of a 1961 NFL preseason game between the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nA 1983 NBA preseason game between the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers was contested at Viking Hall.\n\nThis will be a regular season game at Bristol Motor Speedway and could provide the venue a single-game attendance record in yet another sport.\n\nTennessee's 45-24 victory over Virginia Tech on Sept. 10, 2016, in the \"Battle at Bristol\" established a college football crowd record that still stands.\n\nThe MLB mark for single-game attendance is the 115,300 who showed up at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for an exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers on March 29, 2008.\n\nA regular-season doubleheader between the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees at Municipal Stadium in Ohio apparently brought in 86,563 fans on Sept. 12, 1954. Game 5 of the 1959 World Series in Los Angeles had 92,706 people come through the turnstiles.\n\nTennessee Governor Bill Lee said there was a \"probability\" and \"likelihood\" that Bristol would own the MLB mark by this time next year.\n\nIt also could provide more momentum for the growing cause to put an MLB expansion team in Nashville.\n\nHaving the area's two most popular teams and two closest big-league teams - Atlanta and Cincinnati -playing each other will certainly put butts in the seats.\n\nHere's one connection between the two franchises that showcase the area's rich baseball heritage.\n\nClyde \"Hardrock\" Shoun of Mountain City, Tennessee, pitched for five seasons for Cincinnati and three seasons with the Boston Braves in the 1940s.\n\nHe pitched a no-hitter for the Reds on May 15, 1944, against the Braves.\n\nThe Speedway Classic could also occur a week after another major baseball milestone for the area.\n\nFormer Tazewell High School star Billy Wagner is expected to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2025 - the fireballing relief pitcher missed enshrinement by five votes when the most recent ballots were unveiled in January - and induction day is set for July 27, 2025, in Cooperstown, New York.\n\nPerhaps the Southwest Virginia native could throw out the first pitch at BMS as he closed out his stellar 16-year big-league career with the Braves in 2010.\n\n\"I think it would be awesome to throw out the first pitch but I'm sure there are much better options,\" Wagner said on Thursday in a telephone interview.\n\nWagner had been to BMS before.\n\n\"Of course,\" Wagner said. \"Was a big fan of [NASCAR driver] Morgan Shepherd.\"\n\nCount him among those all in when it comes to baseball at BMS.\n\n\"Playing in front of that type of crowd will be electric,\" Wagner said.\n\nSouthwest Virginia native and ex-East Tennessee State University slugger Ed Goodson played 47 games for the Atlanta Braves in 1975 - sandwiched between stints with the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers during an eight-season career - and could make the trip from his home in Grayson County, Virginia.\n\n\"I have never been to any events there,\" Goodson said. \"I got to see it quite a few times on my trips to and from Ivanhoe [Virginia] to ETSU when I was in college. ... I would be interested in attending the game if I can get [son] Kirk [Goodson], my son-in-law, and my three grandsons to go.\"\n\nVirginia High graduate Justin Grimm won a World Series in 2010 while pitching for the Chicago Cubs and now lives in Nashville. He's saved the date.\n\n\"I love that MLB is bringing the game to the East Tennessee area,\" Grimm said. \"When I read about it, I had to do a double take and immediately text my brother [Matt] and told him to put it on the calendar. What a great way for our area to go watch a big-league ballgame.\"\n\nThe dimensions presented of the playing field on Friday included 330 feet down the lines as the diamond would be situated in one corner of the racing infield. Plenty of work is still yet to be done.\n\n\"It's going to be really fun to watch the transformation take place,\" Jones said.\n\nMLB has held regular season games at historic Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, the Field of Dreams in Dyersville, Iowa, and foreign countries in recent years.\n\nBristol Motor Speedway and Major League Baseball are attempting to turn quite a double play.\n\n\"You walk into the venue and right away you know you're in a different kind of place, something incredibly special,\" Yolkut said. \"Not only is it big on the outside, but the energy on the inside, even when it is empty, is different than any of the other places we've recently been.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree

Meanwhile, Jordan Bianchi and Evan Drellich of the Athletic officially broke the story earlier in the week.\n\nIt's a go as the white flag has officially dropped - to borrow a racing metaphor - for the countdown.\n\nPeople are also reading...

If rained out, the game would be played the following day according to Jeremiah Yolkut, MLB's vice president in charge of global events.\n\nThe VIPs at BMS on Friday included Baseball Hall of Famer and Braves legend Chipper Jones, along with Eric Davis who starred for the Cincinnati Reds when they won the 1990 World Series. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred did not make an appearance despite being scheduled to do so.\n\nHead baseball coaches from area high schools were invited with Sullivan East's Mike Breuninger, John Battle's Jimmy Gobble, Virginia High's Adam Moore and Providence Academy's Jeff Reed among those spotted in the large crowd. Gobble and Reed both played in the majors with Reed winning a World Series ring as a catcher with the Reds in 1990.\n\nMeanwhile, Chipper Jones was visiting Bristol Motor Speedway for the first time.\n\n\"Very exciting,\" Jones said. \"I know everybody in the Braves organization is crazy jacked to get here. On a personal note, this is a place I've held high on my bucket list for a very long time.\"\n\nThe game is being held in what players call the \"dog days\" of the season, but an event that will have all the feel of a postseason game could provide a major pick-me-up.\n\n\"The routine for a major league baseball player gets kind of monotonous,\" Jones said. \"You do it all day, every day. Very seldom do you have a day off. It's good to have something to kind of break the monotony and this is the perfect instance for that. ... Right around the end of July, start of August most guys will tell you they hit a wall for about a week or 10 days where they aren't quite themselves. I feel like a break from the everyday monotony to come up here and be a part of something as special as this - every guy on that roster is going to sign up for it I promise you.\"\n\nMLB, NFL and NBA exhibition games have been held in Bristol before.\n\nThere were those aforementioned 1922 MLB exhibitions at Tenneva Field, located on what is now Commonwealth Avenue where Strongwell Corporation sits.\n\nBristol's racetrack was the home of a 1961 NFL preseason game between the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nA 1983 NBA preseason game between the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers was contested at Viking Hall.\n\nThis will be a regular season game at Bristol Motor Speedway and could provide the venue a single-game attendance record in yet another sport.\n\nTennessee's 45-24 victory over Virginia Tech on Sept. 10, 2016, in the \"Battle at Bristol\" established a college football crowd record that still stands.\n\nThe MLB mark for single-game attendance is the 115,300 who showed up at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for an exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers on March 29, 2008.\n\nA regular-season doubleheader between the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees at Municipal Stadium in Ohio apparently brought in 86,563 fans on Sept. 12, 1954. Game 5 of the 1959 World Series in Los Angeles had 92,706 people come through the turnstiles.\n\nTennessee Governor Bill Lee said there was a \"probability\" and \"likelihood\" that Bristol would own the MLB mark by this time next year.\n\nIt also could provide more momentum for the growing cause to put an MLB expansion team in Nashville.\n\nHaving the area's two most popular teams and two closest big-league teams - Atlanta and Cincinnati -playing each other will certainly put butts in the seats.\n\nHere's one connection between the two franchises that showcase the area's rich baseball heritage.\n\nClyde \"Hardrock\" Shoun of Mountain City, Tennessee, pitched for five seasons for Cincinnati and three seasons with the Boston Braves in the 1940s.\n\nHe pitched a no-hitter for the Reds on May 15, 1944, against the Braves.\n\nThe Speedway Classic could also occur a week after another major baseball milestone for the area.\n\nFormer Tazewell High School star Billy Wagner is expected to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2025 - the fireballing relief pitcher missed enshrinement by five votes when the most recent ballots were unveiled in January - and induction day is set for July 27, 2025, in Cooperstown, New York.\n\nPerhaps the Southwest Virginia native could throw out the first pitch at BMS as he closed out his stellar 16-year big-league career with the Braves in 2010.\n\n\"I think it would be awesome to throw out the first pitch but I'm sure there are much better options,\" Wagner said on Thursday in a telephone interview.\n\nWagner had been to BMS before.\n\n\"Of course,\" Wagner said. \"Was a big fan of [NASCAR driver] Morgan Shepherd.\"\n\nCount him among those all in when it comes to baseball at BMS.\n\n\"Playing in front of that type of crowd will be electric,\" Wagner said.\n\nSouthwest Virginia native and ex-East Tennessee State University slugger Ed Goodson played 47 games for the Atlanta Braves in 1975 - sandwiched between stints with the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers during an eight-season career - and could make the trip from his home in Grayson County, Virginia.\n\n\"I have never been to any events there,\" Goodson said. \"I got to see it quite a few times on my trips to and from Ivanhoe [Virginia] to ETSU when I was in college. ... I would be interested in attending the game if I can get [son] Kirk [Goodson], my son-in-law, and my three grandsons to go.\"\n\nVirginia High graduate Justin Grimm won a World Series in 2010 while pitching for the Chicago Cubs and now lives in Nashville. He's saved the date.\n\n\"I love that MLB is bringing the game to the East Tennessee area,\" Grimm said. \"When I read about it, I had to do a double take and immediately text my brother [Matt] and told him to put it on the calendar. What a great way for our area to go watch a big-league ballgame.\"\n\nThe dimensions presented of the playing field on Friday included 330 feet down the lines as the diamond would be situated in one corner of the racing infield. Plenty of work is still yet to be done.\n\n\"It's going to be really fun to watch the transformation take place,\" Jones said.\n\nMLB has held regular season games at historic Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, the Field of Dreams in Dyersville, Iowa, and foreign countries in recent years.\n\nBristol Motor Speedway and Major League Baseball are attempting to turn quite a double play.\n\n\"You walk into the venue and right away you know you're in a different kind of place, something incredibly special,\" Yolkut said. \"Not only is it big on the outside, but the energy on the inside, even when it is empty, is different than any of the other places we've recently been.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree

Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Atlanta Braves will reportedly play the Cincinnati Reds in a regular season game at the Bristol Motor Speedway in 2025. Multiple sources have told the Athletic that the official announcement will come on Friday.\n\nThe announcement will be held at the track and will include MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred and Speedway Motorsports CEO Marcus Smith. Smith is also the son of Bruton Smith, the founder of Speedway Motorsports and Sonic Automotive.\n\nWith a capacity of over 150,000, this has to potential to be one of the highest-attended baseball games ever. The current record is 115,000 fans when the Los Angeles Dodgers hosted the Boston Red Sox for an exhibition game in 2008 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum - the original LA home of the Dodgers from 1958 to 1961.\n\nIf any game has a chance to break that record, it's this one. What also differentiates this upcoming game is that it is a regular season game vs the current record coming from an exhibition game.\n\nHowever, just like with LA Coliseum, it'll be interesting to see what the dimensions of this game will look like. Baseball games at LA Coliseum were known for being played with almost no left field to be found. Click here to see what it looked like.\n\nBaseball is not the first non-motorsport to be held at this site. The Tennessee Volunteers hosted Virginia Tech for a college football neutral site game dubbed the \"Battle at Bristol\" back in 2016.\n\nSo this venue has experience staging neutral site games in non-traditional venues, but football fits into this stadium's shape perfectly. A square gridiron field and a baseball are not the same.\n\nSome seats that usually have good sightlines might not be as good as they usually are. Maybe instead of angling it like did in Los Angeles, they split the difference and chop off both outfield corners like it's the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. Have an absurdly deep center field and every fly ball down the line is a home run and making Yankee hitters jealous the whole time with how short of a porch there is.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruton_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruton Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedway_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speedway Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Acu\u00f1a_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Automotive", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonic Automotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Volunteers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_Grounds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polo Grounds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Drinking_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Drinking Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4315,h_2427,x_110,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/braves_today/01j4mxbamfn5rxsvwxsm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795995", "eventUri": "eng-9795995", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Organizers are hoping that Speedway Classic will set an all-time attendance record for Major League Baseball.\n\nThe current MLB attendance record of 115,300 was set in 2008 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for an exhibition contest between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nMarcus Smith is the President and CEO of Speedway Motorsports, which owns BMS and other NASCAR tracks.\n\n\"We love these special events, and I think this event is going to be a lot of fun for both NASCAR fans and Major League Baseball fans,\" Smith said.\n\nSince the ambitious concept was first proposed, followers of both sports have debated just how a temporary baseball diamond can be constructed around a 0.533-concrete oval track.\n\nSteve Swift is the senior vice-president of operations and development for Speedway Motorsports. He's been the mastermind for many bold projects at BMS and other Speedway Motorsports tracks, including the revival of once-dormant North Wilkesboro Speedway.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" Swift said. \"We've been blessed to work with Marcus, and his father Bruton always had big dreams. We've been known for firsts and baseball is another first.\"\n\nThe 2016 Battle at Bristol football game between the University of Tennessee and Virginia Tech attracted an NCAA record crowd of 156,990.\n\n\"The football game was a huge undertaking and the baseball game just adds to that legacy,\" Swift said. \"Having challenges like this is what keeps us going. Working to make events happen is special to me.\"\n\nSeveral alterations will be made to the BMS infield, but Swift said the screen for the massive Colossus TV will stay in place.\n\n\"We've talked to the engineers and some of the cables for the screen are just safety precautions, so we could take those down,\" Swift said.\n\nSwift said home plate will be located at the current start-finish line for NASCAR races on the pit side. A fan zone area will be designated at one end of the infield.\n\nA portion of the road wall will be removed along with the Goodyear tire building.\n\nAccording to Swift, the baseball makeover will begin after the 2025 Spring race. The 2025 NASCAR schedule has not been released, but no changes are expected in the BMS race dates.\n\n\"The great part is that we will have plenty of time on the front end of the work,\" Swift said. \"The crunch time to turn the track around will be heading into our September race.\"\n\nSeveral renderings of the makeshift field were on display Friday along with an outline of the proposed field.\n\nThe dimensions will be 400 feet to center, 375 to right field and 384 to left.\n\nSwift said talks for the MLB-NASCAR marriage have been underway for 3-4 years.\n\n\"There has been a lot of conversation around this, and now things can finally start happening,\" Swift said.\n\nNASCAR Cup Series regulars Chase Elliott and Ross Chastain and former Cup regular Kevin Harvick took part in a ceremonial first-pitch along with former MLB greats Eric Davis of the Reds and Hall of Famer Chipper Jones of the Braves.\n\n\"It was really cool to take Chipper around the track for a couple of laps,\" Elliott said. \"I'm a Braves fan and I grew up watching the team. It's an honor for me to help promote this event.\"\n\nElliott said he hopes to attend the game.\n\n\"I'm not sure what my schedule looks like next year but I guarantee that whoever attends will have a really great experience,\" Elliott said. \"Bristol is one of the best facilities we come to each year, and everybody in this industry will tell you the same thing.\"\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the first MLB contest in Tennessee history will have a major economic impact across the region and state.\n\n\"History will be made here,\" Lee said.\n\nTicket sales for the general public begin in December, but season-ticket holders from both teams and BMS will have first access in September. No ticket price was announced.\n\nA date of Aug. 3 has been set aside for a rain makeup.\n\nagregory@bristolnews.com | Twitter: @Greg_BHCSports | (276) 645-2544\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local

I think our fan bases fit naturally together, but I think we can do a lot of fun things to expose folks to both sides of that.\"\n\nRELATED: Start your engines and buy tickets here!\n\nRepresenting the NASCAR contingent at the 0.533-mile bullring race track were drivers Chase Elliott, Ross Chastain and analyst Kevin Harvick along with Speedway Motorsports president and CEO Marcus Smith, while Atlanta Braves legend Chipper Jones and Reds legend Eric Davis joined to represent their respective former teams. Elliott, the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion, is a longtime Braves fan hailing from Dawsonville, Georgia, with Jones a NASCAR fan dating back decades.\n\nFriday, though, marked Jones' first time inside the \"Last Great Colosseum\" before taking hot laps as a passenger in a stock car with Elliott. The mammoth stadium -- albeit a short track by NASCAR's standards -- took Jones aback despite having attended multiple Daytona 500s as a Florida native just 20 miles inland from the \"World Center of Racing.\"\n\n\"I think if you had a camera on me, my mouth would have been wide open,\" Jones said of his initial reaction to Bristol, imagining the tens of racing haulers packed into the center of the track. \"I think seeing these stands full -- being from the South and knowing what NASCAR means to everybody in the South, seeing all these butts in the seats and how loud it gets and just the bumping for four hours.\n\n\"Like I said, my pucker factor was a 9.5, and it was just me and him (Elliott) out there, you know? I mean, can you imagine 38, 39 other cars in such close proximity? All professional athletes stand in awe of professional athletes in other sports, and like no other, I stand in amazement at what these guys do.\"\n\nYolkut has led numerous global projects in his time with the MLB, including events at the historic Rickwood Field in Alabama and the MLB London Series at London Stadium in England. With a keen eye for big events, Yolkut sought a big venue that brought its own history. Enter Bristol.\n\n\"It all starts with an idea,\" Yolkut said. \"And for many years, a lot of folks within our organization and some of our partner organizations brought up the concept of playing at a large-scale sporting venue. And there's not a lot of places that can host Major League Baseball. Our diamond obviously is unique -- much different than some of the other sports. And so you really have to be strategic about what places you look at.\n\n\"But Bristol kept coming up as a possibility. And a few years ago, we came down here to take a look at it. And as Jerry mentioned in his commentary, you walk into the venue and right away, you know you're in a different kind of place, something incredibly special. Not only is it big on the outside, but the energy that's on the inside, even when it's empty, is different than any of the places that we've recently been, and that's something you're looking to make true.\"\n\nYolkut said MLB will work with BaAM Productions, BrightView and Populous as it has in past builds to create the layout of the playing field and \"allow us to bring these sites to life and figure out ways in which you can put a baseball diamond on an infield track with a giant scoreboard in the middle, and then bring in tens of thousands of fans to watch that and create that environment.\"\n\n\"So, with those folks, as well as the folks here at Bristol, we have no doubt that we will be able to work through all the various things that will come up over the next year,\" Yolkut said. \"But for the most part, a good amount of the planning is done, and now it's a matter of executing on that plan and building a diamond here in August of 2025.\"\n\nMurray Cook, leading BrightView's field design and construction, acknowledged the challenges of fitting an MLB diamond with the confines of the Bristol footprint, noting a portion of the Goodyear building inside Turns 1 and 2 will need to be removed in addition to several pit walls. He added the build is expected to take 30 days with an anticipated start on July 1, 2025.\n\n\"We've got a good design laid out as far as the actual dimensions of the park,\" Cook said. \"Got 330 (feet) down the lines and 400 to center. We got 375 to the right field alley, which is going to require part of the building out there to be removed, and we're 384 (feet) to the left field alley. So we've got good dimensions all the way around, very respectable to any major-league park in the US.\n\n\"I think that, from a construction standpoint and planning, you know, again, there's a lot of leveling needs to be done as you mentioned, and our goal there is to level that up with gravel like they typically would under the baseball fields and soccer fields that they use synthetic turf on. And obviously that's also creating a large drainage issue with the actual infield pit area, so we're putting a lot of drainage. So we're in the engineering process to get that buttoned up. But again, we're on a good path and got some good local partners here to work with.\"\n\nElliott, NASCAR's six-time defending Most Popular Driver, has long rooted for the Braves and was rewarded for it as a fan in 2021 as the Braves stormed to its first World Series title since 1995. In fact, Elliott even pulled his own version of double-duty as a driver-fan on Halloween that year, leading 289 laps at Martinsville Speedway, qualifying for the Championship 4 and then flying home to Dawsonville while the Braves played the Houston Astros in Game 5 with a 3-1 series advantage.\n\n\"I had some tickets, and I wasn't sure whether or not I was gonna go,\" Elliott recalled, \"and I had decided coming home I was pretty tired and I wasn't gonna go. And I was driving to my house, and I was listening on radio, and (Adam Duvall) hit a four-run home run there early in the game. ... And they would have won the series that night if they had won. And I was like, oh my gosh, they just hit this home run. I'm gonna have to go. So I took a right, went south, and I showed up down there, and they ended up blowing the game. But they got it back a couple nights later. It was pretty fun, though.\"\n\nThe ties between baseball and racing run deep, and that has perhaps never been more true than Friday's announcement. And while it's a baseball game on deck at Bristol, Chastain sees beauty on both sides of the proverbial coin.\n\nMORE: How to get notified for 2025 schedule release\n\n\"I think it's unmeasurable what it could do for both sports,\" Chastain said. \"People coming here may have never even heard of Bristol, but they're coming for the baseball game. And Bristol season-ticket holders might think, 'You know what? I went to the football game. I went to the dirt sprint car races and the dirt races here and a bunch of NASCAR races. I want to go see a baseball game here.' I think you're gonna have quite a bit of cross-pollination with that.\"\n\nIndeed, the \"World's Fastest Half-Mile\" housed the 2016 \"Battle at Bristol,\" a regular-season college football contest between the University of Tennessee and Virginia Tech, a game that drew an NCAA football record crowd of 156,990 people to the \"Last Great Colosseum.\"\n\nThe track additionally hosted an NCAA FCS football game between East Tennessee State and Western Carolina one week after the \"Battle of Bristol,\" while the National Football League played an exhibition football game at Bristol between Philadelphia and Washington in 1961.\n\nWhat's set to come in 2025, however, is something entirely new. The facility has never played host to professional baseball, and the state of Tennessee has never hosted an MLB game. Now, two franchises steeped in history are set to write a new chapter within the concrete oval next year.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"},

The game will be between the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds; both cities a just shy of a 5-hour drive from the speedway.\n\nBristol sits on the Tennessee-Virginia border, about 115 miles north of Gatlinburg. The official announcement of the matchup from MLB is reportedly expected to come Friday.\n\nWith this game, a new baseball attendance record could be set.\n\nBristol Motor Speedway has a capacity of 153,000 for car racing, and depending on how the field is built and the seating is situated, it could be the place where the largest crowd to watch an MLB game has ever gathered.\n\nCurrently, depending on how you want to look at it, there are actually two records. And no, this doesn't involve an asterisk like Roger Maris' home run record.\n\nThe most recent record was set at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 2008 when the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox drew 115,300 spectators for a pre-season exhibition game.\n\nThe season marked 50 years since the Dodgers moved to LA from Brooklyn in 1958, and since the team was housed in the LA Coliseum until Dodger Stadium opened in 1962, the Dodgers made a nostalgic return to the facility.\n\nBut some may say that's not the official record. After all, the game was an exhibition - not exactly what some would call an \"official\" game since it didn't take place during the regular season.\n\nThat particular record belongs to the Colorado Rockies.\n\nWhen baseball expanded by two teams in 1993 (the Florida Marlins were the other franchise), the Rockies stadium, Coors Field, wasn't complete and wouldn't be for the next two years. Thus, the team shared old Mile High Stadium, which was multipurpose and housed previous minor league baseball teams, but it is forever known as the home of the NFL's Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Rockies played the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals) on April 9, 1993 to a crowd of 84,087.\n\nAnd this isn't the first time Major League Baseball has ventured out of the cities of its 30 teams to play games.\n\nMLB has hosted games in London, Japan, Australia and Mexico. The league has also hosted games at the legendary Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama; at the site of the \"Field of Dreams\" filming location in Iowa and Fort Bragg in North Carolina - the first time an MLB game took place on an active military base.\n\nThere was even a game played in Hawaii in 1997 at Aloha Stadium.\n\nThe San Diego Padres ballpark at the time, Qualcomm Stadium (Jack Murphy Stadium to purists) was undergoing renovations and was not ready for the start of the baseball season. So the Padres' series against the St. Louis Cardinals was moved to Aloha Stadium - better known as the longtime home of the NFL Pro Bowl - but like so may others was a multipurpose facility for both sports.\n\nOther sports have had their moments in different places too.\n\nNCAA basketball was played on the deck of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and the NH hosts the Stadium Series and Winter Classic each year at baseball and football stadiums for outdoor games.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri":

However, every once in a while, a unique opportunity presents itself to the venue, and the stadium trades out its race cars for another sporting event.\n\nThis time around, the Bristol, Tennessee racetrack will transform into a baseball diamond. The Athletic first reported that the 150,000 seat stadium will be the host of a neutral site game between the Cincinnati Reds and the Atlanta Braves in 2025.\n\nThe two national league teams will have similar travel times to the racetrack that's almost smack dab in the middle of their homes. For Atlanta, they'll have to travel around four hours from their usual place of play, and for Cincinnati, they'll face a five hour drive to get to Bristol.\n\nWith the two teams matching up at a neutral site, it should give fans a chance to \"meet in the middle\" and go see their favorite team there instead of driving all the way to one place or the other. At the very least, baseball fans will be treated to a classic game of baseball in a stadium that's much different than what a regular ball park looks like.\n\nAnd it's not the first time that the speedway was converted to fulfill another purpose. Back in 2016, Virginia Tech and Tennessee played a game there, and set the record for highest attended NCAA football game with 156,990 fans in attendance.\n\nThe regular season game is set to be played at Bristol Motor Speedway on August 2nd of 2025. An official announcement is expected to be released this Friday at a planned news conference at the racetrack.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, it will be the first ever in-season Major League Baseball game played in the state of Tennessee.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_track_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval track racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Bristol-2048x1121.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795995", "eventUri": "eng-9795995", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 1448, "textEnd": 1458}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Not really a NASCAR fan, he said.\n\nOn the other hand, he is a fan of MLB's plan to send the Reds and Atlanta Braves to Bristol to play a regular-season game on a diamond prepared on the infield of the stock car track next season.\n\n\"That sounds interesting,\" Moll said. Maybe even fun,\n\nExcept for one thing that crossed his mind.\n\n\"As a pitcher I'm hoping the lines aren't 270 (feet),\" he said, \"Like, 'OK, thanks, guys. This is going to be great.' \"\n\nIt does seem to have the potential for an old Polo Grounds feel. The New York Giants' old ballpark in Harlem was shaped like an oval, with foul lines that were 277 feet down left field and 258 down right.\n\n\"And center was, like, 500, right?\" Moll said.\n\nThe Athletic was first Tuesday with the report of the latest in a series MLB games staged at unique venues, including the 2022 Field of Dreams game in Dyersville, Iowa, featuring the Reds and Chicago Cubs. A formal announcement is expected Friday.\n\nThis first-of-its kind baseball stage presents the opportunity for the Reds and Braves to set a record for single-game baseball attendance, given the potential for seating capacity of more than 150,000.\n\nMLB's all-time attendance mark is 115,300 for a 2008 game at the Los Angeles Coliseum between the Dodgers and Boston Red Sox, according to the Athletic report. Bristol hosted a college football game between nearby University of Tennessee and Virginia Tech that drew an American football record 156,990.\n\n\"I've never bene to Bristol. But I've been to Daytona,\" said Reds pitcher Carson Spiers, a South Carolina native, who has become a NASCAR fan just this year, thanks to a sort of fantasy league he and some former Louisville teammates put together.\n\n\"That's sweet,\" he said. \"It'll be fun.\"\n\nSpiers has one request: that favorite driver Ty Gibbs show up. \"Tell him to come,\" Spiers said.\n\nIf Gibbs does, maybe he can help settle what's sure to be a burning question. What's faster, Gibbs in Turn 3 or Elly De La Cruz on the way from first to second base.\n\n\"Quite the dilemma there,\" Moll said. \"I think it'd be pretty close.\"", "source": {"uri":

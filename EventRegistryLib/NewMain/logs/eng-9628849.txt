Sources revealed that leaders from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, and Mauritius are among those expected to attend the event scheduled for the weekend.\n\nFollowing the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) victory in the recent Lok Sabha elections, securing 293 seats, PM Modi is poised to resume his role with renewed vigor.

During a phone call, Wickremesinghe congratulated PM Modi on his electoral success and expressed his eagerness to attend the event.\n\n\"During the conversation, Prime Minister @narendramodi invited President Wickremesinghe to his swearing-in ceremony, which President @RW_UNP accepted,\" stated the media division of the Sri Lankan President's office.\n\nIn a similar gesture, PM Modi invited Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during a phone call, and diplomatic sources have confirmed her acceptance.\n\nNepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda,' Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, and Prime Minister of Mauritius Pravind Jugnauth are also on the list of invitees, reflecting India's focus on fostering strong bilateral relationships within the region.

In 2019, the ceremony saw the presence of leaders from BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) countries as Modi began his second term.\n\nThe swearing-in ceremony is tentatively scheduled for June 8. Despite the BJP not achieving an outright majority, the NDA's coalition secured a robust 293 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, surpassing the majority threshold of 272 seats.\n\nThis event marks a significant moment in India's political history, highlighting PM Modi's enduring popularity and the NDA's strategic coalition-building efforts.

The Indian military personnel were replaced by civilians earlier this month.\n\nThe media division of President Wickremesinghe's office on Wednesday said Modi invited him to the swearing-in ceremony during a phone conversation. It said Wickremesinghe accepted the invite.\n\n\"During the conversation, Prime Minister @narendramodi invited President Wickremesinghe to his swearing-in ceremony, which President @RW_UNP accepted,\" it said on X.\n\nModi also had a phone conversation with Hasina on Wednesday. In the phone conversation, Modi invited Hasina to attend his swearing-in ceremony and she accepted it, diplomatic sources said.\n\nModi held separate phone conversations with Prachanda as well as Jugnauth.\n\nOn Thursday, Bhutanese PM Tobgay called up Modi and congratulated him on the victory of the NDA.\n\n\"Prime Minister Tobgay appreciated Prime Minister Modi's visionary leadership in the last decade, and conveyed his warm wishes for his successful third term,\" an Indian readout said.\n\n\"The prime minister thanked prime minister Tobgay for the warm felicitations. The prime minister conveyed that India accords the highest priority to its exemplary partnership with Bhutan,\" it said.\n\nIt said India-Bhutan partnership is characterized by utmost trust, goodwill, and mutual understanding at all levels and is reinforced by robust people to people linkages and close economic and development partnership.\n\nThe leaders of regional grouping SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries attended Modi's first swearing ceremony when he took the reins as the prime minister after a massive electoral victory for BJP.\n\nLeaders of the BIMSTEC countries attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony, in 2019 when he became prime minister for the second consecutive term.\n\nThough the BJP could not get a majority on its own in the polls, the party-led alliance secured 293 seats out of 543.

I look forward to working together to advance our shared interests in pursuit of shared prosperity and stability for our two countries.\"\n\nIn a reply to his post, Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu after the latter wished him the results of the Lok Sabha elections, and said he looks forward to closer cooperation for further strengthening of bilateral ties between the two nations.\n\nHe said Male is New Delhi's valued partner and neighbour in the Indian Ocean Region.\n\n\"Thank you President @MMuizzu. Maldives is our valued partner and neighbour in the Indian Ocean Region. I too look forward to closer cooperation for further strengthening our bilateral ties,\" PM Modi posted on X.\n\nTies between New Delhi and Male went low after Maldivian officials made some derogatory remarks about the Indian Prime Minister earlier this year. But during the visit last month, Foreign Minister of Maldives Moosa Zameer while speaking with ANI distanced his government from the derogatory remarks made by some of its ministers against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that it was not the stand of the government and that \"proper action\" has been taken to ensure that it is not repeated.\n\nEarlier, other global leaders also offered their heartfelt congratulations to PM Modi and the BJP-led NDA government on their third consecutive victory in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nOther leaders including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal have confirmed they will be attending the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources confirmed on Thursday.\n\nBoth Hasina and her Nepal counterpart Dahal had previously extended their greetings to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the performance of the NDA at the 18th Lok Sabha elections.\n\nSri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe too accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to attend his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nDuring his conversation, PM Modi invited President Wickremesinghe to his oath ceremony, which the Sri Lankan president accepted.\n\n\"During the conversation, Prime Minister @narendramodi invited President Wickremesinghe to his swearing-in ceremony, which President @RW_UNP accepted,\" the President's Media Division of Sri Lanka said in a post on X.\n\nPrime Minister of Mauritius Pravind Jugnauth too has been invited by India, but there has been no official confirmation from the Mauritius side.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to take oath for third successive term in office on June 9, sources said.\n\nBJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a successive third term in office in the results of Lok Sabha elections declared on June 4.\n\nPM Modi is likely to take oath on June 9 after the BJP-led NDA narrowly surpassed the majority mark, winning 293 seats in the 18th Lok Sabha elections, while the opposition INDIA bloc secured 234 seats.\n\nLeaders of parties in the National Democratic Alliance held a meeting on Wednesday and elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi

What's the significance behind these invites?", "body": "Narendra Modi is all smiles after the Lok Sabha election results declared his alliance, the NDA, as the winner. Reports say that he will most likely be sworn in on 8 June for a third term for which he has extended invites to few world leaders. PTI\n\nAfter resigning on Wednesday, prep is underway for Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony, which is likely to take place on 8 June. Modi is all set to take charge as the prime minister for a historic third consecutive term with the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) winning 293 seats in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nPeople familiar with the developments surrounding Modi's swearing-in have said that invitations have been sent out to a number of world leaders of India's neighbouring countries, including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\n\nA PTI news report has added that formal invitations for the same will be sent on Thursday.\n\nBut who exactly has Modi invited for his big day? And what's the significance behind the invites?\n\nWho's been invited?\n\nMultiple news reports have stated that caretaker PM Modi has extended invitations for his third term swearing-in ceremony to leaders of neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Mauritius, keeping in mind his 'Neighbourhood First' policy.\n\nSri Lanka and Bangladesh have confirmed the same, with Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sheikh Hasina already confirming their attendance.\n\nThe media office of Sri Lankan president Ranil Wickremesinghe confirmed that Modi extended an invitation to him for the swearing-in ceremony and Wickremesinghe had accepted the invitation.\n\nIt is reported that Modi held a phone conversation with Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and in the phone conversation, he invited Hasina to attend his swearing-in ceremony and she accepted it.\n\nIt has also been said that Nepal's Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', Bhutan's Tshering Tobgay and Mauritius' Pravind Jugnauth are set to be invited for Modi's swearing-in ceremony.\n\nWhat is the 'Neighbourhood First' policy?\n\nModi's choice of leaders for his oath-taking ceremony, according to experts, is his commitment to the 'Neighbourhood First' policy.\n\nBut what is this policy? Conceptualised in 2008, 'Neighbourhood First' policy of India is a core component of India's foreign policy. Before coming to power the first time around, Modi had stated that he would make this a core of his foreign policy.\n\nThis 'Neighbourhood First' policy guides India's approach towards the management of its relations with countries in its immediate neighbourhood -- Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nIn simple words, it is aimed at improving physical, digital and people to people connectivity across the region, as well as augmenting trade and commerce.\n\nAn ORF report states that the 'Neighbourhood First' approach is Modi's attempt to promote regional stability and prosperity, recognising the importance of a secure and cooperative neighbourhood for India's overall development and security.\n\nMany geopolitical experts also note that the 'Neighbourhood First' approach is India's attempt of countering China's growing influence in the region.\n\nAnd through his years in office, PM Modi has reiterated his commitment to this approach. For instance, when Sri Lanka faced a massive economic turmoil in 2022, India outdid even the IMF by extending a lifeline to their economy in the form of a $4 billion financial and humanitarian assistance. This has led to Colombo pivoting away from China.\n\nAnother example of India's 'Neighbourhood First' policy is when India sent COVID-19 vaccines worth Rs 22.5928 million to Bangladesh, followed by Rs 9.499 million worth to Nepal.\n\nAnother example of his commitment to the approach was that his first foreign visit after COVID-19 was to Bangladesh. Moreover, the two neighbours have come together to ink the historic Land Boundary Agreement .\n\nWhat about past Modi swearing-in events?\n\nNarendra Modi's invites for his third oath-taking ceremony follows a past tradition. In 2014, when Modi was sworn-in for his first term, the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) leaders, including then Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif, had been invited and had attended the ceremony.\n\nAt the time, Modi had also invited senior BJP and Congress leaders as well as Bollywood actors and top industrialists for the event. Along with Modi, 45 MPs, including seven women, had also been sworn in as ministers.\n\nThen in 2019, Modi had invited leaders of the BIMSTEC countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand for his second swearing-in ceremony. Kyrgyz president and then chair of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Sooronbay Jeenbekov, and Mauritius PM Pravind Kumar Jugnauth were also present at the event. Along with Modi, 24 Union ministers and nine ministers of state had also been sworn in at the event at Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n\nIt is still left to be seen who will be sworn in with Modi on 8 June, but experts note that there will be a larger representation from the allies owing to the BJP's less than stellar performance at the polls.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Both leaders have accepted the invitation, marking another chapter in India's diplomatic engagement with its neighbors.\n\nOn June 5, during a phone call, President Wickremesinghe congratulated PM Modi on the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance's electoral victory. In response, Modi thanked Wickremesinghe, highlighting the significance of Sri Lanka in India's Neighbourhood First policy. \"Sri Lanka is an important partner in our Neighbourhood First policy. India is proud to be a dependable partner for Sri Lanka. I look forward to realizing our joint vision of enhancing connectivity in all its dimensions,\" Modi wrote.\n\nSimilarly, PM Modi extended an invitation to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina following a telephonic conversation.\n\nHistorical Invitations\n\nThis is not the first time PM Modi has extended such invitations. In 2014, for his first oath ceremony, all SAARC heads of state were invited. In 2019, leaders from BIMSTEC countries, as well as Mauritius and Kyrgyzstan, were included. These invitations highlight India's commitment to regional cooperation and solidarity.\n\nPresident Wickremesinghe's recent visit to India on July 21, 2023, at PM Modi's invitation, underscores the strong bilateral relations. During this visit, Wickremesinghe met with President Droupadi Murmu and other Indian dignitaries, discussing a range of bilateral issues.\n\nMore Invitations\n\nAttention is now focused on which other leaders will be invited to the ceremony. In 2014 and 2019, SAARC and BIMSTEC leaders were invited, reflecting India's regional outreach. As Sri Lanka is a member of both groups, its leaders have been regular invitees.\n\nOfficials have not ruled out invitations to leaders from other regional countries, including those from the Gulf and Central Asia. However, the ability of these leaders to attend will depend on their availability at short notice. Security preparations in Delhi suggest that high-level visitors are anticipated.\n\nIn the coming weeks, several South Asian leaders, including those from Bangladesh, Bhutan, and possibly Sri Lanka, are expected to visit India, further cementing regional ties.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "express_defence@financialexpress.com", "name": "Express Defence", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ranil Wickremesinghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Sri_Lanka", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Sri Lanka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal_Initiative_for_Multi-Sectoral_Technical_and_Economic_Cooperation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_Association_for_Regional_Cooperation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mauritius"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mauritius"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droupadi_Murmu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Droupadi Murmu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrgyzstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kyrgyzstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations_and_Announcements", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations and Announcements", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Calligraphy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Calligraphy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PM-Modi-NDA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628849", "eventUri": "eng-9628849", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 317, "textEnd": 323}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 449, "textEnd": 455}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the invitation to Sheikh Hasina during a telephone conversation, which she graciously accepted.\n\nOn June 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina congratulated Narendra Modi on his election victory, marking the third consecutive win for his party. During their phone conversation, Sheikh Hasina extended her congratulations on behalf of the people of Bangladesh, her government, her family, and herself for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), winning the 18th Lok Sabha election.\n\n\"This victory of NDA for the third consecutive term was made possible due to your strong leadership\" Sheikh Hasina said:\n\nOn behalf of the people of Bangladesh and on my own behalf, I wish to extend my heartiest congratulations to you on the resounding victory of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 18th Lok Sabah elections.\n\nAs the leader of the largest democracy in the world, you carry the hopes and aspirations of the people of India. Your convincing victory is a testament to the trust and confidence that the people of India have reposed in your leadership, commitment and unwavering dedication for the country.\n\nIt is my firm belief that our friendly and close ties will continue in all areas, as you start the journey with renewed mandates for a rare 3rd consecutive term. Let me assure you that Bangladesh, as a trusted friend of India, will continue to work together for the betterment of the people of the two countries as well as for a prosperous and peaceful region.\n\nI would also like to convey my best wishes to the people of India for the continued peace, progress and prosperity.\n\nI look forward to closely working with you in the coming days.\n\nPlease accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that, since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister of India in 2014, Bangladesh-India relations have been steadily deepening, and this latest development is expected to further strengthen the ties between the two nations.\n\nThe relationship between Bangladesh and India has reached unprecedented levels of cooperation and mutual respect under the visionary leadership of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Their dynamic leadership has fostered stronger bilateral ties, enhancing collaboration across various sectors including trade, connectivity, defense, and cultural exchange.\n\nThe historical ties between Bangladesh and India are deeply rooted, with India playing a pivotal role in Bangladesh's liberation war in 1971. However, it is under the leadership of Modi and Hasina that these ties have been significantly strengthened. Since Narendra Modi took office in 2014, and with Sheikh Hasina's leadership since 2009, both leaders have shown a remarkable political will to elevate bilateral relations to new heights. Their personal rapport and frequent high-level meetings have paved the way for resolving long-standing issues and initiating new avenues of cooperation.\n\nEconomic engagement has been a cornerstone of the deepening relations between the two countries. India is one of Bangladesh's largest trading partners. In recent years, bilateral trade has surged, with both countries benefiting from mutual economic growth. The introduction of various trade agreements and the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers have facilitated smoother trade flows. India's investment in Bangladesh has also seen a significant increase, with Indian companies investing in sectors like telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and energy.\n\nConnectivity projects have been a major focus of Modi and Hasina's leadership. The revival of old railway lines, the establishment of new bus and train services, and the development of infrastructure at border points have greatly enhanced people-to-people contact and economic activity. The Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) Initiative is a prime example of their commitment to regional connectivity, aiming to facilitate the movement of goods and people among the four countries.\n\nWater sharing is a critical issue for both nations, with many rivers flowing between India and Bangladesh. The two leaders have made significant strides in addressing water-sharing concerns, notably with the signing of the historic Ganges Water Treaty in 1996, which laid the foundation for further cooperation. Ongoing discussions about the Teesta River and other transboundary rivers reflect their commitment to finding mutually beneficial solutions.\n\nIn the area of security and defense, India and Bangladesh have taken substantial steps to collaborate more closely. Joint military exercises, increased defense training exchanges, and enhanced cooperation in combating terrorism and transnational crimes underscore their strong defense ties. The recent agreement on the exchange of white shipping information is a testament to their growing maritime cooperation.\n\nCultural ties have always been strong between Bangladesh and India, with both countries sharing a rich cultural heritage. Initiatives like the opening of new cultural centers, increased scholarships for Bangladeshi students in India, and joint cultural festivals have further strengthened these bonds. These initiatives not only promote mutual understanding but also bring the people of both nations closer.\n\nPeople-to-people contact has been significantly enhanced through visa facilitation agreements and easier travel protocols. The introduction of multiple-entry visas and the establishment of more visa application centers in Bangladesh have made travel between the two countries more accessible. This has boosted tourism, medical travel, and educational exchanges.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made, challenges remain. Border management issues, particularly related to smuggling and illegal migration, need continuous attention. Environmental concerns, such as the impact of large infrastructure projects on local ecosystems, also require cooperative solutions. However, the strong foundation laid by Modi and Hasina's leadership provides a robust framework to address these challenges.\n\nWith Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarking on his historic third consecutive term, the relations between Bangladesh and India are poised to reach new heights. This milestone not only marks a significant moment in Indian politics but also signals a promising future for the deepening ties between the two neighboring nations. Under Modi's leadership and the steadfast partnership with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the bilateral relationship is expected to see further strengthening and expansion across various sectors.\n\nNarendra Modi's leadership since 2014 has been characterized by a proactive and strategic approach to foreign policy, particularly with neighboring countries. His relationship with Sheikh Hasina has been marked by mutual respect and a shared vision for regional stability and prosperity. This camaraderie has played a crucial role in overcoming historical challenges and fostering a spirit of collaboration and trust.\n\nThe relationship between Bangladesh and India has been characterized by mutual respect, strategic cooperation, and a shared vision for regional stability and prosperity. Maintaining a cordial relationship with India has brought immense benefits to Bangladesh across various sectors, from economic growth to infrastructure development, security, and cultural exchange. The dynamic partnership under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has significantly enhanced these benefits, creating a robust framework for future cooperation.\n\nUnder the magnanimous leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh-India relations have flourished, setting a new paradigm of bilateral cooperation. Their strategic vision, mutual respect, and commitment to regional stability and prosperity have not only benefited their respective nations but also set an example of how neighboring countries can work together for mutual benefit. As both nations continue to build on this solid foundation, the future of Bangladesh-India relations looks promising, heralding an era of enhanced cooperation and shared progress.", "source": {"uri":

Besides, all the countries that have been invited have a key place in the 'Neighbourhood First' policy,\" one of the people cited above said.\n\nEven before the formal invitations were sent out, officials in Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka had confirmed the participation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and President Ranil Wickremesinghe.\n\nAn aide to Hasina even announced that the premier would travel to New Delhi on Friday because the Bangladeshi side was led to believe the swearing-in ceremony would be held on June 8. Since the formal invitation mentioned that the inauguration was scheduled for June 9, officials in Dhaka said the premier would travel to India on Saturday.\n\nMaldivian President Mohamed Muizzu was a surprise addition to the list of invitees, given the strained relations between Male and New Delhi since his election last year on the back of an \"India Out\" campaign. Muizzu has taken a range of steps to move the Maldives closer to China, such as forcing India to recall more than 85 military personnel who were stationed in the Indian Ocean archipelago to operate two helicopters and an aircraft that were mainly used for medical evacuations and humanitarian relief operations.\n\nThe people said the decision to invite Muizzu was meant to signal that India is keen on continuing cooperation with the Maldives in key areas.\n\nMaldives confirmed Muizzu's acceptance of the invitation late on Thursday, with officials in Male saying he would be accompanied by three members of his cabinet, including foreign minister Moosa Zameer. This will be his first visit to India since coming to power.\n\nThere were other reasons for inviting the leaders of neighbouring countries to the inauguration, such as logistical considerations, the people said. Most of these leaders have close relations with India and would be willing to attend at short notice, while their presence would signal New Delhi's intention to keep the focus on the neighbourhood, the people said.\n\nHasina, during her phone call with Modi on Wednesday, pointed to the \"very cordial and friendly relations between Bangladesh and India\". Bangladesh is currently India's closest partner in the neighbourhood and both sides have taken forward several initiatives for road, rail and energy connectivity.\n\nIn his phone conversation with Wickremesinghe on Wednesday, Modi described Sri Lanka as an important partner in the \"Neighbourhood First\" policy and said India is \"proud to be a dependable partner\" for the island nation.\n\nThe leaders of seven member states of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) were invited to Modi's inauguration in 2014, while leaders of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) were invited to his swearing-in in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"},

However, an official confirmation is still pending to verify the new date and time for the event.\n\nOn Wednesday, PM Modi tendered his resignation and submitted his letter to President Droupadi Murmu in preparation for his oath ceremony.The President accepted his resignation as the Prime Minister and council of ministers, while requesting him to continue serving in his role until the formation of the new government.\n\nEarlier reports indicated that Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo Chandrababu Naidu, who was expected to be sworn-in as the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister on Sunday, will now take his oath on June 12.\n\nThis change in date was attributed to Narendra Modi's oath ceremony, which was previously anticipated to take place on Saturday (June 8).\n\nMeanwhile, PM Modi has invited Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to attend his upcoming swearing-in ceremony. Both leaders have graciously accepted the invitation, signifying a new phase in India's diplomatic efforts with its neighboring countries.\n\nExtending invitations to regional leaders is not a new practice for PM Modi. During his first oath ceremony in 2014, he invited all SAARC heads of state. In 2019, leaders from BIMSTEC countries, along with Mauritius and Kyrgyzstan, were also included.\n\nSpeculation is rife about which other leaders will receive invitations to the ceremony.\n\nWhile officials have not dismissed the possibility of inviting leaders from other regional countries, including those from the Gulf and Central Asia, their attendance will largely depend on their availability at short notice.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Amidst the backdrop of recent Lok Sabha election results, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) emerges victorious, albeit falling short of an absolute majority. However, with the backing of NDA allies, Narendra Modi stands poised to reclaim his position at the helm of India's governance.\n\nThe whirlwind of political developments commenced with the Election Commission of India's announcement of the Lok Sabha Election Results 2024, revealing the BJP's triumph on 240 out of 543 seats. Despite the absence of a landslide victory as projected by exit polls, the NDA's collective strength solidifies its position as the dominant force in Indian politics. The subsequent resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Union Council of Ministers marks the initial step towards the formation of a new government.\n\nIn a ceremonial gesture of democratic protocol, Narendra Modi tendered his resignation to President Droupadi Murmu, who graciously accepted it, while requesting the caretaker government to continue until the formation of the new administration. The groundwork for the transition to a new regime began with NDA members, including stalwarts like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu, unanimously electing Narendra Modi as their leader.\n\nAs the nation awaits the dawn of a new era in Indian governance, all eyes are set on the impending swearing-in ceremony, tentatively scheduled for June 8. This historic event promises to be a grand affair, with Narendra Modi extending invitations to esteemed leaders from neighboring countries, reaffirming India's commitment to its 'Neighbourhood First' policy.\n\nThe guest list for the swearing-in ceremony reads like a diplomatic roll call, with dignitaries from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, and Mauritius receiving formal invitations. Notable confirmations include Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who graciously accepted Modi's invitation, underscoring the warmth and camaraderie shared between the leaders.\n\nThe diplomatic overtures extend beyond mere formalities, symbolizing the strong bilateral ties and regional cooperation that India seeks to foster under Modi's leadership. The presence of esteemed leaders from South Asian nations not only amplifies the significance of the occasion but also underscores India's pivotal role in regional affairs.\n\nThe significance of Narendra Modi's third consecutive term cannot be overstated, as it reflects the electorate's endorsement of his leadership and vision for India's future. Despite electoral arithmetic dictating a coalition government, the resounding mandate bestowed upon the NDA reaffirms Modi's stature as a dominant political figure.\n\nReflecting on past ceremonies, Narendra Modi's swearing-in spectacles have transcended mere political rituals, evolving into grand diplomatic affairs that resonate on the global stage. From the attendance of SAARC leaders in 2014 to the participation of BIMSTEC countries in 2019, each event symbolizes India's growing diplomatic clout and regional influence.\n\nThe forthcoming swearing-in ceremony promises to be a fitting tribute to India's democratic ethos and cultural diversity, as leaders from diverse nations converge to witness the coronation of Narendra Modi for a historic third term. Beyond the pomp and pageantry lies a deeper message of solidarity and cooperation, as India reaffirms its commitment to fostering harmonious relations with its neighbors.\n\nIn the midst of global challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, Narendra Modi's leadership stands as a beacon of stability and continuity, guiding India towards a brighter and more prosperous future. As the curtains rise on yet another chapter in India's democratic journey, the nation stands united in its resolve to surmount the challenges ahead under the stewardship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nIn conclusion, Narendra Modi's imminent third term as Prime Minister heralds a new dawn for India, characterized by continuity, stability, and regional cooperation. The swearing-in ceremony serves as a poignant reminder of India's democratic resilience and its enduring commitment to fostering strong bonds with its neighbors. As the world watches with bated breath, India embarks on a new chapter in its storied history, under the visionary leadership of Narendra Modi.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news",

You carry the hopes and aspirations of the people of India,\" said Prime Minister Hasina during a telephonic conversation with Prime Minister Modi.\n\nSources in Bangladesh have informed The Hindu that the two sides have agreed on June 21 or 22 as the date of the meeting but maintained that the visit could alternately also take place in the last week of the month as June 21 is too close to the Eid holidays in the Muslim-majority nation.\n\nThe visit by Ms. Hasina is expected to be rich in symbolism as the two sides wish to utilise the interaction between the two leaders in New Delhi as an occasion to assert the positive nature of the bilateral relation especially as Ms. Hasina is expected to travel to China in July.\n\nSources also said that the Government of Bangladesh, which will present the annual budget on Thursday, is dealing with high inflation and Ms. Hasina will use her India visit to ensure uninterrupted cross border flow of commodities. Driven by food prices, Bangladesh's May inflation rate has touched 9.89% sparking widespread concern about the health of the Bangladesh economy.\n\nAny disruption in some of the essential items like rice and onion, which are imported by Bangladesh from India, could worsen the inflation in the neighbouring country, the sources further said. Trade and concerns about export of commodities from India are some of the issues that are expected to be on top of the agenda in the bilateral meeting, it has been learnt.\n\nPM Hasina's visit will draw attention also because of the fact that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is often viewed in Dhaka as a hurdle to Bangladesh's aspiration to acquire greater share of the Teesta river waters, has done well in the general election with her party Trinamool Congress winning 29 seats. Ms. Banerjee has heightened her criticism of Mr. Modi after the election results and has joined the Opposition alliance further reducing chances of any possible reconciliation between Delhi and Kolkata on the sharing of the river water in the short run.\n\nIn the backdrop of the stalled bilateral dialogue over the Teesta, India's concerns had increased as China was eyeing Dhaka's Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project. Indian sources had hinted that the matter had come up during Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra's Dhaka visit in May. After Mr. Kwatra met with PM Hasina during the visit, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Hasan Mahmood had said: \"You know we have taken on a big project on the Teesta. India wants to finance that. We said the project will have to be in accordance with our needs, it must fulfil our needs.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eid al-Fitr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mamata Banerjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teesta_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teesta River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/gcsynv/article68256840.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_SHEIKH_HASINA_DELHI_2_1_7IC79QRB.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628849", "eventUri": "eng-9628849", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 845, "textEnd": 852, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

They pledged \"to continue working together to further deepen the historic and close ties under the renewed mandate towards achieving the visions of Viksit Bharat 2047 and Smart Bangladesh 2041\".\n\nWhen Modi had taken the oath to commence his first term as the prime minister in May 2014, New Delhi had played host to the leaders of the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) nations, including M Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan. Modi had held separate bilateral meetings with all the SAARC leaders, including one with Sharif, which had raised hope for a thaw in bilateral relations. But after back-to-back terror attacks in India by outfits based in Pakistan, Modi had declined to attend the 19 SAARC summit that Sharif had planned to host in Islamabad in November 2016, leading to the cancellation of the conclave. The SAARC has remained in an impasse since then.\n\nWith New Delhi focussing on breathing fresh life into the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) and projecting it as an alternative to the SAARC for regional cooperation sans spoilsport Pakistan, the leaders of the seven-nation bloc had been invited to attend the second ceremony when Modi had taken the oath for his second term in May 2019.\n\nThe leaders of Myanmar and Afghanistan had attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in 2014 and 2019. But, with Myanmar ruled by a military junta since February 2021 and Afghanistan under the Taliban since August 2021, New Delhi refrained from sending out invitations to Kabul and Nay Pyi Daw this

This, however, will not be a structured bilateral meeting.\n\nThe two leaders will agree on bilateral new engagement for further discussion in the coming month (July), \"It's expected that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina may visit India again for comprehensive dialogue,\" Lahiri added. Adding, \"Economic partnership agreement may take shape during discussion.\"\n\nAccording to him, \"Apart from connectivity, new areas of cooperation are being explored including solar energy, space, nano technology. India is keen to expand defence cooperation with Bangladesh. Bangladesh wants to resolve Teesta water sharing. Pending this, both countries are looking for alternative projects like dredging and infusing more water into the river.\"\n\nFinancial Express Online has reported previously that the Bangladesh leader is scheduled to visit China next month and during her visit to New Delhi over the weekend, \"India will convey their concern on security issues. Bangladesh has promised they will not allow any project to China which may annoy Delhi,\" Lahiri explained.\n\nLast month in a significant diplomatic move, Foreign Secretary, Vinay Kwatra, embarked on an official visit to Bangladesh from May 8-9, 2024. This marked the first official visit to Bangladesh following the formation of the new government in January 2024, underlining the importance accorded to bilateral relations.\n\nKey Meetings and Discussions\n\nDuring his visit, Kwatra held meetings with key dignitaries, including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Foreign Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud, and his counterpart, Masud Bin Momen. These meetings were crucial in reaffirming India's commitment to its 'Neighbourhood First' Policy, a cornerstone of its foreign relations strategy.\n\nComprehensive Review of Bilateral Relations\n\nAt the core of discussions were various facets of the bilateral relationship, spanning political and security cooperation, water management, trade and investment, power and energy collaboration, defence ties, connectivity initiatives, and sub-regional cooperation. The comprehensive review of these areas underscores the depth and breadth of the Indo-Bangladesh partnership.\n\nImportance of the Indo-Bangladesh Partnership\n\nBangladesh holds a special place as India's leading development partner and its largest trade partner in the region. Against this backdrop, Kwatra's visit aimed to not only consolidate existing ties but also inject fresh momentum into bilateral cooperation across diverse sectors.\n\nFostering Stability and Development\n\nAs the region witnesses rapid geopolitical shifts and evolving security threats, the significance of strong, mutually beneficial relationships cannot be overstated. India's proactive outreach to its neighbours underscores its commitment to fostering stability, peace, and development in the South Asian region.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "huma_siddiqui@financialexpress.com", "name": "Huma Siddiqui", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Financial_Express_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Financial Express (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Seri_Begawan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandar Seri Begawan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bandar Seri Begawan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brunei"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masud_Bin_Momen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masud Bin Momen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Cooperatives", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/seikha-hasina-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628849", "eventUri": "eng-9628849", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 448, "textEnd": 454}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 2303, "textEnd": 2308}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Despite polling highly over the last four years, Sinn Fein has not gained the surge in votes that was predicted in the local elections. Mr O\u2019Brien said that \u201cthis was a party that was apparently just going to waltz into Government\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously clear that we\u2019ve parts of the country where they\u2019re in single digits, Dublin probably at 11 (or) 12%. They can\u2019t be satisfied with that performance,\u201d he told RTE Radio 1. \u201cOf course, they\u2019ll make gains because they\u2019re coming from a very low base of about 9%. \u201cI don\u2019t think the main opposition party can be satisfied with a gain like that.\u201d Mr O\u2019Brien was asked if the \u201cpositive results\u201d for Fine Gael and Fianna Fail in the Europe elections means that the Irish general election should be held earlier than March next year, but he disagreed. \u201cWe have been very clear. We\u2019ve an important budget to do in the autumn, we\u2019ve important legislation to pass like the Planning and Development Bill which is advancing through the Dail,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect as the three leaders have said, the Taoiseach (Simon Harris), Tanaiste (Micheal Martin) and Minister (Eamon) Ryan, that the Government will do its course. \u201cWe have important work to do. Yes, of course, the results here today and for government parties are good because we want good councillors running our local authorities and representing our people. \u201cThe European elections obviously we\u2019ll know later on today as well. \u201cI expect the Government to see out its term.\u201d Sinn Fein TD David Cullinane said the party is \u201cnot where we want to be\u201d. Indications show that the party has won around 11% of first preference votes based on declarations so far in the local elections. The party won 24.5% in the 2020 general election and had been polling above 30% until recent polls indicated a slide in their support. Mr Cullinane warned against underestimating the resilience of the Sinn Fein party and said some council seats would \u201ccome down to very complicated transfers\u201d. \u201cObviously, we expected to do better, I\u2019m not saying that it was a good result for Sinn Fein, of course I\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely there was no complacency. When we don\u2019t have a good day we accept it. \u201cWe will have to ask the questions you asked me \u2013 why did we not get the votes that we expected to get?\u201d Mr Ryan, the Green Party leader, said he believes that the incumbent MEP Ciaran Cuffe remains \u201cin the mix\u201d for a seat in the Dublin constituency. However, he has ruled out party colleague Pauline O\u2019Reilly gaining a seat in Midlands-North-West. \u201cFor the last couple of years, there\u2019s been a lot of attacks on our party, a lot of myths, untruths that we\u2019re not in supporting rural Ireland. We are. It\u2019s our first consideration,\u201d Mr Ryan added. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy environment to be in but that comes with politics so you have to try and win the argument back and try and explain why this is going to be the right transition for all of Ireland. \u201cPauline I don\u2019t think is in line for running for a seat but we are keen for her to do as best she can. \u201cWe are an all-island, right across the country, party. \u201cWe ran 130 local election campaigns and three really good European election campaigns. You don\u2019t win every time, but I think it\u2019s a hard thing to run for election. It\u2019s a real test for character when you see your vote and it doesn\u2019t come home.\u201d Meanwhile, government minister Patrick O\u2019Donovan said that Fine Gael has returned an \u201cawful lot of people\u201d. The Minister for Further and Higher Education added that there are a few \u201cunfortunately\u201d who will not make it over the line. \u201cIn my own electoral area we are getting close to 40%, the one next to me we are getting close to 38%,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very rural. So we must be doing something right in rural areas where a councillor who stood in the last election has tripled his vote, a 300% increase.\u201d Asked about the possibility of general election taking place soon, he said: \u201cIt never fails to surprise me that the king is dead, long live the king. Nobody is really looking at yesterday\u2019s results in detail. \u201cBefore we start rushing into deciding you know, there\u2019s ballot boxes here that the hinges are still warm from being open and we\u2019re talking about a general election. \u201cI would like if there could be a bit of narrative as to why is that? The people of Ireland rejected unanimously across many counties the narrative of darkness and the narrative of absolutely everything\u2019s wrong and the failed state and all of that, they rejected all of that. \u201cAt the end of it, they\u2019re looking at the United States and the United Kingdom and Irish people have decided the centre has not done us too badly over the last 102 years and it is this time to stick with the centre. That\u2019s the story of this election.\u201d", "summary": "Indications show that the party has won around 11% of first preference votes based on declarations so far in the local elections.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sinn-fein-eamon-ryan-green-party-fine-gael-dublin-b1163139.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/09/13/a1abdb282ce47ef7b95d749d2f720466Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE4MDIwMzEz-2.74864409.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:03:07", "author": "Cate McCurry", "authors": ["Cate McCurry"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.095}

James is reportedly willing to take less money to bring in players like James Harden, Klay Thompson, and Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas. Time is limited for roster changes due to James' participation in the Summer Olympics.\n\nLeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers have some work to do in the offseason.\n\nWhile James is undoubtedly delighted that the Lakers just drafted his son, Bronny James, in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft, Los Angeles still has quite a few moves it will need to make if its hopes to be contending at the top of the Western Conference next season.\n\nOn Saturday, James opted out of the final year of his contract with the Lakers in order to sign a new deal. According to a report from ESPN's Dave McMenamin, James is open to taking a pay cut, but only if it means that it helps the Lakers land another superstar.\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement. He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\" - Rich Paul\n\nJames Willing to Take Pay Cut to Land a Star Some notable names were identified as potential targets\n\nPer McMenamin, James is willing to take less than a max deal if it means the Lakers are able to use the midlevel exception to sign a difference-making player. James Harden, Klay Thompson, and big man Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas all were cited as players that could make the move worth it.\n\nIf the Lakers are unable to land a big fish in free agency, James will be looking for another max deal.\n\nMaking matters more pressing for the Lakers is the fact that all of these moves will have to be made on a condensed timeline. With James set to represent Team USA at the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris, there are only a few weeks for Rob Pelinka and company to get their ducks in a row before the ball is rolling towards the start of the next NBA season.\n\nThat said, once the dominoes of NBA free agency start falling, things tend to move pretty fast. The Lakers will likely know where they stand with the marquee free agents that are available sooner rather than later.\n\nIt's No Surprise James Is Looking to Help the Lakers Reload The Western Conference is packed with talent, and James needs some help.\n\nJames' run with the Lakers has already produced one NBA championship, but if it's going to produce another, Los Angeles is going to have to make some moves.\n\nWhile James is still playing at an elite level, he will turn 40 during the next NBA season, and there's no telling how long he'll continue to play. Bronny getting drafted will likely keep James in Los Angeles for at least a few more years, but things could change at a moment's notice.\n\nAnthony Davis is still a superstar player and great match for James on the court, but the Lakers are undoubtedly short a star. Last year, Los Angeles had to battle through the play-in tournament to reach the full NBA postseason, and they were unceremoniously ousted in the first round by the Denver Nuggets in five games.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Superstar Tandem -- Stats 2023-24 Season\n\nCategory\n\nLeBron James\n\nAnthony Davis\n\nGP\n\n71\n\n76\n\nPPG\n\n25.7\n\n24.7\n\nRPG\n\n7.3\n\n12.6\n\nAPG\n\n8.3\n\n3.5\n\nFG%\n\n54.0%\n\n55.6%\n\nWith the Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Minnesota Timberwolves already elite and likely to be better in the coming season, there is certainly room on the Lakers' roster for another star.\n\nWhether or not they are able to land one remains to be seen.\n\nRelated LeBron James Considering To Take Pay Cut To Improve Lakers' Title Hopes\n\nReports indicate that James may be willing to give up money if it means improving the Lakers' chances to compete for a championship.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Valan\u010di\u016bnas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-29-jun-2024-12-43-pm-6775.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

He signed a two-year, $97.1 million extension with Los Angeles in 2022, which included a player option for this upcoming season.\n\nJames is eligible to sign a three-year, $162 million maximum contract to return to the Lakers in free agency. He is also eligible to sign with any other team in the NBA for a maximum of $157.5 million over the next three seasons. (The NBA limits contracts for players over 38 years old to three-year maximums.)\n\nThe 39-year-old is the oldest active player in the NBA but shows no signs of slowing down. James averaged 25.7 points (on 54/41/75 shooting splits), 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds per game this past season, making the All-NBA third team. He led the Lakers to a play-in tournament berth and the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. They lost to the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nAlthough his free agency decisions are unclear, James said that he wanted to retire as a Laker during the 2024 All-Star Weekend in February.\n\n\"I am a Laker, and I've been very happy being a Laker the last six years, and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said, just before making a record-breaking 20th All-Star appearance.\n\nAnother consideration was James' son, Bronny, who was drafted by the Lakers with the No. 55 overall pick on Thursday. James has said repeatedly that he hopes to play his final NBA season with Bronny, but recently said that he won't necessarily leave the Lakers to join his son if he gets drafted by another team, and his agent Rich Paul clarified that the two are not a packaged deal.\n\nAt this point, the Philadelphia 76ers are the only championship contender with maximum salary cap space. James could also orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal elsewhere or sign anywhere for as little as the veteran minimum, though Paul all but ruled out the latter to ESPN's Jonathan Givony.\n\n\"LeBron is also not going to Phoenix for a minimum deal,\" said Paul. \"We can squash that now.\"\n\nAt the very least, James will take a pay cut for the 2024-25 season.

James is expected to re-sign with the Lakers after they drafted his son Bronny. James could potentially sign a three-year, $162 million contract that will keep him in LA until the 2026-27 season.\n\nAs widely expected, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James will opt of his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 NBA season, Shams Charania of The Athletic reported. This will officially make James an unrestricted free agent as free agency looms on June 30th.\n\nDespite hitting the market, James is not expected to leave Tinseltown and should promptly sign a new deal with the Lakers, especially after they drafted his son, Bronny James, with the 55th overall pick during Thursday's NBA Draft.\n\nThe King could sign a three-year, $162 million contract, which will lock him up in Los Angeles until the 2026-27 season.

He officially did so and will now enter unrestricted free agency for the first time since the 2018 offseason, per Shams Charania of The Athletic:\n\nWhile most reports have noted that James is expected to return to the Lakers this offseason, anything can happen when a player hits free agency.\n\nJames is still at the top of his game and there will be teams trying to lure him away from the glamour of Hollywood. However, there aren't many teams that have the cap space to outright sign James for what he is looking for. James will be looking for a max deal so the majority of the league is already out unless a sign-and-trade were to occur.\n\nRead more: Draymond Green Has High Praise for Bronny James, Lakers for Drafting Him\n\nThe only team that may present some possible competition for the Lakers, in terms of being able to offer James a maximum salary while still being on a contender, is the Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers are expected to have a max contract slot open in cap space and they could pair him with stars Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. It could be an intriguing option for the NBA's all-time leading scorer and he showed some level of interest in Philadelphia before signing with the Lakers in 2018.\n\nHowever, with the Lakers hiring former NBA guard JJ Redick to be the next head coach of the team and drafting his son, Bronny James, the likelihood of LeBron James leaving is even slimmer. He could become the first-ever father-son duo to play in the NBA together by returning to the Lakers, creating even more NBA history. James also has established himself in the city and retiring with the Purple and Gold makes a lot of sense for him.\n\nRead more: Lakers to Hire JJ Redick as Next Head Coach\n\nHe has delivered a title to Los Angeles already so anything else he does now is a cherry on top. But that doesn't mean he doesn't still have a strong desire to win. The Lakers will do what they can to field a competitive team around James to see if he can add more titles to his legendary resume.

The expectation is James will return to the Lakers on a new deal.\n\nJames, who turns 40 on Dec. 30, has until 5 p.m. ET Saturday to officially decide whether to opt into his player option for 2024-25.\n\nThe max the Lakers could offer him as a free agent is three years and $160 million based on current cap guidance. The other option to guarantee James' return to the Lakers would be for him to opt into his $51.4 million deal for next season and then sign an extension in late August.\n\nThe Athletic previously reported the Lakers wanted James to return, were open to offering him a maximum extension and were willing to draft his son Bronny this year. That happened Thursday when the Lakers selected Bronny with the 55th overall pick in the NBA Draft, capping a year of questions surrounding Bronny's future in the game.\n\nJames has long expressed a desire to play with Bronny in the pros, famously telling The Athletic in 2022: \"My last year (in the NBA) will be played with my son.\" The superstar forward modified that sentiment in 2023, telling ESPN his goal would also be realized playing with Bronny \"either in the same uniform or (in) a matchup against him.\"\n\nIn his six years as a Laker, James has averaged 27.0 points per game in the regular season and accumulated 9,436 of his more than NBA-record 40,474 career regular-season points. In his four postseason trips with Los Angeles, he's averaged 26.1 points per game and helped lead the Lakers to an NBA title in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shams_charania@nytimes.com", "name": "Shams Charania", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jenna_west@nytimes.com", "name": "Jenna West", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/03/02175201/GettyImages-2048477857-scaled-e1709420002342.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-30", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 265}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Knecht will wear No. 4, generating the clever nickname \"Knecht Four.\"\n\nBut LeBron focused more on his son, who chose No. 9. It's a change from the No. 6 Bronny James wore at USC, which his dad has worn at various points during his illustrious 21-year career.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James with pick No. 55 overall in the second round. They are the NBA's first father-son duo. LeBron has talked about wanting to close out his career playing with his son. Now, it's a reality.\n\n\"I need to be on the floor with my boy, I got to be on the floor with Bronny,\" James told ESPN in 2023. \"Either in the same uniform or a matchup against him. ... I would love to do the whole Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr. thing. That would be ideal for sure.\"\n\nBronny James averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 19.4 minutes per game in his only college season at USC.\n\nLeBron James' Los Angeles co-star Anthony Davis was a fan of the team picking up Bronny. Davis can see the younger James evolving into a solid player.\n\n\"He's very good defensively,\" Davis told ESPN. \"He can read the floor very well. I think he's a really good playmaker. I saw him work out a couple times besides the [Klutch Sports] pro day and working with a big -- his reads, reading the defense, making the right passes -- that was really impressive to me. He's going to be fine, man. Obviously it's a lot of pressure on him with his dad being who he is.\n\n\"But one thing about Bronny, from what I've seen and what I heard, he wants to create his own path and he doesn't want to be -- even though he's LeBron James' son, he don't want be seen as that. And I think having that mindset and trying to create his own path is going to work out for him. ... Who knows, he might come in and be ready to play for us.\"\n\nOther stars around the league, including Golden State Warriors veteran Draymond Green, also commented on Bronny's being picked by the Lakers.\n\n\"I am just gonna take the bet that this kid works hard, which he does. He has LeBron James DNA and I am gonna take the bet on that...and then you watch him play, he is a good basketball player,\" Green said on his podcast. \"I'm goin to take that bet because you got him at 55, so he even becomes a rotation player, you did great and I think he could possibly become a rotational player in the next two years.\"\n\nThe father-son duo playing together isn't completely locked in just yet. LeBron James is weighing a $51.4 million player option. He's expected to opt-out, although that doesn't mean he's leaving LA.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Dave McMenamin, the Lakers are willing to offer James the maximum three-year, $162 million deal. That would likely keep James in LA for the rest of his career. James hasn't given much insight on his decision outside of a message shortly after the Lakers were bounced from the postseason.\n\n\"I've seen, heard a lot of reports about my future. I said it last night and I'll say it again. I do not know yet as I'm only thinking about spending time with my family & friends!\" James wrote on April 30. \"When I know after speaking with the fam, my counsel as well as my representation about it then you guys will know. Until then [quiet].\"\n\nJames will likely return to the Lakers now that his son is part of the organization. Additionally, the team hired JJ Redick as their head coach.

This decision follows a series of strategic moves by the Lakers, including the selection of his son, Bronny James, with the No. 55 overall pick in the NBA Draft, and the hiring of his podcast co-host, JJ Redick, as their head coach.\n\nJames is eligible for a new three-year deal worth a projected $160 million, which would include a no-trade clause, an element he could not have included in a mere contract extension.\n\nBy opting out and signing a new contract, James secures both financial and strategic advantages, ensuring that any future trade would require his approval. This move provides James with greater control over his career trajectory as he continues to play at an elite level.\n\nSince joining the Lakers in 2018, James has been a cornerstone of the franchise, leading them to an NBA championship in 2020. If he signs the anticipated three-year deal, his tenure with the Lakers could extend to nine seasons, surpassing his initial seven-year stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nDespite turning 40 next season, James continues to defy age, maintaining impressive averages of 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game last season.\n\nThe Lakers, under General Manager Rob Pelinka, have emphasized the importance of balancing immediate success with long-term development. This approach is evident in their recent draft picks and the potential for further roster upgrades. The Lakers need to address their weaknesses and build a team capable of contending for a championship, particularly given their early playoff exit last season at the hands of the Denver Nuggets.\n\nJames' decision to opt-out is a calculated move, allowing him to leverage his position and ensure that the Lakers remain committed to building a competitive roster around him. The Lakers' management is likely prepared for this development and is expected to make the necessary adjustments to retain their star player and enhance the team's championship prospects.\n\nWhile LeBron James' opt-out may initially appear to introduce uncertainty, all signs point to his continued presence with the Lakers. This strategic move aims to secure his legacy and position the team for future success, reinforcing the mutual commitment between James and the Lakers organization.\n\nThe Lakers Have To Give LeBron James A Chance By Building A Strong Roster\n\nThe Lakers must seize the opportunity to give LeBron James a legitimate chance to win another title before he concludes his illustrious career. With reports suggesting that LeBron will likely sign a three-year extension, this would extend his career to an unprecedented 24 seasons in the NBA.\n\nLeBron has achieved an extraordinary amount in his career, but his drive for another championship remains undiminished. Remarkably, even in his 21st year, LeBron is still considered a top 10 talent in the league, a feat unparalleled in NBA history. The four-time champion, four-time MVP, and 20-time All-Star is now playing alongside his son, Bronny James, fulfilling a long-held dream. The possibility of winning a championship with his son only heightens his motivation.\n\nTo honor LeBron's legacy and maximize this unique opportunity, the Lakers need to build a robust roster around him and Anthony Davis. This means making strategic moves in the offseason to bring in key players who can complement their play styles and elevate the team's overall performance.\n\nThe Lakers' management must be willing to make the necessary financial commitments, even if it means paying the luxury tax due to surpassing the second apron. They are already over the first luxury tax threshold, indicating a willingness to invest in a championship-caliber team.\n\nThe Lakers need to be aggressive in free agency and potential trades to acquire seasoned veterans and young talents who can contribute immediately. Role players who can provide consistent scoring, defensive prowess, and depth are crucial to the team's success.\n\nLeBron's window for winning another championship is narrowing, but his performance and leadership continue to inspire. The Lakers must capitalize on this by assembling a team that can compete at the highest level.\n\nWith LeBron's experience and determination, combined with a well-rounded and capable supporting cast, the Lakers can make a serious run at another title. It is not just about honoring LeBron's legacy; it is about giving a legendary player the tools he needs to achieve greatness once more. The time for the Lakers to act is now, ensuring that LeBron has every chance to add another championship to his storied career.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Terrible move for Bronny and the Lakers.\n\nShame on Jeanie Buss, shame on Rob Pelinka and shame on the Lakers organization for selling their soul to team James. Nothing against Bronny, but the younger James wasn't even good enough to have any meaningful impact at USC. So not only have the Lakers wasted a second-round pick on Bronny, but more important, these actions will potentially cost a deserving youngster a valuable spot in a very limited NBA players pool.\n\nLakers use a valuable draft pick on Bronny James? In high school, Bronny didn't even make his all-league first team. On a very bad USC team last year, he didn't start and averaged less than five points a game.

While retirement talk has bubbled up a bit over the last two years, there was little doubt James would keep playing with his son in the NBA.\n\nCould James really pass on the opportunity to be teammates with Bronny? Here's what you need to know about the reasoning behind the NBA great's decision to become a free agent.\n\nMORE: Tracking the latest LeBron James free agency rumors\n\nJames is expected to sign a new deal with the Lakers, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania. While that might not stop certain teams from trying to lure him away, the report comes as no surprise after the selection of his son and the hiring of his close friend, JJ Redick, as head coach.\n\nSo, why would James opt out at all? There are a few benefits.\n\nRather than play out the final season of his contract for $51.4 million, James is eligible to sign a three-year, $162 million deal to stay in Los Angeles. That's not only an increase of $2.6 million for the 2024-25 season, but it affords the four-time NBA champion more long-term security through his 24th season.\n\nA new deal in free agency would also allow James to secure a no-trade clause, if he wishes. A no-trade clause would not have been possible with a simple extension keeping him off the open market. It's highly unlikely the Lakers would trade James without his permission to begin with, but most players value that kind of security.\n\nJames' foray into free agency could also put pressure on the Lakers to upgrade their roster. If he isn't happy with the way the team is built, James could entertain interest from other teams and force GM Rob Pelinka's hand to trade for an impact player.\n\nIt's not uncommon for James to enter free agency without any expectation of leaving his current team. He opted-out of his deal with the Cavaliers in both 2015 and 2016 despite no realistic chance of exiting Cleveland. James even remained a free agent for six weeks in 2016, not re-signing with the Cavaliers until mid-August, without any speculation that he might sign elsewhere.\n\nLakers fans shouldn't panic despite the uncertainty of James entering free agency. After recent moves by the franchise, it would be a giant surprise to see the all-time points leader leave Los Angeles.\n\nMORE: NBA players react to Lakers' Bronny James selection\n\nJames is eligible to sign a three-year, $162 million contract to return to the Lakers. That would pay him $54 million per year through the 2026-27 season, which would be his 24th in the NBA.\n\nA long-term contract doesn't by any means guarantee that James isn't retiring until 2027, but it does provide long-term security and potentially a no-trade clause that puts the star in control of his future. The contract would also boost his salary from the $51.4 million mark that he would've made if he had exercised his player option.\n\nJames is set to cruise past $500 million in career earnings next season, simply from NBA contracts alone.\n\nJames is 39 years old. He's set to turn 40 on Dec. 30.\n\nIt goes without saying James has been otherworldly in recent years considering his age and the ridiculous amount of wear-and-tear on his body. James averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game in his age-39 season, posting his highest field goal percentage in seven years.\n\nWhile 40-year-olds don't typically make $54 million per year, let alone actively play in the NBA at all, the Lakers aren't expected to have any qualms about giving James the contract he's looking for.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/nba-plain--5ccbd1e5-7f8f-422d-967d-e37372070057.jpeg?itok=yqy_g-WU", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-30", "textStart": 3292, "textEnd": 3299}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

LeBron gave a two-word reaction on social media to his son's choice of what number to wear for the club.\n\n\"No Words!\" James posted to Instagram, when Bronny chose the no. 9 to wear for his jersey. Bronny was drafted by the Lakers in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nThe two are now the first father and son to ever play together in the NBA. There is a lot of change in the air for the Lakers this coming year, as JJ Redick is also the new head coach for the team. Redick is a former league player who has never held a head coaching position in the NBA.\n\nThe Lakers and their fans hope that the James duo, as well as Redick, can bring a NBA Championship back to the city. Los Angeles bowed to the Denver Nuggets in this year's Western Conference playoffs. The Lakers lost to Denver in five games. The franchise last won the NBA Finals in 2020, and Lakers fans are getting restless.\n\nBronny James will have to answer questions as an NBA player\n\nBronny James was considered by many to be a surprise NBA Draft pick. Bronny did not have a strong season in college basketball, playing for USC in 2023-24. The Trojans missed the NCAA tournament, and finished with a losing season. Bronny averaged under 5 points a game, playing in a limited role due to a heart injury. The team did find some rhythm as the season was about to end, but Bronny didn't have a single game scoring in double figures after a January 17 contest against Arizona.\n\nCritics say Bronny is only with the Lakers because of his dad, LeBron. It could be considered fair criticism, but Bronny will surely get his chance to prove his doubters wrong. The young star reportedly had a strong showing in the NBA Combine, and several other franchises were rumored to want Bronny in the draft. In the end, he is headed to Los Angeles, where he will team with his dad and Anthony Davis to try and win another title.\n\nThe Lakers were rumored this offseason to have to fight to keep LeBron. It seems the team won't have that problem now. The 20-plus year veteran averaged nearly 26 points this past season. He also grabbed 7 rebounds a contest. Despite his age, LeBron still has plenty of gas in the tank.

LeBron's potential pay cut would make the Lakers eligible for the full midlevel exception. The Lakers could target players like Derrick Jones Jr. and Jonas Valanciunas.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers star LeBron James will officially become an unrestricted free agent after he reportedly intends to opt out of his $51.4 million player option. Nonetheless, James isn't expected to leave Los Angeles and should re-sign with the Lakers on a new contract.\n\nThough James is eligible to sign a maximum deal worth $162 million over the next three years, the four-time NBA champion could take a paycut to enhance the Lakers' chances of competing for a championship. Senior NBA Insider Chris Haynes of TNT and Bleacher Report noted that James is considering taking less money so that the Lakers can open up the full midlevel exception in free agency.\n\nWhat LeBron James Taking Pay Cut Means for Lakers L.A. can target more free agents\n\nThis isn't the first time that James has taken a pay cut in order to enhance his team's chances of winning a championship. He did so back in 2010 when he, along with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, all took less money to join forces with the Miami Heat. With the Lakers still needing more pieces to improve, James may be willing to do the same now that he is in the twilight of his career.\n\nIf James inks a max deal, this would take the Lakers over the first apron, which makes them eligible for the taxpayers' midlevel exception. This means they can only sign a player for a two-year deal worth up to $10.6 million.\n\nShould James take a pay cut, Los Angeles will be eligible for the full midlevel exception. This will allow the Lakers to offer a contract with a starting salary of $12.9 million and up to $55.3 million over the next four years.\n\nBut how much would James need to give up to make this happen? ESPN's Brian Windhorst hinted on his podcast about this possibility a couple of days ago and projected that the Lakers star could give up around $10 to $12 million and sign a contract in the $38 to $39 million range annually.\n\nLakers' Potential Targets in Free Agency James is still seeking to win his fifth NBA championship\n\nIf James is indeed willing to take a salary hit, this obviously increases the Lakers' pool of potential targets in free agency. Not only is there more money in what they can offer, they could also extend a longer deal.\n\nGrant Asfeth floated the idea of the Lakers going after free agent wing Derrick Jones Jr., who recently moved to Klutch Sports Group, the same agency that James and his co-star Anthony Davis are with.\n\nJones had a terrific campaign with the Dallas Mavericks and was a key starter in their run to the NBA Finals. Dallas, however, has been able to clear up the cap room to re-sign Jones in free agency via the same full MLE the Lakers are trying to vie for.\n\nAnother potential target for Los Angeles is Jonas Valanciunas, who has been linked to the Lakers at some point this summer. Valanciunas would be a great addition to shore up the front line for Los Angeles and allow Davis to play his preferred power forward position.\n\nNonetheless, nothing is set in stone just yet. The Lakers will likely still need to convince James to make this move and a lot of that will be dependent on who they can realistically bring in to increase their chances of giving The King his fifth NBA championship.\n\nRelated Lakers' LeBron James Will Become Unrestricted Free Agent\n\nJames is expected to sign a new deal with the Lakers in free agency.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bosh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Valan\u010di\u016bnas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-29-jun-2024-02-59-pm-204.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He signed a two-year, $97.1 million extension with Los Angeles in 2022, which included a player option for this upcoming season.\n\nJames is eligible to sign a three-year, $162 million maximum contract to return to the Lakers in free agency. He is also eligible to sign with any other team in the NBA for a maximum of $157.5 million over the next three seasons. (The NBA limits contracts for players over 38 years old to three-year maximums.)\n\nThe 39-year-old is the oldest active player in the NBA but shows no signs of slowing down. James averaged 25.7 points (on 54/41/75 shooting splits), 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds per game this past season, making the All-NBA third team. He led the Lakers to a play-in tournament berth and the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. They lost to the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nAlthough his free agency decisions are unclear, James said that he wanted to retire as a Laker during the 2024 All-Star Weekend in February.\n\n\"I am a Laker, and I've been very happy being a Laker the last six years, and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said, just before making a record-breaking 20th All-Star appearance.\n\nAnother consideration was James's son, Bronny, who was drafted by the Lakers with the No. 55 overall pick on Thursday. James has said repeatedly that he hopes to play his final NBA season with Bronny, but recently said that he won't necessarily leave the Lakers to join his son if he gets drafted by another team, and his agent Rich Paul clarified that the two are not a packaged deal.\n\nAt this point, the Philadelphia 76ers are the only championship contender with maximum salary cap space. James could also orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal elsewhere or sign anywhere for as little as the veteran minimum, though Paul all but ruled out the latter to ESPN's Jonathan Givony.\n\n\"LeBron is also not going to Phoenix for a minimum deal,\" said Paul. \"We can squash that now.\"\n\nAt the very least, James will take a pay cut for the 2024-25 season. His maximum starting salary of $50 million is almost $1.5 million less than was his option to play for the Lakers. By becoming a free agent, he can now negotiate a no-trade clause with the Lakers in addition to securing a longer-term contract. This remains the most likely scenario. James' family and non-basketball business are based in Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pSMBWfJ76YjqZZVOqmdP3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/087e1f50-3633-11ef-9ff7-07ec190109cc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

So far this offseason, the Lakers have selected his son, Bronny James, with the No. 55 overall pick in the NBA Draft, and they have also hired his Mind the Game podcast co-host, JJ Redick, as their head coach.\n\nJames is eligible for a three-year deal worth a projected $162 million to return to Los Angeles as a free agent. Because he has at least eight total years of NBA experience and has spent at least four years with the Lakers, he is also eligible for a no-trade clause in this deal.\n\nJames could have potentially signed an extension with the Lakers for a slightly higher price. The total amount on such an extension would have been roughly $164.3 million over three years. The reason such an extension would have paid James more is that his player option amount, which was based on an 8% raise built into his last contract, was higher than his max on the open market, which would have been a 5% raise on his previous salary. However, had James extended, he would not have been eligible for a no-trade clause, as those can only be added to new deals rather than existing ones.\n\nJames has spent the past six seasons with the Lakers. If he signs that three-year max deal with the Lakers and doesn't move before it ends, his total Lakers tenure will have lasted nine seasons. That would top his first seven-year tenure with the the Cleveland Cavaliers for the longest stretch with a single team in his career. In total, though, he would need to play 11 seasons with the Lakers to match his overall time with the Cavaliers, as he went on to play four more years in Cleveland later on.\n\nThe Lakers won 47 games a year ago and were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Reports have indicated that James still hopes to compete for championships, but the Lakers, thus far, have not made significant moves to improve. They landed Dalton Knecht at No. 17 overall in the draft, but they have not made a substantial veteran addition yet this offseason. The Lakers have preached patience and player development so far this offseason, but as James will turn 40 next season, they will have to find a balance between the present and future.\n\nGeneral manager Rob Pelinka has in the past said that the Lakers need to be \"caretakers\" of James' legacy as one of the greatest players in NBA history. That has meant investing in immediate winning, and after losing in the first round, upgrades will be needed to put this team in a position to genuinely compete this season. Only time will tell if the Lakers are able to make those moves, but if James does indeed stay on a new deal, he will be entrusting the team to do so.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/31/3bface29-0cc8-466c-8911-08400c55dca1/thumbnail/1200x675/c993b4e74904ae0935ad485fa0ea4b14/lebron-james-lakers-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nThe move is among those coming just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected that LeBron James would technically be a free agent.

And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists last season -- as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_reynolds@gazette.com", "name": "Tim Reynolds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Barnes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Barnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immanuel Quickley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

He of course came back and had another exceptional year for the Lakers though, showing that he is still capable of playing at an All-NBA level even at his age.\n\nThis offseason is different though as while retirement never seemed like a possibility for LeBron, leaving the Lakers is. He came into the summer with a player option for just over $51 million, but the expectation all along was that he would decline it to sign a bigger contract with L.A. or maybe even to test free agency and see what else is out there.\n\nWhile the expectation isn't necessarily that James will leave, especially now that the team has drafted his son Bronny James, he has indeed declined his player option to become a free agent, per Shams Charania of The Athletic:\n\nReports indicated early in the offseason that the Lakers are willing to offer James any contract he is interested in, including the maximum three-year, $164 million extension. As he gets set to enter his 22nd season while turning 40 later this year, the expectation is that James will play at least two more years.\n\nAt this stage of his career, James is only interested in competing for championships so the Lakers obviously have some work to do to get to that level. It will be fascinating to see if LeBron inks an extension before Rob Pelinka and the front office make their offseason moves, or if he will wait to see what the roster looks like before deciding on his future with the organization.\n\nThey did end up hiring his friend and podcast co-host JJ Redick to be their head coach though, in addition to drafting Bronny, so all indications remain that James will stay in L.A.\n\nOne thing that will be important moving forward is LeBron James' vision being aligned with the Lakers', and that starts up top with owner and governor Jeanie Buss.\n\nAccording to recent reports, James and Buss' relationship is currently 'better than ever' which is a good sign that the Lakers will be able to keep the superstar in the purple and gold for next season and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_starkand@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Daniel Starkand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/LeBron-James-64.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Hopefully it is with the Lakers. It's a great organization and so many greats. But we'll see. I don't know how it's going to end (NBA playing career), but it's coming. It's coming, for sure.\"\n\nIf James wants to play elsewhere, he can get a three-year contract worth $157.5 million. Now, there aren't many teams with the kind of cap space available to sign James at the salary he wants. His agent Rich Paul, the CEO of Klutch Sports, shot down the idea of James signing a minimum contract to play for a contender. If James wants to remain on a competitive team, that narrows his options outside of the Lakers.\n\nHe averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals and shot 54% from the field and a career-high 41% on 3-pointers in 71 games in 2023-24 as he made the All-Star team for the 20th consecutive season and earned his 20th All-NBA selection.\n\nThe Lakers were eliminated from the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets for the second consecutive season - the Western Conference finals last season and first round this season.\n\nJames performed well in the playoffs, scoring at least 26 points in the five games, including 30 in Game 4 and 30 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds and four steals in Game 5, and shooting better than 50% from the field. But the gap between the two teams was exposed by Denver's second-half execution and the Lakers' slim margin of error.\n\nFollow NBA reporter Jeff Zillgitt on social media @JeffZillgitt\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: LeBron James opts out: Lakers star enters NBA free agency", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_zillgitt@aol.com", "name": "Jeff Zillgitt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Weekend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zgk.GzdP01iNwdYbCD8puw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/e3a546c6aa0147e9fc9a600622c80055", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-30", "textStart": 678, "textEnd": 685}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Paul George and Klay Thompson may simply be on the move to new teams.\n\nAnd the NBA's free agency period, which officially starts Sunday, suddenly has some intrigue.\n\nJames did not exercise his option to accept what would have been a $51.4 million contract for this coming season and instead is seeking a new deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, a person with knowledge of the decision said Saturday.\n\nThe terms of the new deal could be finalized quickly, said the person, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither James nor the Lakers revealed the decision publicly. ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, George made a similar decision, the nine-time All-Star choosing to not opt-in for what would have been a $48.8 million contract this coming season with the Los Angeles Clippers -- a team that he's spent the past five years with, averaging 23 points per game. He'll become a free agent and is planning to talk to the Clippers about a new deal and also intends to hear pitches from Orlando and Philadelphia, plus potentially others, a person briefed on George's plans told AP on Saturday night.\n\nSaturday's moves came just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected James technically would be a free agent. It's also been expected he would stay with the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James, LeBron James' oldest son, Thursday in the second round of the draft, putting them in position to have the first on-court father-son duo in NBA history. And with a new deal, it's even possible LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement,\" James' agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, told ESPN on Saturday. \"He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists last season -- as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nAnd if he's going to leave money on the table, he's going to want a player who can help the Lakers contend for a title again. Among the Lakers' potential targets: Golden State's Thompson, a free agent who could be on the move for the first time in his career.\n\nThompson, a starter on all four of the Warriors' championship teams of this era and half of the famed \"Splash Brothers\" duo alongside 3-point king Stephen Curry, has spent all 13 of his NBA years with Golden State. And his status -- will he go back to the Warriors or not? -- is one of the biggest questions that'll be answered in the coming days. It may not be financially possible for Golden State to retain Thompson.\n\n\"We want him back. We've said that all along,\" Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy said June 24. \"Hopefully he'll come back. But as far as the specifics and discussions and those types of things, I think it's important to keep in-house and that stuff. When we figure out a solution to all that, we'll have news for you.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@triblive.com",

ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, George made a similar decision, the nine-time All-Star choosing to not opt-in for what would have been a $48.8 million contract this coming season with the Los Angeles Clippers -- a team that he's spent the past five years with, averaging 23 points per game.

The Lakers selected former USC basketball guard Bronny James with their 55th pick. James' impeding professional debut has countless fans and athletes excited. One such athlete is former Lakers guard Nick Van Exel. LeBron James showed love for Van Excel after his Bronny James' draft praise.\n\nThis, of course, prompted a gracious response from LeBron James:\n\n\"That's so TOUGH!! Nick the Quick was cold!\" James responded.\n\nNick Van Exel spent 13 years in the NBA, with his first five seasons coming with the Lakers. Van Excel earned two key honors with Los Angeles. He made the 1993-94 All-Rookie Team and earned his first and lone All-Star appearance with the Lakers in 1997-98. The 6'1'' guard ended his NBA tenure with averages of 14.4 points and 6.6 assists.\n\nLeBron James was ecstatic to see Nick Van Excel support his son Bronny. But nobody was more excited than LeBron James himself. He wrote a touching message the day before the Lakers drafted Bronny to him and his brother Bryce.\n\n\"Not a feeling better in the f*** world than me being around raising my boys to MEN! Pops over here getting emotional as hell just thinking about y'all journey so far! Thank you both for allowing me to be your DAD and be a part of your compass through life's trials and tribulations! James wrote on Instagram alongside a series of endearing emojis.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Bronny and Byrce James continue their impressive endeavors.\n\nBronny James turns a new chapter with the Lakers\n\nLos Angeles is hoping to bounce back from their 2024 first-round playoff exit. Bronny James may not immediately contribute to the team's ascent, but with time, he looks to make a big impact.\n\nJames averaged just 4.9 points and 0.8 steals during his freshman season with USC. His numbers were a contract to his high school senior production. James averaged 13.8 points and 1.8 steals during his final year at Sierra Canyon. However, his stats do not tell the full story.\n\nIn July of 2023, James suffered a cardiac arrest during a USC basketball practice. Thankfully, he fully recovered and returned to the court, but his rhythm was understandably not the same. Despite James' down freshman season, he impressed NBA Combine scouts with his vertical leap and pro lane agility performances. In addition, he bolstered the perception of his offensive abilities by scoring 13 points in his second scrimmage and performing well in shooting drills.\n\nLos Angeles believes Bronny James will have a bright NBA future. In the meantime, LeBron James will hold things down. James is coming off an impressive 2023-24 season. Through 71 games, the star forward averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds, 1.3 blocks, and 1.1 steals. In addition, he shot a career-high 41.0 percent on three-pointers. James and the rest of Los Angeles want to continue his all-around production to help the Lakers to an improved showing in 2024-25.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Van_Exel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Van Exel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Rookie_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Rookie Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Canyon_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Canyon School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/LeBron-James-shows-love-for-ex-LA-star-over-Bronny-James-approval.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

James was due to make $51.4 million if he exercised his player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nESPN reports the Lakers are \"committed to keeping James with the franchise\" and are willing to offer him a maximum, three-year, $162 million deal. While that is the max deal James is eligible for, the two sides could come to another agreement once they begin negotiating.\n\nJames just finished his sixth season with the Lakers and has maintained an incredible level of play as he has aged. He was named third team All-NBA during the 2023-24 campaign while averaging 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists in 35.2 minutes per game. He also shot a career-best 41% from three-point range and made 54% of his shots from the field.\n\nOn Friday, the Lakers deepened James's connection to the franchise by selecting his son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nLos Angeles is fully built around James at this point, so it's not shocking the two sides would like to continue their partnership. The Lakers hired his podcast co-host JJ Redick as their new head coach a few days before selecting Bronny in the draft.\n\nThe all-time great appears ready to end his career with the Lakers. The partnership has been successful, as James led the franchise to an NBA title in '20. But during his time in LA, the team has missed the playoffs twice, been eliminated in the first round twice and was swept in the conference finals in '23. Those results likely aren't up to James's standards.\n\nJames appears set to be back with the Lakers.

They fired Darvin Ham, who didn't exactly get strong votes of confidence from his stars, and hired JJ Redick, who rather famously hosted a podcast with James in the second half of the season.\n\nIn the Draft, after landing Dalton Knecht in the first round, they used the 55th pick to take Bronny James and give LeBron the chance to fulfill his dream of playing in NBA games with his son. Saturday was the deadline for players and teams to pick up or decline contract options, and as most expected, LeBron declined his $51.4 million option to enter free agency officially -- with the expectation that he will re-sign in Los Angeles.\n\nThere have been rumblings that James could get as much as a 3-year deal from the Lakers, as the soon-to-be-40-year-old could play for a few more years. The question is how much of the Lakers money will end up tied up in the oldest player in the NBA, and according to Chris Haynes, James will be \"considering\" taking less than the max to free up the full mid-level exception for the Lakers to add more talent to the roster.\n\nJames would likely need to see a full plan from Rob Pelinka and the front office for how they'll use that money. He also could use this as a further bargaining chip to pressure the Lakers into being more aggressive on the trade market in using their future picks to acquire immediate talent. If he were willing to take less and open up the mid-level to add a quality rotation piece, and the Lakers could add an upgrade on the trade market, that would certainly make them a more formidable contender in the West.

ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nThe move is among those coming just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected that LeBron James would technically be a free agent. It's also been expected that he would stay with the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James -- LeBron James' oldest son -- on Thursday in the second round of the draft, putting them in position to have the first on-court father-son duo in NBA history. And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league.

If LeBron Sr. picks up his $51.4 million player option for next season, he would guarantee he'll get to take his son to work in the fall.\n\nWith their two major moves this week, the Lakers have made it clear they're determined to stick with James as their centerpiece and leader through his record-tying 22nd NBA season this fall and beyond.\n\nLos Angeles' new coach is JJ Redick, who hosted the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with James this year. Redick is a 15-year NBA veteran who has never coached an adult basketball game, yet the Lakers quickly made the unusual choice of hiring the broadcaster after Dan Hurley turned them down. Pelinka didn't deny that Redick's compatibility with James was a plus.\n\nThe Lakers then used the 55th overall pick on Bronny, who put up modest statistics in his only year of college at Southern Cal.\n\nPelinka and the Lakers scouted Bronny James extensively, and he performed solidly at the pre-draft camp and again in a workout at the Lakers' training complex, which was followed by a meeting with Pelinka. Pelinka said he never even asked Bronny what he thought about the potential pressure of playing alongside his father -- something that even LeBron has said Bronny wasn't necessarily eager to do.\n\n\"We really kept the draft process to Bronny being a Laker, and what we felt like we needed to do to help him become great,\" Pelinka said. \"We didn't talk a lot about that, just because (we) wanted to respect his dad's decision as a free agent, so that wasn't really something that came up.\"\n\nJames could pick up his option for 2024-25, or he could sign a new extension for even more money. He could get a maximum threeyear, $162 million deal that would give him the longest career in NBA history if he played out the contract.\n\nEither option would likely be just fine with Lakers Owner Jeanie Buss, who showed a similarly passionate loyalty to Kobe Bryant when she pushed to give him a $48.5 million extension for the final two seasons of his career despite his growing injury problems.\n\nBronny likely doesn't the get Lakers closer to winning now, but their choice with the 17th overall pick just might: Dalton Knecht, the high-scoring Tennessee wing who won the SEC Player of the Year award, appears to be one of the most pro-ready players in the draft, and not just because he's already 23 years old.\n\n\"In my mind, I thought there's no way a player that skilled would be available to us (at No. 17),\" Pelinka said.\n\nPelinka has repeatedly tried to keep fan expectations low for a major player addition to a team that lost to Denver in the first round of the postseason, instead targeting incremental improvements to the core around James and Anthony Davis -- along with a potential upgrade on the bench from Redick's innovative basketball mind.", "source":

If LeBron Sr. picks up his $51.4 million player option for next season this week, he would guarantee he'll get to take his son to work in the fall.\n\nPelinka was careful not to get ahead of himself while triumphantly discussing Bronny's potential, but the GM acknowledged that a father-son pairing in purple and gold was \"something that could be magical.\"\n\n\"We know and have to respect, of course, that LeBron has a decision about his opt-out,\" Pelinka said. \"I'm sure he and his family and his agent will deliberate what they're going to do there, and he has freedom to decide whatever is best for him and his family. But if it worked out that he was on our team next season, NBA history could be made, and NBA history should be make in a Lakers uniform.\"\n\nREAD: LeBron James wants to retire a Laker but has no NBA exit timetable\n\nWith their two major moves this week, the Lakers have made it clear they're determined to stick with LeBron as their centerpiece and leader through his record-tying 22nd NBA season this fall and beyond.\n\nLos Angeles' new coach is JJ Redick, who hosted the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron this year. Redick is a 15-year NBA veteran who has never coached an adult basketball game, yet the Lakers quickly made the unusual choice of hiring the broadcaster after Dan Hurley turned them down -- and Pelinka didn't deny that Redick's compatibility with LeBron was a plus.\n\nThe Lakers then used the 55th overall pick on Bronny, who put up modest statistics in his only year of college at Southern California. Bronny James is undeniably talented, but an identical player with a different name would have been less likely to be drafted.\n\nPelinka and the Lakers scouted Bronny James extensively, and he performed solidly at the pre-draft camp and again in a workout at the Lakers' training complex, which was followed by a meeting with Pelinka. Pelinka said he never even asked Bronny what he thought about the potential pressure of playing alongside his father -- something that even LeBron has said Bronny wasn't necessarily eager to do.\n\nREAD: Lakers coach JJ Redick still hopes to create great content with LeBron\n\n\"We really kept the draft process to Bronny being a Laker, and what we felt like we needed to do to help him become great,\" Pelinka said. \"We didn't talk a lot about that, just because (we) wanted to respect his dad's decision as a free agent, so that wasn't really something that came up.\"\n\nThat decision feels ever more like a formality now, depending on how LeBron decides to do it. The 20-time All-Star and four-time NBA champion has spoken repeatedly over the years of his desire to play a season with his son, and now the dream is a signature away from reality.\n\nLeBron could pick up his option for 2024-25, or he could sign a new extension for even more money. He could get a maximum three-year, $162 million deal that would give him the longest career in NBA history if he played out the contract.\n\nEither option would likely be just fine with Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who showed a similarly passionate loyalty to Kobe Bryant when she pushed to give him a $48.5 million extension for the final two seasons of his career despite his growing injury problems.\n\nBronny likely doesn't the get Lakers closer to winning now, but their choice with the 17th overall pick just might: Dalton Knecht, the high-scoring Tennessee wing who won the SEC Player of the Year award, appears to be one of the most pro-ready players in the draft, and not just because he's already 23 years old.\n\n\"In my mind, I thought there's no way a player that skilled would be available to us (at No. 17),\" Pelinka said.\n\nPelinka has repeatedly tried to keep fan expectations low for a major player addition to a team that lost to Denver in the first round of the postseason, instead targeting incremental improvements to the core around LeBron and Anthony Davis -- along with a potential upgrade on the bench from Redick's innovative basketball mind.\n\n\"We've explored every upgrade we could to make our team better,\" Pelinka said. \"Trades in general have just because more difficult because of the new CBA system, and so there's less access to making those big moves than maybe there was under the old system. But it didn't keep us from trying to look at everything, and ways to put ourselves in a position to be better.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sports.inquirer.net", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Segundo,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Segundo, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Segundo, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference_Men's_Basketball_Player_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sports.inquirer.net/files/2024/06/063_2150574089-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Hopefully it is with the Lakers. It's a great organization and so many greats. But we'll see. I don't know how it's going to end (NBA playing career), but it's coming. It's coming, for sure.\"\n\nIf James wants to play elsewhere, he can get a three-year contract worth $157.5 million. Now, there aren't many teams with the kind of cap space available to sign James at the salary he wants. His agent Rich Paul, the CEO of Klutch Sports, shot down the idea of James signing a minimum contract to play for a contender. If James wants to remain on a competitive team, that narrows his options outside of the Lakers.\n\nHe averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals and shot 54% from the field and a career-high 41% on 3-pointers in 71 games in 2023-24 as he made the All-Star team for the 20th consecutive season and earned his 20th All-NBA selection.\n\nThe Lakers were eliminated from the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets for the second consecutive season - the Western Conference finals last season and first round this season.\n\nJames performed well in the playoffs, scoring at least 26 points in the five games, including 30 in Game 4 and 30 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds and four steals in Game 5, and shooting better than 50% from the field.

This move comes despite James initially facing a $51.4 million player option, indicating his intent to explore new opportunities in the league.\n\nAt 37 years old and entering his remarkable 22nd NBA season, James has defied age with his enduring athleticism and skill on the court. While retirement rumors have surfaced in recent years, particularly as he nears the twilight of his career, James has consistently shown determination to continue playing, especially driven by the prospect of sharing the NBA court with his son, Bronny James.\n\nThe potential of playing alongside Bronny, who is beginning to make his mark in basketball, adds a deeply personal dimension to LeBron's decision-making process. It raises questions about whether LeBron would forego the chance to team up with his son, a scenario that has captured the imagination of basketball fans worldwide.\n\nAs James navigates this pivotal career moment, his decision will undoubtedly hinge on various factors, including team dynamics, competitive aspirations, and personal goals. Whatever path he chooses in free agency, LeBron James's legacy as one of the greatest players in NBA history remains secure, shaping the league and inspiring generations of basketball enthusiasts.\n\nLeBron James is expected to sign a new deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, according to reports from The Athletic's Shams Charania. Despite potential overtures from other teams, this decision aligns with recent developments such as the Lakers drafting his son, Bronny James, and appointing his close friend JJ Redick as head coach.\n\nBut why would LeBron opt out of his current contract at all? There are several strategic advantages for him in doing so.\n\nInstead of playing out the final season of his current contract worth $51.4 million, LeBron can negotiate a new three-year deal with the Lakers valued at $162 million. This not only provides a slight increase in earnings for the 2024-25 season but also offers him more long-term security through his potential 24th NBA season.\n\nMoreover, a new contract in free agency would enable LeBron to secure a no-trade clause, a valuable provision that ensures he cannot be traded without his consent. While it's unlikely the Lakers would trade him without his approval anyway, having a no-trade clause adds an extra layer of security and control over his future.\n\nAdditionally, LeBron's contract negotiations could create flexibility for the Lakers. Reports suggest he might seek to open up a mid-level exception, which would allow the team to bolster their roster with additional talent.\n\nLeBron's foray into free agency could also serve as a catalyst for the Lakers to further enhance their roster. If he perceives deficiencies in the team's makeup, LeBron could entertain offers from other teams, potentially forcing Lakers' GM Rob Pelinka to make moves to strengthen the squad.\n\nIt's not unusual for LeBron to enter free agency even when there's little chance of him leaving his current team. He previously opted out of his contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2015 and 2016, despite minimal speculation of him departing Cleveland. This strategic move gives him leverage in negotiations and ensures he can maximize his earnings and team benefits.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding LeBron entering free agency, Lakers fans need not panic. Given recent franchise maneuvers and LeBron's established relationship with the team, it would be surprising to see the NBA legend depart Los Angeles.

He was set to make $51.4 million next year if he opted in.\n\nBut he's not necessarily leaving the Lakers, though. The expectation is James will be back in Los Angeles next season on a new deal.\n\nJames is eligible for a max extension, which could be worth three years and $164 million. Charania recently reported the Lakers \"badly\" want James back, and after they drafted Bronny, he'll have the chance to do what no other NBA player has done by taking the court alongside his son.\n\nAs free agency gets underway Sunday night at 6 p.m. ET, James was largely expected to opt out of his deal and potentially sign a new deal. Now that Bronny is in Los Angeles after going No. 55 overall in this week's draft, LeBron will now look to make even more history next season.\n\nJames just completed his 21st NBA season and will turn 40 years old at the end of December. The league's all-time leading scorer hasn't lost a step, averaging 25.2 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists while shooting 54% from the field.\n\nJJ Redick: I want LeBron James 'shooting threes'\n\nThe Lakers made some major changes after last season, though. They moved on from Darvin Ham and hired JJ Redick as head coach just before the draft, meaning his task will be not only developing Bronny James, but helping LeBron, Anthony Davis and Co. get back on track after two straight up-and-down seasons.\n\nIt sounds like Redick, who spent the last couple years as an ESPN analyst, is ready for the pressure of coaching one of the best players of all-time. During his introductory press conference, he discussed his excitement to work with James - and the plan for the superstar to shoot more from downtown.\n\n\"With LeBron, you certainly have to get buy-in and talk to him about how he wants to play,\" JJ Redick said. \"Him and I have joked about this, but he shot over 40 percent from three this year. I want him shooting threes. He's going to have his three or four busts every game where he gets out in transition and does things that no one at his age should ever be able to do, but he does it.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_schultz@on3.com", "name": "Nick Schultz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/04/16191005/Bronny-James-LeBron-James.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

LeBron James did not exercise his option to accept what would have been a $51.4 million contract for this coming season and instead is seeking a new deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, an AP source said. / AP\n\nLEBRON James is going to move toward a new contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. Paul George and Klay Thompson may simply be on the move to new teams.\n\nAnd the NBA's free agency period, which officially starts Sunday, suddenly has some intrigue.\n\nJames did not exercise his option to accept what would have been a $51.4 million contract for this coming season and instead is seeking a new deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, a person with knowledge of the decision said Saturday.\n\nThe terms of the new deal could be finalized quickly, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither James nor the Lakers revealed the decision publicly. ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, George made a similar decision, the nine-time All-Star choosing to not opt-in for what would have been a $48.8 million contract this coming season with the Los Angeles Clippers -- a team that he's spent the past five years with, averaging 23 points per game. He'll become a free agent and is planning to talk to the Clippers about a new deal and also intends to hear pitches from Orlando and Philadelphia, plus potentially others, a person briefed on George's plans told AP on Saturday night.\n\nSaturday's moves came just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected that James would technically be a free agent. It's also been expected that he would stay with the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James -- LeBron James' oldest son -- on Thursday in the second round of the draft, putting them in position to have the first on-court father-son duo in NBA history. And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement,\" James' agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, told ESPN on Saturday. \"He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists last season -- as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nAnd if he's going to leave money on the table, he's going to want a player who can help the Lakers contend for a title again. Among the Lakers' potential targets: Golden State's Klay Thompson, a free agent who could be on the move for the first time in his career.\n\nThompson, a starter on all four of the Warriors' championship teams of this era and half of the famed \"Splash Brothers\" duo alongside 3-point king Stephen Curry, has spent all 13 of his NBA years with Golden State. And his status -- will he go back to the Warriors or not? -- is one of the biggest questions that'll be answered in the coming days. It may not be financially possible for Golden State to retain Thompson.\n\n\"We want him back. We've said that all along,\" Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy said on June 24. \"Hopefully he'll come back. But as far as the specifics and discussions and those types of things, I think it's important to keep in-house and that stuff. When we figure out a solution to all that, we'll have news for you.\" / AP", "source": {"uri": "sunstar.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun.Star Network Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

James is expected to re-sign with the Lakers and, according to Yahoo Sports, it could come with a hometown discount.\n\nJames is eligible to sign a three-year, $162 million max deal with the Lakers, but in order for Los Angeles to use its full mid-level exception -- worth approximately $13 million under the new CBA -- James would have to take at least a $20 million pay cut. If James doesn't take a pay cut, the Lakers will enter the offseason over the first apron of the salary cap, which would limit how much they can spend and send out in a potential trade.\n\nJames has only taken a pay cut once before: in 2010, when he, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh all took less money to team up on the Miami Heat. James signed a two-year, $68.6 million deal, which was $15 million less than the maximum a team could offer him in free agency.\n\nThis time around, James' incentive to take a pay cut would be to spend the twilight years of his career on a true contender. It's also worth noting that the Lakers drafted James' oldest son Bronny with the No. 55 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft on Thursday and hired James' friend and former podcast co-host JJ Redick to be their head coach.\n\nNBA free agency starts on Sunday, June 29 at 6 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bosh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1408/814/lebron1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 1373, "textEnd": 1380}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

However, he's not quite kicking the purple and gold colours to the curb yet.\n\nHis decision comes two days after the team drafted his eldest, Bronny James, at the 2024 NBA Draft. LeBron and Bronny made history, becoming the first father-son duo to be active in the league at the same time. The celebratory achievement made them teammates with the Lakers.\n\nAlso read | New York City joins India's T20 World Cup party: Watch Desi community go wild in goosebump-inducing video\n\nAs of now, LeBron has considered stepping out of the spotlight, but staying with the team in other ways, allowing his son his moment to shine in the big league. Paul also reiterated this sentiment, asserting that the James family combo would not be a package deal. He emphasised that LeBron was \"off\" the \"idea\" of them playing on the team together since he was more focussed on his son's growth in the NBA.\n\nA bigger game plan is brewing in James' mind, as explained by his agent on Saturday: \"He is prioritising a roster improvement. He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nAlthough James has opted out of his current contract with the Lakers, he's expected to stick around with the team and take a pay cut from his original contract. Either way, he's expected to share the Lakers colours with his son one way or another.\n\nAlso read | Meghan Markle 'ordered Prince Harry to ignore' David Beckham at Invictus Games; 4 years later, he got revenge\n\nIn the meantime, James is also open to making a financial sacrifice if the team is able to entice a veteran playmaker like James Harden or Klay Thompson or an established force to reckon with like Jonas Valanciunas to play alongside the team.\n\nWith Team USA's training camp for the Summer Paris Olympics just a week away, Paul told ESPN that the NBA's all-time scoring leader intends for this deal to be finalised before his focus drifts away to the pressing national team matters.\n\nLeBron James joined the LA Lakers in 2018, following which he won his fourth NBA title with the team in 2020. This latest report regarding the team's roster switch-up has emerged just as the player has completed his 21st season. At 39, he averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds in 71 games this season. With a career-high shooting record, he became the first player in NBA history to surpass 40,000 points.\n\nAs for James' son, Bronny went into cardiac arrest last year before kicking off his collegiate career; he was later diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. According to The Associated Press, he was eventually cleared to play in the league. In June 2024, he became the Lakers' choice at No. 55.\n\nBronny is early in his basketball development, and, so far, has had an underwhelming season at USC with 4.8 points, 36% shooting, 2.8 rebounds.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Valan\u010di\u016bnas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/30/1600x900/FILES-BASKET-NBA-DRAFT-0_1719740812622_1719740857810.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

According to James' agent, Rich Paul, via ESPN's Dave McMenamin, the NBA legend is prioritizing roster improvement in the offseason.\n\nThat means James will sit down with the Lakers and come up with a new contract that will help the team potentially land an impact player. The final year was worth $51.4 million for next season.\n\nSome speculated if James would consider leaving the Lakers, but those concerns went out the window the moment the organization selected his son, Bronny James, with the No. 55 overall pick in the 2024 NBA draft.\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement. He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster,\" Paul said, per McMenamin.\n\nThe Lakers lost in the playoffs for a second straight year to the Denver Nuggets. They avoided being swept for a consecutive season, but they did drop a 4-1 series loss in a failed effort against a Nuggets team that looked superior to them in every way.\n\nThe Western Conference isn't getting any easier with multiple young and hungry teams on the rise, including the Minnesota Timberwolves and Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nSure, the Lakers could make the playoffs, but it's hard to envision them competing for a championship without some additional firepower. James turns 40 years old in December, and Anthony Davis' health will always be a question.\n\nThere was a time when the two superstars were all that was needed to run roughshod over the rest of the NBA, but those days are long gone.\n\nStill, what James has continued to do at age 39 is nothing short of amazing. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists in 35.3 minutes per game last season.\n\nAdditional reinforcements could get the Lakers closer, if not put them over the top, for NBA title contention.\n\nRelated: LeBron James Used Two Words To Describe Bronny James' Jersey Number Choice", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordy_mcelroy@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jordy McElroy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/68/268b83c7-921f-5a7c-80c6-22aefb0d45ff/66809ce8e739a.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

There was some speculation that another team with a higher pick might swoop in and take Bronny before the Lakers, either to entice LeBron to switch teams or to simply mess with the Lakers plans.\n\nBut doing so would risk raising the ire of Rich Paul, the powerful NBA agent who represents Bronny, LeBron and many top tier players.

If James wants to stay a Laker - and he said as much at All-Star Weekend in February when asked by USA TODAY Sports - and have control over his future, opting out and re-signing with the Lakers on a three-year, $162 million deal is the best option.\n\nHe can include a no-trade clause in a new deal, which would silence any talk about the Lakers sending James to another team.\n\n\"I am a Laker, and I am happy and been very happy being a Laker the last six years, and hopefully it stays that way,\" he told USA TODAY Sports in February. \"But I don't have the answer to how long it is or which uniform I'll be in. Hopefully it is with the Lakers. It's a great organization and so many greats. But we'll see. I don't know how it's going to end (NBA playing career), but it's coming. It's coming, for sure.\"\n\nIf James wants to play elsewhere, he can get a three-year contract worth $157.5 million. Now, there aren't many teams with the kind of cap space available to sign James at the salary he wants. His agent Rich Paul, the CEO of Klutch Sports, shot down the idea of James signing a minimum contract to play for a contender. If James wants to remain on a competitive team, that narrows his options outside of the Lakers.\n\nHe averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals and shot 54% from the field and a career-high 41% on 3-pointers in 71 games in 2023-24 as he made the All-Star team for the 20th consecutive season and earned his 20th All-NBA selection.\n\nThe Lakers were eliminated from the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets for the second consecutive season - Western Conference finals last season and first round this season.\n\nJames performed well in the playoffs, scoring at least 26 points in the five games, including 30 in Game 4 and 30 points, 11 assists, nine rebounds and four steals in Game 5, and shooting better than 50% from the field. But the gap between the two teams was exposed by Denver's second-half execution and the Lakers' slim margin of error.\n\nFollow NBA reporter Jeff Zillgitt on social media @JeffZillgitt", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Weekend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ON5jz1ieKn1UfuzsIjCEyg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/e3a546c6aa0147e9fc9a600622c80055", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-30", "textStart": 558, "textEnd": 565}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

And while much of the focus will be on LeBron and Bronny playing together, the day was extremely special for Bronny just to be drafted in the first place.\n\nIt is extremely special for any player to hear their name called on draft night and to receive that call from the team selecting you. That was very much the case for Bronny and the Lakers made sure to capture the moment of Pelinka and Redick making that call to him to let him know the team would be taking him 55th overall:\n\nRegardless of whether some think James was deserving of being drafted, it can not be argued that he has put in a ton of work to get to this point. The amount of pressure on him, being the son of LeBron, is immense and unlike anything any other draft prospect had to deal with and Bronny has handled it all with a ton of grace.\n\nAs Pelinka said, Bronny's work ethic and high character stand out as things the Lakers value. But his skillset is there as well and there was a reason he was a McDonalds All-American in high school. Bronny is a great defender and excellent athlete who has a great feel for the game which shouldn't come as a surprise considering his father.\n\nBronny has put in the work and is deserving of that moment of Pelinka and Redick making that call to let him know he will be a member of the Lakers.\n\nCurrent and former NBA stars congratulate Bronny James being drafted by the Lakers\n\nThe basketball world was able to witness Bronny James being taken 55th overall by the Lakers and many took to social media to congratulate the son of LeBron James on the accomplishment.\n\nCurrent Lakers such as Austin Reaves and Jarred Vanderbilt posted on Instagram while Lakers legend Magic Johnson shared a lengthy post on X.

He confirmed that the four-time MVP had opted out of player-option, worth $51.4 million. James is willing to reduce his salary -- at least for a year -- if it means adding an impact player.\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nThe goal of James taking less is to open up the full $12.9 million mid-level exception to sign an \"impact player,\" per ESPN. Potential players that James feels match that description are James Harden, Klay Thompson or veteran big man Jonas Valanciunas.\n\nJames has made nearly $480 million on the court during his career. He also has a bevy of off-court ventures, making him one of the most successful athletes ever. James will turn 40 next season and time is running out on winning another championship. He's clearly all-in to make it happen next season.\n\nThe Lakers are on a tight timeline to make something happen. James is set to enter training camp with Team USA next week in preparation for the Olympics, and Paul wants a deal with the Lakers done by then.\n\nIf the Lakers do not land the impact player they desire by then, James will seek a maximum three-year, $162 million contract.\n\n\"If LA cannot find an impact player to sign for the full MLE that would be created by James taking a paycut, James will seek the max,\" McMenamin said. \"There can only be so much patience on James' part: Team USA camp begins a week from today in Las Vegas and he needs a deal before taking the court.\"\n\nJames averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds in 71 games last season with the Lakers. He earned his 20th All-Star nod and was named third-team All-NBA.\n\nDespite opting out, James will likely return to the Lakers. The only question now is the money. He'll have an opportunity to play alongside his son, Bronny James, whom the team selected with the No. 55 overall pick in the second round.\n\nA big part of the championship recipie in LA is Anthony Davis. The star big man has not applied any pressure on James to make a decision.\n\n\"I'm just respecting his space,\" Davis told ESPN. \"I know we'll be together all summer and I know if he decides to do something -- whether stay with the Lakers, opt in or opt out and re-sign or opt out and choose a different path, I know he'll tell me before he makes any [official] decision just because we have that relationship. So I'm pretty sure I'll know before anybody else besides, like, his family and Rich [Paul].\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Valan\u010di\u016bnas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2149468690-e1719699055216.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 231, "textEnd": 238}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

This move comes with significant strategic implications, as James is reportedly considering taking a pay cut to help the Lakers maximize their potential in free agency and the trade market.\n\nBy opting out and potentially signing a new deal at a reduced rate, LeBron could enable the Lakers to utilize the full mid-level exception (MLE), which is approximately $12.8 million. This financial flexibility could be crucial for the Lakers as they look to bolster their roster and contend for another NBA title.\n\nChris Haynes has reported that with LeBron James re-signing, he is contemplating this pay cut to open a pathway for the Lakers to secure the full mid-level exception. This would allow the team to pursue key targets in free agency more aggressively, adding depth and talent to support James and Anthony Davis.\n\nIn addition to LeBron's potential pay cut, the Lakers are also navigating the situation with D'Angelo Russell, who has opted into his contract. The Lakers are reportedly looking to trade Russell, and his $18.7 million expiring contract could be a valuable asset in trade negotiations.\n\nIf LeBron's pay cut is factored in, the Lakers would have even more financial flexibility to execute trades and sign free agents, making them a formidable player in the market.\n\nBrian Windhorst has suggested that LeBron may be willing to take a pay cut for the first time in 15 years.\n\n\"What if LeBron James for the first time in 15 years is willing to take a pay cut? That's right. It's all warm and fuzzy right now that they drafted Bronny... The Lakers could be a player in free agency, use their mid-level exception of about $12 million.\"\n\n\"So it wouldn't surprise me if LeBron waits a little bit of time, even when he's out there as a free agent intending to sign with L.A. to see what kind of contracts might be able to help the Lakers. He might be in the giving mood.\"\n\nThis move would not only demonstrate his commitment to winning but also his willingness to make personal financial sacrifices for the team's success. Windhorst noted the warm atmosphere surrounding the Lakers, especially after drafting LeBron's son, Bronny James, and hiring J.J. Redick as the new head coach. This environment might influence LeBron to take less money to facilitate better team-building opportunities.\n\nIf LeBron does take a pay cut, it would allow the Lakers to utilize the MLE to its fullest, potentially bringing in a high-caliber player who can significantly impact their playoff aspirations. Moreover, the flexibility gained from trading D'Angelo Russell could lead to acquiring another star or key role player, further strengthening the roster.\n\nLeBron James considering a pay cut to help the Lakers acquire the full mid-level exception and trade aggressively is a testament to his commitment to winning. This strategic move could position the Lakers as a major contender in free agency and the trade market, providing them with the tools needed to build a championship-caliber team around James and Davis.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles Lakers Starting Lineup And Bench After Selecting Dalton Knecht And Bronny James\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nThe move is among those coming just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals - in many situations - starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected that LeBron James would technically be a free agent. It's also been expected that he would stay with the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James - LeBron James' oldest son - on Thursday in the second round of the draft, putting them in position to have the first on-court father-son duo in NBA history. And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists last season - as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports / Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAccording to reports on Saturday, James plans to opt out of the final year of his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, then work out a new deal with the team. James was due to make $51.4 million if he exercised his player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nESPN reports the Lakers are \"committed to keeping James with the franchise\" and are willing to offer him a maximum, three-year, $162 million deal. While that is the max deal James is eligible for, the two sides could come to another agreement once they begin negotiating.\n\nJames just finished his sixth season with the Lakers and has maintained an incredible level of play as he has aged. He was named third team All-NBA during the 2023-24 campaign while averaging 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists in 35.2 minutes per game. He also shot a career-best 41% from three-point range and made 54% of his shots from the field.\n\nOn Friday, the Lakers deepened James's connection to the franchise by selecting his son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nLos Angeles is fully built around James at this point, so it's not shocking the two sides would like to continue their partnership. The Lakers hired his podcast co-host JJ Redick as their new head coach a few days before selecting Bronny in the draft.\n\nThe all-time great appears ready to end his career with the Lakers. The partnership has been successful, as James led the franchise to an NBA title in '20.

According to ESPN, James opted out of a contract worth $51.4 million for next season to become a free agent eligible to sign a maximum three-year deal with the Lakers worth $162 million.\n\nBut ESPN, which sourced James' agent Rich Paul, said the NBA's all-time leading scorer is willing to work with the Lakers on a deal below the maximum to better position the team to sign an impact player. \"He is prioritizing a roster improvement,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nJames had until 5 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) on Saturday to decide whether to opt into his player option for the 2024-25 National Basketball Association season. Reuters was unable to reach Paul for comment while the Lakers did not immediately respond when asked to confirm the ESPN report.\n\nIn six seasons with the Lakers the four-times league MVP has averaged 27 points per game, eight assists and 7.9 rebounds. The Lakers finished seventh in the Western Conference this year with a 47-35 record and went on to lose to the defending champion Denver Nuggets in the first round of the NBA playoffs.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/16_01_2019_13_05_02_5451348.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nThe move is among those coming just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected that LeBron James would technically be a free agent. It's also been expected that he would stay with the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James -- LeBron James' oldest son -- on Thursday in the second round of the draft, putting them in position to have the first on-court father-son duo in NBA history. And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists last season -- as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Mandatory Credit: Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLeBron James opted out of his Los Angeles Lakers contract, as expected, but there is little doubt that he will ultimately re-sign with the team. The terms of that next contract may be dictated, however, by what the Lakers can pull off in free agency.\n\nJames and his agent Rich Paul have made clear to the Lakers that he is open to taking less than the max if it means the team can afford another impact player, according to Dave McMenamin of ESPN. By taking less money, James could allow the Lakers to open up the full mid-level exception of $12.9 million.\n\nJames would want the Lakers to pursue a playmaker such as Klay Thompson or James Harden with the MLE. He would also be open to an established big man such as Jonas Valanciunas. According to Paul, James will ask for the max if the Lakers cannot add a player like that.\n\nThe Lakers could certainly be helped by James' flexibility. A pursuit of Thompson, for instance, seems more realistic than ever, though it remains to be seen if the MLE would be enough to get him to sign there.

LeBron James is reportedly willing to take a significant pay cut to help the team achieve this goal. According to NBA insiders, James plans to opt out of his current contract and sign a new deal that would reduce his salary by approximately $17 million. This move is intended to free up a full mid-level exception contract, enabling the Lakers to sign a valuable starter or bench contributor, although not a star player.\n\nLeBron's willingness to reduce his salary demonstrates his commitment to strengthening the team's roster. Among the potential targets for the Lakers are Klay Thompson, who is expected to leave the Golden State Warriors, as well as Miles Bridges, Jonas Valanciunas, and Caleb Martin.\n\nJames' decision comes as part of a broader strategy to enhance the Lakers' competitiveness and potentially bring another championship to Los Angeles. The Lakers are navigating the salary cap to ensure they can add the necessary talent to complement their recent draft picks, Dalton Knecht and Bronny James.\n\nThe Lakers' management is reportedly eager for LeBron to retire with the team, and drafting Bronny could be a key part of that plan.

Paul George and Klay Thompson may simply be on the move to new teams.\n\nAnd the NBA's free agency period, which officially starts Sunday, suddenly has some intrigue.\n\nJames did not exercise his option to accept what would have been a $51.4 million contract for this coming season and instead is seeking a new deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, a person with knowledge of the decision said Saturday.\n\nThe terms of the new deal could be finalized quickly, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither James nor the Lakers revealed the decision publicly. ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, George made a similar decision, the nine-time All-Star choosing to not opt-in for what would have been a $48.8 million contract this coming season with the Los Angeles Clippers -- a team that he's spent the past five years with, averaging 23 points per game. He'll become a free agent and is planning to talk to the Clippers about a new deal and also intends to hear pitches from Orlando and Philadelphia, plus potentially others, a person briefed on George's plans told AP on Saturday night.\n\nSaturday's moves came just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected that James would technically be a free agent.

And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement,\" James' agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, told ESPN on Saturday. \"He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists last season -- as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nAnd if he's going to leave money on the table, he's going to want a player who can help the Lakers contend for a title again. Among the Lakers' potential targets: Golden State's Klay Thompson, a free agent who could be on the move for the first time in his career.\n\nThompson, a starter on all four of the Warriors' championship teams of this era and half of the famed \"Splash Brothers\" duo alongside 3-point king Stephen Curry, has spent all 13 of his NBA years with Golden State. And his status -- will he go back to the Warriors or not? -- is one of the biggest questions that'll be answered in the coming days. It may not be financially possible for Golden State to retain Thompson.\n\n\"We want him back. We've said that all along,\" Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy said on June 24. \"Hopefully he'll come back. But as far as the specifics and discussions and those types of things, I think it's important to keep in-house and that stuff.

It's expected he'll re-sign with the Los Angeles Lakers. However, Rich Paul, James' agent, reveals that James has one \"priority\" for the franchise to fulfill before he signs a deal.\n\nReports indicate that LeBron James will sign a new contract with the Lakers as long as the front office acquires \"an impact player\" this offseason, according to Dave McMenamin of ESPN. To put it simply, James wants to ensure the roster is up to standards before he signs a new deal.\n\n\"Rich Paul of Klutch Sports told ESPN that LeBron James has officially opted out with L.A. and will work with LAL on his next deal if it means adding an impact player: 'He is prioritizing a roster improvement. He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.'\"\n\nThe Lakers are on a rather short timetable to see this through. LeBron James is preparing for the Summer Olympics and it sounds like the superstar forward \"needs a deal before taking the court.\" McMenamin also reports that if the Lakers are unable to acquire an impact player, then James will demand a full max deal. So, there's a chance LA signs James on a cheaper contract while also picking up a solid player through free agency or trade.\n\n\"If LA cannot find an impact player to sign for the full MLE that would be created by James taking a pay cut, James will seek the max. There can only be so much patience on James' part: Team USA camp begins a week from today in Las Vegas and he needs a deal before taking the court.\"\n\nSo, when it comes down to it, LeBron James is likely to sign a contract with the Lakers no matter what. But the front office has an opportunity to bring in a star-caliber player to improve the roster and still retain James for at least next season. We'll see how it plays out, but the front office must act swiftly.\n\nWho should the Lakers target to please LeBron James?\n\nThere are plenty of options on the table for the Lakers right now. The easiest path to finding another star is through free agency. But we can't rule out a possible trade either. Finding a stud free agent would be the best decision, as the front office wouldn't have to give up any assets like they would in a trade.\n\nWith that said, reports point to three names that LeBron James would be willing to take a pay cut for. Those players are James Harden, Klay Thompson, or Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas, per Dave McMenamin of ESPN.\n\n\"The type of player that James would be willing to make a financial sacrifice for would be an established veteran playmaker like James Harden or Klay Thompson, or an established big man to play alongside Anthony Davis -- like Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas, sources told ESPN.\"\n\nWe should expect the Lakers to pursue Harden, Thompson, and/or Valan\u010di\u016bnas in the coming days.

This willingness to reduce his salary showcases James's commitment to building a championship-caliber team around him, even at this stage of his illustrious career.\n\n\"In order for LeBron James to sacrifice enough money to get the Lakers receiving the full midlevel exception, he will have to take $16 million less next season. And that's a lot of money.\"\n\n\"For someone who is 39 years old, that's a lot of money to be given up in a season. But it would take that much to get the Lakers the full midlevel exception.\"\n\n\"If LeBron were to do this, it's not a situation that you gonna use that to bring on a couple of players to try to improve the team by the margins. No.\"\n\n\"It will take a star-level or a borderline star player to accept that midlevel exception, which would be a pay cut for that player. That's what it will take for LeBron to take a pay cut.\"\n\nChris Haynes reported that James's agent, Rich Paul, indicated the pay cut would only happen if it allows the Lakers to acquire an \"impact player.\" The names mentioned include Klay Thompson and James Harden, both of whom would fit the bill but would also require significant pay cuts themselves to join the Lakers under these financial constraints.\n\nJames opted out of his contract with the Lakers, which would have paid him $51.4 million next season. By doing so, he opens the possibility of re-signing at a lower salary, potentially around $33 million for the 2024-25 season.\n\nThis significant pay cut would enable the Lakers to utilize the full non-taxpayer midlevel exception, worth approximately $12.9 million, to sign a high-impact player or a star who could be a game-changer for the team.\n\nJames's decision to take a pay cut is not just about the money; it is about securing the right pieces to make the Lakers a formidable contender. The Lakers have already made strategic moves this offseason, including hiring JJ Redick as head coach, drafting Dalton Knecht, and uniting LeBron with his son, Bronny James, by selecting him with the 55th pick in the NBA Draft.\n\nD'Angelo Russell's decision to opt into his contract provides the Lakers with a valuable trade asset, further enhancing their flexibility in building the roster.\n\nLeBron's potential pay cut is also about setting the right tone and showing his commitment to winning another championship. Despite his age, LeBron remains one of the top talents in the NBA and is driven to secure another title. His willingness to sacrifice financially to improve the team's chances highlights his dedication to the Lakers and his pursuit of greatness.\n\nThis move would not only help the Lakers financially but also potentially bring in the necessary talent to make a deep playoff run. With James willing to take a pay cut, the Lakers are better positioned to pursue and acquire the right pieces to build a championship team, showing that LeBron is not just playing for personal accolades but for the legacy of the franchise.\n\nLeBron James Wants To Have One Last Title Run\n\nLeBron James, one of the greatest players in NBA history, is signaling his desire for one last title run by considering a significant pay cut. This move is driven by his determination to build a competitive squad capable of contending for the championship in his final seasons.\n\nLeBron's commitment to the Lakers is evident in his willingness to sacrifice financially to enhance the team's roster. This decision comes at a pivotal moment in his career as he approaches the twilight of his playing days.\n\nDrafting his son, Bronny James, and the prospect of playing alongside him is a dream come true for LeBron. Not only will it create a unique and historic father-son duo on the court, but it also presents an opportunity for LeBron to achieve another rare feat: winning a championship with his son by his side.\n\nThe Lakers fell short last season, making it to the Western Conference Finals but getting swept by the Denver Nuggets. LeBron understands the challenges ahead, especially in a highly competitive Western Conference.\n\nTeams are continually improving, and the road to a championship is fraught with obstacles. To have a realistic shot at the title, the Lakers need a well-rounded, strong squad that can compete at the highest level.\n\nLeBron's willingness to take a pay cut is a strategic move to allow the Lakers to utilize the full non-taxpayer midlevel exception, thereby enabling them to acquire key players who can make a significant impact. This financial flexibility can help the Lakers target high-caliber talent to bolster their roster.\n\nLeBron's legacy is already cemented with four championships, but his hunger for more success drives him to strive for one last title. This potential final championship run is not just about adding another ring to his collection; it's about securing his legacy, playing alongside his son, and providing the Lakers with another opportunity to achieve greatness.\n\nBy making personal sacrifices and focusing on team-building, LeBron is setting the stage for a memorable and potentially historic final chapter in his illustrious career. The Lakers' front office must now capitalize on this opportunity, assembling a roster that can help LeBron achieve his ultimate goal: one last championship run.\n\nRelated: Klay Thompson Is 'Intrigued' About Playing With LeBron James And The Lakers\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

They have barely even tried to hide this.\n\nWhen they attempted a big swing at landing Connecticut coach Dan Hurley, the thought process was landing one of the best developmental coaches in basketball to work with Bronny James.\n\nAfter the Lakers whiffed at Hurley, they settled for LeBron's close friend, business partner and podcast co-host, JJ Redick, as their next head coach.\n\nEven after that, Rich Paul ensured that Bronny would wind up in Los Angeles after reportedly telling opposing teams not to draft the 19-year-old because he'd go play in Australia.\n\nSo, the stage is set for the greatest player of this generation to return to the Lakers and ride off into the sunset, right? Well, it seems like it. But he will be an unrestricted free agent, free to meet and discuss a new contract with other teams.\n\nAfter drafting his son and hiring his friend as head coach, James has to return to the Lakers. But it would be so funny if he didn't.\n\nThe Western Conference is very tough. James knows this. According to reports, both James and fellow Lakers star Anthony Davis have put pressure on the organization to find a third superstar.\n\nLeBron will be 40 years old in December. With four championships under his belt, he still needs two more to tie Michael Jordan's six rings. Pulling that off in a Lakers uniform will be very hard. Perhaps LeBron could look to the Eastern Conference for an easier path back to the NBA Finals.\n\nLet's be real for a second, though. There's almost no way he's leaving the Lakers.\n\nMaybe the bottom falls out in these next few weeks and he opts to play elsewhere. As a free agent, that's always a possibility. But according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin, James is willing to be flexible with this next contract to secure another star.\n\nIf anything, this could be his last NBA contract to retire in the purple and gold. Remember, Los Angeles loosely contemplated trading James at last season's deadline. Perhaps he makes one more demand this offseason: a no-trade clause.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_pedone@deadspin.com", "name": "Nick Pedone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadspin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadspin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://lineup-publishing.s3.amazonaws.com/1719696746107", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Paul George and Klay Thompson may simply be on the move to new teams.\n\nAnd the NBA's free agency period, which officially starts Sunday, suddenly has some intrigue.\n\nJames did not exercise his option to accept what would have been a $51.4 million contract for this coming season and instead is seeking a new deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, a person with knowledge of the decision said Saturday.\n\nThe terms of the new deal could be finalized quickly, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither James nor the Lakers revealed the decision publicly. ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, George made a similar decision, the nine-time All-Star choosing to not opt-in for what would have been a $48.8 million contract this coming season with the Los Angeles Clippers -- a team that he's spent the past five years with, averaging 23 points per game. He'll become a free agent and is planning to talk to the Clippers about a new deal and also intends to hear pitches from Orlando and Philadelphia, plus potentially others, a person briefed on George's plans told AP on Saturday night.\n\nSaturday's moves came just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected that James would technically be a free agent. It's also been expected that he would stay with the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James -- LeBron James' oldest son -- on Thursday in the second round of the draft, putting them in position to have the first on-court father-son duo in NBA history. And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement,\" James' agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, told ESPN on Saturday. \"He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists last season -- as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nAnd if he's going to leave money on the table, he's going to want a player who can help the Lakers contend for a title again. Among the Lakers' potential targets: Golden State's Klay Thompson, a free agent who could be on the move for the first time in his career.\n\nThompson, a starter on all four of the Warriors' championship teams of this era and half of the famed \"Splash Brothers\" duo alongside 3-point king Stephen Curry, has spent all 13 of his NBA years with Golden State. And his status -- will he go back to the Warriors or not? -- is one of the biggest questions that'll be answered in the coming days. It may not be financially possible for Golden State to retain Thompson.\n\n\"We want him back. We've said that all along,\" Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy said on June 24. \"Hopefully he'll come back. But as far as the specifics and discussions and those types of things, I think it's important to keep in-house and that stuff. When we figure out a solution to all that, we'll have news for you.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@businessmirror.com.ph", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

George joked about what Bronny will call his dad when they're on the same team, before looking forward to watching Bronny throw a lob for LeBron to alley-oop.\n\n\"I don't know how soon JJ Redick is going to throw Bronny out there. But it'll be cool to see. Just imagine, that Bronny throws a lob to LeBron. LA is going to go crazy... It's just the dynamic of that. Bronny (is) going to be on a little fast break, Bron is trying to chase it down.\"\n\nGeorge added that he is very excited to see Bronny in the NBA, and claimed that he has high potential in the NBA to be a success. George is clearly a believer in the potential of Bronny James.\n\n\"I think so. I'm a fan of Bronny. I think he has NBA potential for sure.\"\n\nBronny James was selected by the Lakers with the 55th overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. The Lakers are excited by both the player and the person James proved himself to be, as Lakers GM Rob Pelinka said in the press conference after the second round of the draft.\n\nThe Lakers will probably be sending Bronny to the G League to develop, as he is still quite a raw prospect who needs to develop before he plays regular NBA minutes. But we are very likely to see at least one game where LeBron James and Bronny James are on the court together at the same time.\n\nMany NBA Players Think Highly Of Bronny James\n\nGeorge is far from the only player looking forward to watching Bronny James in the NBA. Recently, Draymond Green recently spoke on his podcast and noted that Bronny will be a success in the NBA because of his genetics, and added that being the son of LeBron James has given him some great physical gifts but also a solid basketball IQ.\n\n\"We all know what Bronny went through a year ago. To go through that and make it back from that and be in the NBA within a year, is a testament to his drive and work ethic.\"\n\n\"I think Bronny is going to end up being a better pro than a lot of these players in the 2024 draft because he has the athleticism, has the basketball IQ, plays the game the right way. I think he's going to be a good shooter in the NBA. I'm just going to take the bet that this kid works hard, which he does, and he's got LeBron James' DNA. And then you watch him play, and he's a good basketball player.\"\n\nBronny will always have known about the struggles he would have if he ever made it to the NBA. With his father being one of the greatest players of all time, there was never going to be a situation where Bronny wasn't compared to him. But he should focus on his own game and development, and try to be his own player.\n\nLakers fans will get their first glimpse at Bronnyn James next month, as the NBA Summer League takes place in Las Vegas. James will be looking to impress JJ Redick and the rest of the Lakers staff ahead of the next season to earn some minutes with the team next season.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

They landed top-10 prospect Dalton Knecht with the No. 17 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. They made history by uniting LeBron James with his eldest son, Bronny James, with their No. 55 selection. D'Angelo Russell, possibly the biggest domino of their offseason, opted in, giving them a mid-sized expiring contract to potentially trade.\n\nThen, on Saturday morning, nearly five hours ahead of a 5 p.m. ET deadline, LeBron James opted out of his contract with the intention of re-signing with the Lakers, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania. The Athletic previously reported the Lakers want James to return and were open to offering him whatever type of contract he prefers.\n\nJames opting out is another win for the Lakers, as James opting out instead of exercising his $51.4 million player option for next season could save the Lakers at least $1.5 million on their cap sheet. (The trade-off for James is he's eligible to add a no-trade clause to his contract, which would allow him to control his future.)\n\nJames may be willing to take an even steeper pay cut on top of that if it allows the Lakers to open up the non-taxpayer mid-level exception (worth approximately $12.9 million) for the right types of players, according to Bleacher Report. James' agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, told ESPN his client would only be willing to take a discount for an \"impact player,\" with James Harden, Klay Thompson and Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas as reported names who'd fit the bill. The nontaxpayer midlevel exception would be a significant pay cut for Harden and Thompson, in particular.\n\nHowever, there is mutual interest between the Lakers and Thompson, as The Athletic's Shams Charania and Anthony Slater first reported. Thompson, a Southern California native, is the son of Mychal Thompson, who played for the Showtime Lakers from 1987 through 1991 and is the team's current radio color commentator. The younger Thompson, 34, is a four-time NBA champion and one of the greatest shooters of all time -- arguably the second-best behind only his current teammate, Stephen Curry. Thompson has spent his 12 pro seasons with the Golden State Warriors, but the relationship has fractured to the point where Thompson is likely to leave. The Lakers, Dallas Mavericks and LA Clippers are all pursuing him.\n\nIf James takes a discount for the Lakers to access their full nontaxpayer midlevel exception, the Lakers will be hard-capped at the first apron of $178.7 million. That means James would have to take a $16-plus million discount, with his starting salary at about just over $33 million for the 2024-25 season. The most likely pay cut scenario would be James signing a two-year deal with a player option for 2025-26, allowing him to opt out in 2025 and re-sign for more money, according to league sources. The Lakers could also perform a smaller salary-dump trade (or two) to create more financial wiggle room and allow James to take a smaller decrease.\n\nIf the Lakers don't land a star or high-level starter with their nontaxpayer midlevel exception, James will sign the max, according to ESPN. If LeBron re-signs at his max for 2024-25 (approximately $49.9 million), the Lakers will have roughly $182.3 million in committed salary. That puts them less than $8 million under the second apron ($189.5 million). James also wants to have his contract resolved before he starts practicing at the U.S. men's Olympic basketball minicamp on July 6 in Las Vegas.\n\nRegardless of what happens with James and the Lakers' exceptions, though, the Lakers are well-positioned to upgrade their roster if they so choose. The proverbial ball is in their court regarding how the rest of this offseason unfolds.\n\nLakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka tempered expectations earlier in the week -- twice -- by saying trades are harder to execute under the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement. At face value, that's true, considering the new punitive restrictions of the first and second aprons.\n\nAt the same time, the trade activity over the past week, especially near the top of the Western Conference, paints a different reality. In that time, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded for defensive ace Alex Caruso, the Minnesota Timberwolves traded for No. 8 pick Rob Dillingham, the Denver Nuggets traded up for DaRon Holmes II and salary-dumped Reggie Jackson to try to retain Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, the Dallas Mavericks salary-dumped Tim Hardaway Jr. so they can keep starter Derrick Jones Jr. (or sign Thompson) and the New Orleans Pelicans made a shrewd deal for former Lakers target Dejounte Murray.\n\nThe rest of the West is finding ways to make trades that improve their rosters or act as precursors to other moves. It's now on the Lakers to do the same.\n\nThey have the assets to make a notable trade. Russell's $18.7 million contract offers them a level of flexibility in terms of the types of players they can pursue. Add in one or both of their future first-round picks, as many as three pick swaps and the mid-sized salaries of Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt and/or Gabe Vincent, and the Lakers can get in the conversation for just about any non-star (and even some lower-end stars). That is, again, before factoring in the potential addition of Thompson or another high-impact player for their nontaxpayer midlevel exception.\n\nAs far as trades go, the Lakers landing a third star in a deal appears unlikely, barring an unforeseen one secretly becoming available. Donovan Mitchell is reportedly likely to sign a contract extension with Cleveland, which would rule him out for the time being. Trae Young's switch from Klutch Sports to CAA also makes a trade to the Lakers less likely, as The Athletic previously reported. Murray is now in New Orleans and off the board. Perhaps Darius Garland becomes available, but he's a clear step down from the Mitchell and Young tier of stars.\n\nStill, there are good options potentially out there. Wings like Portland's Jerami Grant, former Laker Kyle Kuzma and the Nets' duo of Dorian Finney-Smith and Cam Johnson are expected to be available on the trade market, according to league sources. They aren't the biggest needle-movers, but any of those four players would enhance the Lakers' perimeter defense, frontcourt size and/or floor spacing. Grant, for his part, would check each of those boxes; he's quietly shot 40-plus percent on 3s in back-to-back seasons in Portland.\n\nThe Lakers roster, as currently constructed, is simply not good enough to come out of the Western Conference. They can win a round and maybe even two if the bracket breaks in their favor, but they have too many holes compared to the rest of the top of the West, especially on the wing. Their perimeter size, defense and overall speed and athleticism are lacking compared to their competition. James and Davis made it known recently they believe this roster needs upgrades.\n\nThe Timberwolves, Thunder, Mavericks and Pelicans all have better rosters than the ones they finished last season. Denver's standing could change if it loses Caldwell-Pope in free agency and the Clippers will likely fall off if they lose Paul George, but the larger point is the rest of the West is revamping, potentially creating even more distance between them and the Lakers. If the Lakers are as serious about competing for championships with James and Davis as they claim to be, they must bolster this supporting cast.\n\nThe most immediate complication to this effort is the roster crunch the Lakers are facing. Assuming LeBron James re-signs, they will have 14 players under contract after Russell, Christian Wood, Jaxson Hayes and Cam Reddish opted in and they drafted Knecht and Bronny James. That's before factoring in their other free agents (Max Christie, Taurean Prince and Spencer Dinwiddie) or any prospective free agents.\n\nThe Lakers tendered a qualifying offer to Christie to officially make him a restricted free agent, team sources confirmed to The Athletic. The front office would like to retain Christie and envision him as a rotation player next season, according to those sources. However, the Lakers would need to clear additional money and a roster spot to sign both Christie and another player with the nontaxpayer midlevel exception.\n\nHad Russell opted out, the Lakers would have had less optionality on the trade market. But with him opting in, James interested in taking a pay cut for the right free agent and the Lakers armed with multiple mid-sized salaries, two first-round picks and multiple pick swaps to trade, there is no excuse for Los Angeles to not dramatically improve its roster with a big move or two over the next few days.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

All of that has been made possible because of the LA Lakers. The franchise drafted Bronny as their 55th pick, uniting the father and son, and this soon became the talk of the town. Like many others, the Clippers' ace Paul George brought up his topic on his \"Podcast P\" showering the young guard with praise.\n\nPredicting the impact the duo will have on the fans, PG-13 said, \"Just imagine Bronny [James] throws a lob to LeBron [James], LA is gonna go crazy... I'm a fan of Bronny I think he has NBA potential.\" George believes that the 19-year-old possesses the abilities required to ace in the league. He also feels that the pair will set the court on fire with their masterclass performance.\n\nLeBron and Bronny have already etched their names on the NBA books as the only father-son duo to be playing at the same time. The 39-year-old, who has expressed his desire to play alongside his offspring, can do so if he decides to stay with the franchise. Many believe this was the masterstroke of the Lakers that made LBJ stay back. However, the real reason has been disclosed.\n\nNumerous rumors have been circulated about Bronny James' drafting. One of them concerns the Lakers' motive to keep LeBron with them. But the Lakers' GM, Rob Pelinka, spilled the truth.\n\nRevealing the actual reason behind Bronny's draft, Pelinka stated in a press conference, \"He's worked for everything that he's gotten, including being selected today at No. 55.\" Hoping that LeBron will stay and the two will appear on the hardwood together, he further added, \"Next season NBA history ... should be made in a Lakers uniform.\"\n\nThe Lakers are undergoing a drastic change to come back on track.

The problems, though, are multiple.\n\nOne, can the Lakers acquire an important enough addition with the midlevel exception, which begins at $13 million per season? Two, can they offload salary with their limited draft capital?

The Lakers are willing to offer James a max three-year, $162 million contract with a full no-trade clause. If he signed that deal though then the Lakers would have a full roster and would be right at the second tax apron, which means they wouldn't be able to use their mid-level exception in free agency.\n\nJames and Anthony Davis have both been clear about wanting to improve the roster though, and reports have indicated that LeBron is even willing to take less money to do so.\n\nAfter officially opting out, James' agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports confirmed that he would be willing to take less money, but only if it helps the Lakers land an impact player, per Dave McMenamin of ESPN:\n\nIf James were to take a pay cut for the Lakers to access their full mid-level exception worth $12.9 million, it would be for around $19 million a year. That would put him at about $31 million per season, a significant decrease from his max.\n\nBut if the Lakers are able to unload some contracts by sending out more money than they receive in a trade, then James' discount would lessen from the $19 million. These are likely the different avenues that Pelinka is exploring heading into free agency on Sunday.\n\nIf he is unable to make it work though, then it looks like James will be content taking his full max, as he should. He is doing what he can to help the Lakers improve, and now it is up to the front office to make it happen.\n\nThe other free agent decision the Lakers need to make is Max Christie, who is a restricted free agent after the team tendered him a qualifying offer.\n\nHow much Christie gets in his new deal will also impact how big of a discount James needs to take for L.A.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_starkand@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Daniel Starkand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaxson_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaxson Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Reddish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cam Reddish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Angelo_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D'Angelo Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Christie_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Christie (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/LeBron-James-43.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

While there is plenty of focus on whether James will become a free agent for the fourth time in his decorated career, his Lakers future is hardly in doubt given they selected his son in the second round of the NBA draft on Thursday.\n\nThe Athletic, ESPN and CBS Sports said James will opt out of his $51.4 million player option for next season, which would make him a free agent and eligible to sign a maximum three-year deal with the Lakers worth around $160 million. Such a deal would include a no-trade clause, meaning the 39-year-old James would presumably retire as a member of the Lakers or control his next destination.\n\nJames has until 5 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) on Saturday to decide whether to opt into his player option for the 2024-25 National Basketball Association season. If James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, opts into his contract for next season and signs an extension in August he would not be eligible for a no-trade clause.\n\nIn six seasons with the Lakers, the four-times league MVP has averaged 27 points per game, eight assists and 7.9 rebounds.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/08_02_2023_10_55_24_4504976.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Reportedly, the Lakers were ready to adorn his legacy with a three-year max deal.\n\nHarden, Thompson, and Valanciunas are all unrestricted free agents.

If LeBron Sr. picks up his $51.4 million player option for next season this week, he would guarantee he'll get to take his son to work in the fall.\n\nPelinka was careful not to get ahead of himself while triumphantly discussing Bronny's potential, but the GM acknowledged that a father-son pairing in purple and gold was \"something that could be magical.\"\n\n\"We know and have to respect, of course, that LeBron has a decision about his opt-out,\" Pelinka said.\n\n\"I'm sure he and his family and his agent will deliberate what they're going to do there, and he has freedom to decide whatever is best for him and his family. But if it worked out that he was on our team next season, NBA history could be made, and NBA history should be make in a Lakers uniform.\"\n\nWith their two major moves this week, the Lakers have made it clear they're determined to stick with James as their centerpiece and leader through his record-tying 22nd NBA season this fall and beyond.\n\nLos Angeles' new coach is JJ Redick, who hosted the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with James this year. Redick is a 15-year NBA veteran who has never coached an adult basketball game, yet the Lakers quickly made the unusual choice of hiring the broadcaster after Dan Hurley turned them down -- and Pelinka didn't deny that Redick's compatibility with James was a plus.\n\nThe Lakers then used the 55th overall pick on Bronny, who put up modest statistics in his only year of college at Southern California. Bronny James is undeniably talented, but an identical player with a different name would have been less likely to be drafted.\n\nPelinka and the Lakers scouted Bronny James extensively, and he performed solidly at the pre-draft camp and again in a workout at the Lakers' training complex, which was followed by a meeting with Pelinka. Pelinka said he never even asked Bronny what he thought about the potential pressure of playing alongside his father -- something that even LeBron has said Bronny wasn't necessarily eager to do. \"We really kept the draft process to Bronny being a Laker, and what we felt like we needed to do to help him become great,\" Pelinka said. \"We didn't talk a lot about that, just because (we) wanted to respect his dad's decision as a free agent, so that wasn't really something that came up.\"\n\nThat decision feels ever more like a formality now, depending on how James decides to do it. The 20time All-Star and four-time NBA champion has spoken repeatedly over the years of his desire to play a season with his son, and now the dream is a signature away from reality.\n\nJames could pick up his option for 2024-25, or he could sign a new extension for even more money. He could get a maximum three year, $162 million deal that would give him the longest career in NBA history if he played out the contract.\n\nEither option would likely be just fine with Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who showed a similarly passionate loyalty to Kobe Bryant when she pushed to give him a $48.5 million extension for the final two seasons of his career despite his growing injury problems.\n\nBronny likely doesn't the get Lakers closer to winning now, but their choice with the 17th overall pick just might: Dalton Knecht, the high-scoring Tennessee wing who won the SEC Player of the Year award, appears to be one of the most pro-ready players in the draft, and not just because he's already 23 years old.\n\n\"In my mind, I thought there's no way a player that skilled would be available to us (at No. 17),\" Pelinka said. Pelinka has repeatedly tried to keep fan expectations low for a major player addition to a team that lost to Denver in the first round of the postseason, instead targeting incremental improvements to the core around James and Anthony Davis -- along with a potential upgrade on the bench from Redick's innovative basketball mind.\n\n\"We've explored every upgrade we could to make our team better,\" Pelinka said. \"Trades in general have just because more difficult because of the new CBA system, and so there's less access to making those big moves than maybe there was under the old system. But it didn't keep us from trying to look at everything, and ways to put ourselves in a position to be better.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nLeBron James has opted out of his deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, his agent, Rich Paul, told ESPN.\n\nThe decision, although expected, comes two days after the team selected his son, Bronny, with the 55th pick in the NBA Draft.\n\nIt is widely expected the NBA's all-time leading scorer will remain with the Lakers, though, and he could very well take a pay cut from the nearly $52 million he was set to make this season.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement. He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster,\" Paul told the network.\n\nJames joined the Lakers in 2018 after a return to the Cavaliers, where he finally gave the city of Cleveland a championship. He won his fourth NBA title with the Lakers in 2020.\n\nHe just finished his 21st season and played in his record 20th All-Star Game.\n\nAt age 39, he averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds per game, all numbers comparable to his career stats of 27.1, 7.4 and 7.5. He also set a career-high by shooting 41.7% from 3-point range, while becoming the first player to score over 40,000 points in a career.\n\nAmong players who have played more than 100 games at age 35 and older, James' 27.2 points per game are the most ever by a decent margin. Second is Michael Jordan, who averaged 22.5 in 171 games after turning 35. James has played in 262 since his 35th birthday.\n\nBRYCE JAMES THROWS COLD WATER ON PROSPECT OF PLAYING IN THE NBA WITH HIS DAD, LEBRON JAMES: 'HE'S GONNA BE 42'\n\nThe Lakers' selection of Bronny made LeBron and Bronny the first father-son duo to be active players in the NBA at the same time.\n\nBefore his collegiate career began, Bronny went into cardiac arrest in July 2023 while working out at USC. It was later revealed he had a congenital heart defect. He was cleared to return, and The Associated Press recently reported he was medically cleared to play in the NBA.\n\nLeBron once said his final year in the NBA would be with his son, so some have assumed in recent years that James would retire after playing with his son for one year. But last week, Paul said the two were not a package deal.\n\nPaul said LeBron was \"off\" the \"idea\" of playing alongside his son and was more focused on Bronny's development in the league.\n\nIt seemed peculiar, though, that Bronny had invites for workouts with at least 10 teams but only accepted two from the Lakers and Phoenix Suns. However, Paul says that was all \"by design.\"\n\nScouts weren't too kind to Bronny, with one saying he was \"not an NBA prospect.\" In his lone season with the USC Trojans, he averaged less than five points per game.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOnce he begins the 2024-25 campaign, LeBron will make history in two ways.

It seems hard to think that Bronny will crack the Lakers' rotation right away. He might have a cup of coffee and join LeBron James for a few Laker games, just to get his feet wet and have the kinds of experiences he and his father want to remember for the rest of their lives, but over the larger course of the coming basketball season, it seems highly likely that Bronny will be developing his game in the G League.\n\nThe NBA Today crew featuring Kendrick Perkins, Dave McMenamin and Brian Windhorst joins Malika Andrews to discuss Bronny James' future with the Los Angeles Lakers.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malika_Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malika Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Windhorst", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Windhorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1w1jtWOefh95dAoxosE6Lg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04Mzg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/trojans_wire_usa_today_articles_495/36bb6468c38c083634e1b2e26b20e674", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

He'll become a free agent and is planning to talk to the Clippers about a new deal and also intends to hear pitches from Orlando and Philadelphia, plus potentially others, a person briefed on George's plans told the AP on Saturday night.\n\nSaturday's moves came just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nIt was expected that James would technically be a free agent. It's also been expected that he would stay with the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James -- LeBron James' oldest son -- on Thursday in the second round of the draft, putting them in position to have the first on-court father-son duo in NBA history. And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\n\"He is prioritizing a roster improvement,\" James' agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, told ESPN on Saturday. \"He's been adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.3 assists last season -- as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nAnd if he's going to leave money on the table, he's going to want a player who can help the Lakers contend for a title again. Among the Lakers' potential targets: Golden State's Thompson, a free agent who could be on the move for the first time in his career.\n\nThompson, a starter on all four of the Warriors' championship teams of this era and half of the famed \"Splash Brothers\" duo alongside 3-point king Stephen Curry, has spent all 13 of his NBA years with Golden State. And his status -- will he go back to the Warriors or not? -- is one of the biggest questions that'll be answered in the coming days. It may not be financially possible for Golden State to retain Thompson.\n\n\"We want him back. We've said that all along,\" Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy said on June 24. \"Hopefully he'll come back. But as far as the specifics and discussions and those types of things, I think it's important to keep in-house and that stuff.

The question now, however, is how much will it take to bring him back?\n\nAccording to recent reports, James is willing to take a paycut from the maximum three-year, $162 million deal he could get. But there's one caveat: the Lakers must first add an impactful player that could help them contend for a championship.\n\nIf LA is unable to make a significant roster addition, then James will reportedly seek the max contract, per Dave McMenamin of ESPN.\n\nInterestingly, McMenamin revealed at least three players that James would be willing to take a paycut for, which includes Klay Thompson, James Harden and Jonas Valanciunas.\n\n\"The type of player that James would be willing to make a financial sacrifice for would be an established veteran playmaker like James Harden or Klay Thompson, or an established big man to play alongside Anthony Davis -- like Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas, sources told ESPN,\" McMenamin wrote.\n\nThompson, Harden and Valanciunas are all set to be free agents this offseason, and considering the latest report, it's safe to assume that the Lakers would be focusing on these three first once free agency opens on Sunday.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Lakers will actually be able to sign any of those three players mentioned. But sure enough, James' willingness to sacrifice a significant amount of money is a huge boost in their free agency plans.\n\nRelated: Stephen Curry Reacts To Bronny James Teaming Up With LeBron James On Lakers", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelo_guinhawa@postandcourier.com", "name": "Angelo Guinhawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Farm_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State Farm Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Valan\u010di\u016bnas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/5a/25a78ae4-855a-5f2f-8d93-6d59ea8f9e05/66809ce846686.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C84&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-15", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

In fact, his stacked list of accolades should speak for itself. But with the free-agency period getting ready to open, it's safe to say NBA fans are keeping tabs on what James' next move will be with his potential impending free agency.\n\nWith James declining his $51 million player option with the Los Angeles Lakers, he could soon be a free agent available to all bidders. However, after the Lakers drafted LeBron James' son, Bronny, the Lakers reportedly will be looking to quickly sign LeBron James to a new deal.\n\nStill, that doesn't prevent other teams from dreaming of signing the NBA's all-time leading scorer. Let's rank the Top 10 teams for LeBron James to play his final seasons with.\n\n10. Atlanta Hawks\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks ultimately passed on Bronny James twice, but the Hawks still have cap room to make an offer to LeBron. The move would give Trae Young an additional star to pair with.\n\nUnfortunately, it's unlikely that the Hawks will be materializing this, especially with a possibly disgruntled Young. Furthermore, the Hawks will have to tackle issues of depth. On the other hand, the Hawks will also have to convince James to take a massive pay cut to sign with the team, which is unlikely.\n\n9. San Antonio Spurs\n\nWith a blossoming Victor Wembanyama and a Hall of Fame coach in Gregg Popovich, James will have a solid foundation of winning if he joins the San Antonio Spurs. Although James has acknowledged the potential of Wemby and the greatness of Coach Pop, it's hard to see the Spurs being ready for a championship anytime soon.\n\nJames needs to win now, with his limited window. On the other hand, the Spurs are still in the process of laying the foundation of another potential dynasty.\n\n8. Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nAnother young team that could potentially land James is the Oklahoma City Thunder. With a wealth of young talent that's already gone through the playoffs, adding James could easily elevate them into the championship conversation. Furthermore, James has also complemented Sam Presti's abilities as a general manager.\n\nAcquiring Bronny James could even be possible with the Thunder's surplus of future first-round draft picks, which could entice LeBron to sign with OKC. But while SGA, Chet Holmgren, and Jalen Williams are promising teammates for James, it's another question of whether this core is already championship ready in James' closing window.\n\n7. Miami Heat\n\nLast time James played for the Miami Heat, the King led them to four-straight Finals appearances with two championships to show for. A return to the Heat would shock the NBA world. In fact odds placed the Heat within the top five to land James.\n\nHowever, it will be a difficult job. Although Pat Riley has always welcomed the return of The King, the Heat will have to sacrifice a lot of their pieces to make room for James. While having him team up with Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo will be formidable, the Heat are going to have to scramble for depth.\n\n6. Golden State Warriors\n\nA team-up between James and Stephen Curry would be easy money. With these two players nearing retirement, a team-up would give them both a chance to add at least another ring to their already decorated legacies.\n\nHowever, the Warriors are going to have to do a herculean job to land James. Furthermore, the Warriors already have an aging core surrounding Curry. As a result, it's unlikely that the Warriors will go all-in for short-term success. And LeBron will want to see what the Warriors get in return if they're able to trade away Andrew Wiggins and Chris Paul.\n\n5. Dallas Mavericks\n\nAnalyst Stephen Smith turned some heads when he claimed that the Mavericks could possibly be a team that drafts Bronny James in the 2024 NBA Draft. The move should easily draw interest from The King.\n\nOf course, Bronny ultimately landed in LA, but a reunion with Kyrie Irving could entice LeBron and teaming them with Luka Doncic would be unstoppable, at least on paper.\n\n4. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nOnly a few teams have the power to acquire LeBron James without having to take some significant losses, one of which is the Philadelphia 76ers. Moreover, they also have a former NBA MVP ready to pair James with, along with a two-way player in the Most Improved Player of the Year Tyrese Maxey.\n\nThe Sixers have been a legitimate contender in the East, and having James on board puts him in another great position to be in the Finals. However, Embiid's health and playoff performances have always been in question. And playing on the opposite coast as well as the opposite conference at Bronny would also be a drawback.\n\n3. New York Knicks\n\nEver since 2010, the Knicks have been salivating over the idea of having James power the franchise back to relevancy. With The King becoming a free agent again, those unfulfilled dreams are once again brought to light.\n\nHowever, unlike before, the Knicks will have to make some sacrifices to their already promising roster should they want to accommodate the four-time NBA champion. Bringing a title to New York also could be an exciting prospect for James despite similar drawbacks to Philly.\n\n2. Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nThere's no question that James returning to Cleveland for his final years in the NBA would be like a storybook ending. It's safe to say that there's no better place to end his decorated basketball career than the place where he started his NBA journey. As the chosen kid from Ohio, James fulfilled his promise of delivering an NBA championship.\n\nHowever, should the Cavs acquire James, will they have enough pieces to surround him with enough talent for at least one more championship? With another playoff elimination, it seems like the Cavs' promising core has been playoff ready but has yet to prove they can elevate to the next level. And some fans might not be over James' last two \"betrayals\" when he left for other teams.\n\n1. Los Angeles Lakers\n\nFor the past few seasons, James has been comfortable in Los Angeles. He has won an NBA championship and an In-Season Tournament title here. Furthermore, fresh from an In-Season Tournament title, the Lakers proved that the team is championship worthy, especially when healthy. Staying put in Los Angeles makes sense for The King.\n\nFurthermore, the Purple and Gold have also showed their intentions by drafting his son to further secure James' services. With the foundation in place, James should have what it takes to win at least one more title in Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

Previously, he signed an $85 million contract extension in 2021 after winning his fourth NBA Finals and continued to sign lucrative deals with the Lakers.\n\nDuring his two-decade-long career, James has amassed nearly $500 million from the three teams he has played for: the Lakers, the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers. In the years leading up to his tenure with the Lakers, James earned roughly $234 million, according to Spottrac.\n\nIn the 2023-2024 season, James averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.\n\nThe Lakers selected James' son Bronny in the second round of this year's NBA draft after his sole season at the University of Southern California, making the pair the first active father-son duo in the league.\n\n\"Pops over here getting emotional as hell just thinking about yall journey so far!,\" the NBA star wrote. \"Thank you both for allowing me to be your DAD and be apart of your compass through life's trials and tribulations!\"\n\nIn his only season at USC, Bronny averaged 4.8 points, 2.1 assists, 2.8 rebounds, and 0.8 steals, somewhat hampered by a cardiac arrest caused by a congenital heart defect.\n\nBronny was a highly touted recruit at Sierra Canyon High School in Chatsworth and was eventually selected by Team USA to play at the Nike Hoops Summit in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Canyon_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Canyon School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Hoop_Summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike Hoop Summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatsworth,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatsworth, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chatsworth, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/17/8828ce6a-b3fb-4c0c-84c4-61bec12f1104/thumbnail/1200x630g2/3987cb4cd05462e36c04665cb161bc1e/ap24104101241810.jpg?v=a23cb4bdf4fa7f3cb72e5118085577f9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Van Exel posted in excitement after Bronny James was revealed to be wearing number 9 with the Lakers, his old number with them. Van Exel showed support to Bronny James for taking his number.\n\nLeBron saw a post highlighting this and praised Van Exel for being an incredible player during his time.\n\n\"That's so TOUGH!! Nick the Quick was SO COLD!!!!!\"\n\nIt was a wholesome interaction between two legends of the game. Van Exel played for the Lakers for five years and was even named an All-Star in 1998, alongside Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. However, an alleged falling out with Shaquille O'Neal led to him leaving the Lakers that very same year. Despite the early exit, Van Exel really values his time with the Lakers.\n\nBronny James will be hoping to find similar success to Van Exel with the Lakers. However, most expect him to start with the Lakers' G League team, as he is still a very raw and undeveloped prospect. One draft expert recently pointed out his strengths and weaknesses as he enters the NBA, and there are some definite weaknesses in his game that need to be ironed out.\n\nHowever, there is little doubt that we will see Bronny play some minutes with the Lakers this season. Fans are excited about the prospect of seeing Bronny play with LeBron James, as they will be the first father-son duo to play together in the NBA.\n\nPaul George Excited To See Bronny And LeBron James Play Together\n\nPaul George spoke recently on his podcast about seeing Bronny and LeBron James playing together. He noted that the fans at the Crypto.com Arena will go crazy when Bronny sets his father up for an alley-oop, before praising Bronny as a prospect in the NBA, and the potential he has to be a success.\n\n\"I don't know how soon JJ Redick is going to throw Bronny out there. But it'll be cool to see. Just imagine, that Bronny throws a lob to LeBron. LA is going to go crazy... It's just the dynamic of that. Bronny (is) going to be on a little fast break, Bron is trying to chase it down... I think so. I'm a fan of Bronny. I think he has NBA potential for sure.\"\n\nBronny James had quite an emotional reaction when he was selected with the 55th overall pick by the Lakers. Even LeBron James was reported to have gotten emotional about the ordeal. It was a big moment for the James family, and perhaps we could see another big moment in the next few years.\n\nIf LeBron James plays till the 2026-27 NBA season, there is a chance that we can see him play not just with Bronny, but also with his younger son Bryce. That may be a little harder, as Bryce is expected to be a top prospect in the 2026 NBA Draft. But the thought of seeing LeBron play with both his sons in the NBA is tantalizing for many fans.\n\nRelated: LeBron James Unfollows Rachel Nichols After She Disrespected His Son Bronny\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

James is now free to sign with any team of his choosing.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that James remains in Los Angeles by signing a new deal with the Lakers, but that doesn't mean he has limited options. Even though not many teams have cap space this summer, there are a few that make sense as potential landing spots for him.\n\nFrom the Lakers to the Cavaliers, here are The King's best options in free agency.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best free agent options for Lakers\n\nJames loves living in Los Angeles and he has a pretty good team around him. The most likely course of action is that he renegotiates another short-term deal at the max that will give him the flexibility to leave if things go awry.\n\nThe Lakers might not have enough in the tank to beat the Nuggets, but they have avenues to get better next season. They will have their 2029 and 2031 picks available to trade, along with their 2024 pick on draft night. They've already been linked to many different stars. It will be a long summer full of Trae Young, Zach LaVine and Donovan Mitchell rumors.\n\nAdding an All-Star talent to this already-good roster could help the Lakers break through to the inner circle of true contenders. The Lakers can offer LeBron the most money, he's the most comfortable there and they have a pretty good team. They also now have his son, Bronny, in the mix and hired James' close friend JJ Redick as their head coach. That makes them the clear favorite to re-sign The King.\n\nMORE: LeBron James cryptic tweets timeline: What history of social media posts mean\n\nThere is certainly interest in James. Golden State tried to trade for him at the deadline but was rebuffed by both the Lakers and LeBron himself.\n\nMaybe that changes this offseason. James has previously stated that he'd love to play with Stephen Curry. He also has a good relationship with fellow Klutch Sports client Draymond Green.\n\nThe Warriors don't have cap space to sign James outright. They would have to get the Lakers' cooperation in a sign-and-trade to make a deal happen.\n\nWould Chris Paul, Andrew Wiggins, one of their young players, and their 2026 and 2028 draft picks be enough to get a deal done? That is the best offer that the Warriors can make.\n\nMORE: How Golden State can acquire LeBron in 2024 offseason\n\nIf James wants to prioritize winning his fifth ring, then going to Oklahoma City is his best bet.\n\nWhile the Thunder are undoubtedly very young, they are a great team that will be in championship contention next year without James. With him, they might be considered Finals favorites.\n\nJames has had to carry too much of the offensive burden in Los Angeles. He could take a backseat to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and be more selective about conserving his energy in his age 40 season. He'd also have the shooting lasers that he's complained about missing with the Lakers. Chet Holmgren would give him a stretch five that he hasn't had since Kevin Love, Jalen Williams is a career 40 percent shooter from deep and Lu Dort has quietly turned into a deadly 3-and-D weapon.\n\nOKC's acquisition of Alex Caruso only helps. In addition to being one of the NBA's best defenders, Caruso has history with James, having won a championship together in 2020.\n\nThe Thunder have a couple of different ways to offer James a max deal. They have about $35 million in cap space. They could do a sign-and-trade with the Lakers, giving up Dort, Cason Wallace and picks (of which they have too many to count).\n\nIf Los Angeles did lose James, then this would give them the quickest possible avenue to rebuild. They could get some good young prospects and a ton of picks, keeping their team competitive in the interim and dropping their payroll below the tax.\n\nMORE: Thunder clear winners in Josh Giddey-Alex Caruso swap\n\nThe Cavaliers are a good team whose pieces don't quite fit together. Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland have too much overlap. The same goes for Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. They may be looking to break up their core four.\n\nJames could fix those problems. The Cavs could send two of those pieces back in exchange. They would have to use some high-level players in a sign-and-trade because they don't have cap space and lack draft equity. On the day of the draft, they will have their 2024 and 2031 first-round picks available to move.\n\nJames has at least considered the possibility.

Now the impossible will have to occur for him to succeed there.\n\nThat LeBron James' son and namesake would end up in L.A. was always the plan. Former Golden State Warriors President of Basketball Operations Bob Myers said the quiet part out loud on Thursday on ESPN's draft coverage, sharing that \"Rich Paul is calling teams ... he's telling them, do not take (Bronny). If you take him, he's going to Australia.\"\n\nThat warning was also surely a threat. Sure, the message went, you wouldn't get Bronny anyway. But it was also clearly a way to say, without saying it, that drafting Bronny James would make you persona non grata with Klutch Sports, a headache no organization or ambitious GM needs.\n\nNothing better sums up the lengths LeBron James has gone to in order to ensure Bronny would be a Laker. Bronny's story -- his near-death experience, his famous name, the fact he wouldn't have been drafted if weren't for his father, and the upside he still has as a player -- was always going to include an early chapter about playing with his dad in L.A.\n\nLeBron Sr. wouldn't have it any other way, which was the inevitable part of this saga.\n\nIt's the near-impossible part -- the next step -- that will matter most going forward and largely shape Bronny's odds of succeeding, long though they may already be.\n\nBecause for his son to succeed, LeBron James will have to do what for him will be the most difficult and rare of things during his sparkling career: Cede the power he's accumulated and let others take it from here.\n\nHe has to fight the urge to interfere with his son's time as a Laker.\n\nThat means operating in the exact opposite way to what got Bronny to the Lakers in the first place.\n\nThe Bronny reality is a complicated one. On the one hand, he clearly is not NBA ready, a fact several NBA executives and scouts who had evaluated Bronny during his subpar season at USC and at the draft combine in Chicago last month told CBS Sports.\n\nBut it's also true Bronny would have probably earned his spot as a true prospect had he gone to college for one or two more years and further developed his game, as most believe would have been inevitable had his last name not been James.\n\nThat means there's an NBA player potentially in there but one who, by most accounts, needs more time, patience and the chance to learn and fail with smaller stakes than the NBA usually provides. And that is much more likely to happen if he isn't bird-dogged at every turn by perhaps the biggest name in NBA history.\n\nLeBron constantly weighing in and shaping the way the Lakers want to go about developing their young talent helps no one, no matter his intentions.\n\nIt's one thing to teach, help and guide your son. It's another to pull the strings from within his first professional organization, always hovering, never letting him and those around him have the freedom most rookies get to try and make it with all the ups and downs required.\n\nStepping aside, and not exerting the very power and influence he used to get his son to the Lakers in the first place, will not be easy for LeBron. This is a generational talent who has routinely decided the fates of his coaches, teammates, and GMs. He's had and used the massive influence and leverage that comes with his GOAT-level status. And it's mostly served him well.\n\nBut sometimes less is more. And that will be the challenge for the father who loves his son and now will need to find a way to get out of the way.\n\nWhat if Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka thinks Bronny needs ample time in the G League -- more, say, than LeBron feels is necessary?\n\nWhat if new Lakers Head Coach JJ Redick -- formerly LeBron's podcast partner -- isn't aligned with his benefactor on how many minutes his benefactor's son should be getting?\n\nWhat if Bronny's teammates, including the veterans on the team, start to resent a young player because of his dad?\n\nWhat happens when opposing teams go at Bronny with viscous enthusiasm, hellbent on getting one over on the kid with LeBron's name on his back?\n\nWhat happens when LeBron can't see these things clearly, and can't know when to get out of the way?\n\nSeems far-fetched?\n\nLast year, LeBron tweeted, \"Man Bronny definitely better than some of these cats I've been watching on league pass today. S--- lightweight hilarious.\"\n\nThis is a guy who handpicked his head coach in anticipation of re-upping with the Lakers in the coming days, who made sure that same team drafted his not-ready-for-the-league-yet son, who made sure his agency and good friend strong armed the rest of the league into not drafting Bronny first, and who has almost always gotten what he wants.\n\nThe line here between combining his love for his son with his all-time great basketball experience as hands-on mentor, and with being the ultimate problematic-helicopter-sports-parent, is thin.\n\nI hope Bronny makes it. And I get how a father's love for his son is all consuming. But that doesn't change the fact Bronny's best shot at succeeding rests in large part with his dad, all evidence to the contrary, giving him and the Lakers the space and permission to try and turn the 55th pick in the 2024 NBA Draft into a success story.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_reiter@cbssports.com", "name": "Bill Reiter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Myers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Myers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/29/5081c4a8-f6ce-4399-a665-062d4cb04af9/thumbnail/1200x675/a7f650ce1208d3991791971322ef903d/lebron-bronny-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

In the aftermath of Bronny being drafted, there were already memes being created about the possibility of the three members of the James family playing together.\n\nJames was already the oldest player in the NBA during the 2023-24 season at the age of 39. He was also still playing at an elite level with an average of 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds per game in 71 starts.\n\nUntil there is any indication James is slowing down, it would seem likely that he keeps playing long enough to have the possibility to play with or against Bryce.\n\nBryce is entering his senior season at Sierra Canyon.

They will participate in the California Classic summer league, with their first game against the Sacramento Kings on July 6th, providing the first opportunity for fans to see Bronny in action.\n\nLakers' Long-term Interest\n\nThe Lakers have been scouting Bronny for months, with Lakers' General Manager Rob Pelinka attending his debut NCAA game. The Lakers selected Bronny with the 55th pick, a strategy similar to their 2019 selection of Talen Horton-Tucker, who developed through the G-League and played crucial minutes in the 2020 playoffs.\n\nRookie Season Expectations\n\nBronny is expected to spend time in the G-League but will also get minutes with the Lakers. He will benefit from the mentorship of his father, LeBron James, and teammate Anthony Davis. Bronny's role will be to contribute effectively in limited minutes, focusing on being a \"stay ready\" player, developing his skills through extensive practice and game preparation.\n\nDevelopment Focus\n\nBronny's development will be a priority, with emphasis on improving his physical condition and shooting form, as seen in his progress between the end of the USC season and the NBA combine in Chicago. By the end of the season, the goal is for Bronny to be ready to contribute in meaningful games.\n\nTimeline and Goals\n\nWhile Bronny may not be a rotation player in the early part of the season, the objective is for him to gain valuable experience and potentially play spot minutes in important games from February to April. This gradual integration aims to ensure his long-term success and readiness for more significant roles in future seasons.", "source": {"uri": "theindustry.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Facts"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamahl_davis@theindustry.biz", "name": "Jamahl Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-way contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talen_Horton-Tucker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talen Horton-Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.theindustry.biz/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=797632&type=the-industry-dot-biz&hash=912961fa16a21f2a2d665a068e157106", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 487, "textEnd": 495}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Three days after LeBron James' podcast partner became the Los Angeles Lakers' head coach, the team drafted James' oldest son, Bronny.\n\nUnless they rename the franchise after him next, it's difficult to think of anything more the Lakers could do to make sure the top scorer in NBA history stays with them for the rest of his matchless career.\n\nWell, short of actually acquiring a third superstar for James after years of trying.\n\nAlthough James' future still won't be a sure thing until he formally decides where he'll play next season, the Lakers' addition of his 19-year-old son in the second round of the draft Thursday seems to make it extraordinarily unlikely LeBron will be anywhere but Los Angeles in the fall.\n\n\"The biggest moments in sports happen with the Lakers,\" general manager Rob Pelinka said. \"That's how we're built, and we're excited to see this story unfold.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOkoboji lakes remain at near record levels; water activities still curtailed as July 4 holiday nears Spencer, Iowa faces heavy flooding, roads closed, residents urged to shelter in place.

If LeBron Sr. picks up his $51.4 million player option for next season this week, he would guarantee he'll get to take his son to work in the fall.\n\nPelinka was careful not to get ahead of himself while triumphantly discussing Bronny's potential, but the GM acknowledged that a father-son pairing in purple and gold was \"something that could be magical.\"\n\n\"We know and have to respect, of course, that LeBron has a decision about his opt-out,\" Pelinka said. \"I'm sure he and his family and his agent will deliberate what they're going to do there, and he has freedom to decide whatever is best for him and his family. But if it worked out that he was on our team next season, NBA history could be made, and NBA history should be make in a Lakers uniform.\"\n\nWith their two major moves this week, the Lakers have made it clear they're determined to stick with James as their centerpiece and leader through his record-tying 22nd NBA season this fall and beyond.\n\nLos Angeles' new coach is JJ Redick, who hosted the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with James this year. Redick is a 15-year NBA veteran who has never coached an adult basketball game, yet the Lakers quickly made the unusual choice of hiring the broadcaster after Dan Hurley turned them down -- and Pelinka didn't deny that Redick's compatibility with James was a plus.\n\nThe Lakers then used the 55th overall pick on Bronny, who put up modest statistics in his only year of college at Southern California. Bronny James is undeniably talented, but an identical player with a different name would have been less likely to be drafted.\n\nPelinka and the Lakers scouted Bronny James extensively, and he performed solidly at the predraft camp and again in a workout at the Lakers' training complex, which was followed by a meeting with Pelinka. Pelinka said he never even asked Bronny what he thought about the potential pressure of playing alongside his father -- something that even LeBron has said Bronny wasn't necessarily eager to do.\n\n\"We really kept the draft process to Bronny being a Laker, and what we felt like we needed to do to help him become great,\" Pelinka said. \"We didn't talk a lot about that, just because (we) wanted to respect his dad's decision as a free agent, so that wasn't really something that came up.\"\n\nThat decision feels ever more like a formality now, depending on how James decides to do it. The 20-time All-Star and fourtime NBA champion has spoken repeatedly over the years of his desire to play a season with his son, and now the dream is a signature away from reality.\n\nJames could pick up his option for 2024-25, or he could sign a new extension for even more money. He could get a maximum three-year, $162 million deal that would give him the longest career in NBA history if he played out the contract.\n\nEither option would likely be just fine with Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who showed a similarly passionate loyalty to Kobe Bryant when she pushed to give him a $48.5 million extension for the final two seasons of his career despite his growing injury problems.\n\nBronny likely doesn't the get Lakers closer to winning now, but their choice with the 17th overall pick just might: Dalton Knecht, the high-scoring Tennessee wing who won the SEC Player of the Year award, appears to be one of the most pro-ready players in the draft, and not just because he's already 23 years old.\n\n\"In my mind, I thought there's no way a player that skilled would be available to us (at No. 17),\" Pelinka said.\n\nPelinka has repeatedly tried to keep fan expectations low for a major player addition to a team that lost to Denver in the first round of the postseason, instead targeting incremental improvements to the core around James and Anthony Davis -- along with a potential upgrade on the bench from Redick's innovative basketball mind.\n\n\"We've explored every upgrade we could to make our team better,\" Pelinka said. \"Trades in general have just because more difficult because of the new CBA system, and so there's less access to making those big moves than maybe there was under the old system. But it didn't keep us from trying to look at everything, and ways to put ourselves in a position to be better.\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to

We've also witnessed many siblings make it to the league, with some even playing on the same team. But in terms of a father and son sharing a locker room, that has never happened before.\n\nAn unprecedented level of greatness and longevity is required for such a scenario. LeBron is the only guy ever to achieve that, with Bronny, fortunately, being talented enough to join the NBA family.\n\n\"This is going to go all the way back to LeBron James in high school and how he rose with the expectations, all the way to different franchises winning, to now your son is in the NBA playing with you on the most storied franchise in NBA history,\" added Pierce.\n\nThe story is about to get longer\n\nLeBron is coming off a sensational Year 21, where he averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.3 assists, and 1.3 steals per game. He will be turning 40 at the end of the year, but unless there's a drastic decline, this story will only add more chapters.\n\nKing James is expected to sign a new contract with the Lakers, with reports saying that L.A. is preparing a three-year $162 million deal -- another one-plus-one contract is also an option. However, based on his previous performance, the superstar forward still has at least a few years left in the tank.\n\nThe LeBron story could get even more interesting if he takes the three-year max and plays it out. That's because his second son Bryce, who is considered a better prospect than Bronny, will be eligible to be drafted in 2026.\n\nIf James can last that long and Bronny does enough to stay in the league, Pierce will have to wait longer to watch the documentary.", "source": {"uri": "basketballnetwork.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Basketball Network - Your daily dose of basketball"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@basketballnetwork.net", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Piercing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Piercing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.basketballnetwork.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA3NDg5OTQ2MDM3MDAzNzE5/lebron-james-bronny-paul-pierce.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This doesn't factor in the cap holds for their free agents or expected 2024-25 salaries for their draft picks: Knecht at $3.83 million and Bronny James at $1.16 million.\n\nAs part of the league's new collective bargaining agreement, the first apron threshold of $178.66 million and the second apron threshold of $189.49 million come with limitations on the resources teams could have to construct their rosters.\n\nLeBron James' maximum salary for 2024-25 could be around $49.9 million. He could sign a three-year maximum contract worth around $162 million.\n\nBut he's reportedly willing to take a significant pay cut so the Lakers have the financial flexibility to add a significant player with the full non-taxpayer midlevel exception, which is projected to be around $12.9 million.\n\nJames would have to take a pay cut of around $16-17 million for the 2024-25 season to make this happen - meaning his salary for next season would be around $33 million. This would be an even more significant drop off from the $51.4 million 2024-25 salary he could have had if he picked up his player option.\n\nWhile James taking such a significant pay cut seems unlikely, his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, told ESPN on Saturday after James declined his player option that James is \"prioritizing a roster improvement\" and has been \"adamant about exuding all efforts to improve the roster.\"\n\nThe Lakers could also send out more salary than they take back in a trade to create more financial flexibility.\n\nRussell is a player the Lakers included in trade talks last season. He'll have an $18.69 million salary for 2024-25 and is on an expiring contract.\n\nWood ($3.04 million), Hayes ($2.46 million) and Reddish ($2.46 million) are also on expiring deals.\n\nThe Lakers could be a suitor for Klay Thompson, who won four NBA titles with the Golden State Warriors but is reportedly expected to depart the franchise after 13 seasons, depending on their financials.

He can sign a deal for up to three years and $162 million, per ESPN's Bobby Marks.\n\nDepending on the size of his deal, this could be the third contract of at least $100 million that James has received in his career. The others were a six-year, $109.8 million deal when he joined the Miami Heat in the summer of 2010 and his original four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Lakers signed in July 2018.\n\nEven though James is not known for taking discounts to help his team's salary cap, that appears to at least be in play this time. Chris Haynes of Turner Sports noted he's \"considering\" a deal that would allow the Lakers to obtain the full mid-level exception ($12.9 million) in free agency.\n\nThe Lakers also have the ability to use D'Angelo Russell, who told ESPN's Dave McMenamin on Friday he is opting in to his $18.7 million deal on Friday, in a potential trade to upgrade their roster.\n\nESPN's Bobby Marks noted in the wake of Russell's decision that the Lakers were bumping up against the second apron even before they tried to retain Max Christie in restricted free agency.\n\nOnce a team goes into the second apron, they are only allowed to sign their own free agents and draft picks, add players on minimum contracts and are unable to aggregate multiple salaries in a trade for a player on a bigger contract\n\nSpotrac estimates the Lakers currently have $127.3 million in salary commitments for next season, which doesn't include James since he isn't under contract.\n\nIf James were to negotiate a deal that would allow the Lakers to have the full mid-level, he would have to take an approximate discount of $10 million from his max.\n\nNot counting his rookie contract, James has only signed for less than the max twice in his career. He took a slight discount when he joined the Heat to allow them to sign Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade. He didn't get a full max on his three-year, $99.9 million deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer of 2016.\n\nJames certainly doesn't need the money if he doesn't want it. He's already the highest-paid player in NBA history by career earnings. That doesn't even include his off-court endorsements and earnings that made him a billionaire in 2022.\n\nIf the ultimate goal for James is to give the Lakers their best chance to improve the roster this summer so they can compete for a title in a loaded Western Conference, a discount of some sort would be the best approach as he prepares to become a free agent.\n\nIf James doesn't think there's a path for the Lakers to make themselves appreciably better, he should just take the max offer from them and not think twice about it.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_wells@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Adam Wells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bosh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Mandatory Credit: David Banks-USA TODAY Sports / David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOne of the worst-kept secrets in NBA draft history came to life Thursday when the Los Angeles Lakers selected one-and-done USC Trojans guard Bronny James, son of superstar forward LeBron James, with the No. 55 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nAfter months of speculation, James Jr. is finally a Laker, and the reaction between fans and media is split down the middle. That was the expected reaction of many, considering how polarizing the pick was expected to be.\n\nNonetheless, what is done is done, and like it or not, James Jr. worked hard to get to where he's at. The Lakers loved what they saw from him, especially Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka. Pelinka is the one responsible for drafting Bronny, and after he made the pick, he went on to explain why Bronny was the right choice for the Purple and Gold.\n\n\"The road to ultimate victory in the NBA is about two-way players,\" Pelinka said, \"if you're able to develop guys like that, that's a good recipe for success. Bronny is of that ilk.\"\n\nPlayers drafted late in the draft are unlikely to get any real playing time in the NBA. The hope for Bronny is that he develops into a player who is a plus on both sides of the ball, likely a 3&D type of player who can eventually contribute in a big way for the Lakers. Bronny is only 19, and the Lakers realize he will be a project.\n\nHis ceiling may not be high, but if he can pan out to be a Derrick White type of player, then the Lakers could have themselves the steal of the draft.\n\nThose are high expectations; however, there is a lot of room for growth and promise.\n\nNonetheless, Bronny will receive unwanted attention, both good and bad.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Draft_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Draft Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_lakers/01j1jr0cj03mmba95bht.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-05-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

LeBron will reportedly extend his stay by signing a new 3-year deal. However, this gave rise to another possibility that the 39-year-old could also play with his younger son Bryce James in the league, who instantly discarded the idea.\n\nThe 17-year-old was doing an Instagram live during which this question was shot at him. Bryce responded by saying, \"Nah, he's gonna be 42, Bruh.\"\n\nBryce is still in his junior year of high school and has at least two more years before getting through in the league like his brother. Being practical about LeBron's NBA career, the younger James stated that by the time he gets drafted, his father will be 42 and might retire.\n\nIf LeBron extends his contract with the Lakers, he would have a maximum of three years, which is reportedly the time he wishes to spend on the hardwood. But for now, he only wants the spotlight to be on Bronny as it is his big moment, and he appreciates everyone's support for his son.\n\nAfter the Lakers gave Bronny James the number 9 jersey, one of its previous owners, Nick Van Exel, came forward to show his support for Junior James. LeBron reacted to his energetic message on X (FKA Twitter).\n\nSharing the post which had highlighted Nick Van's two-word message, LeBron wrote, \"That's so TOUGH!! Nick the Quick was SO COLD!!!!!\"\n\nLeBron's X statement underlines the former guard's excellence in the Lakers' jersey, which makes him one of a kind.\n\nNow, it'll be interesting to see whether the four-time champion decides to share the same locker room with his son or leave the Lakers after six seasons. All eyes will be on LeBron, though deep down, everyone knows what his decision will be.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Van_Exel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Van Exel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/LeBron-James-and-Bryce-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

With the selection of current Lakers star LeBron James' son, criticism has come in floods to Bronny citing nepotism as being the deciding factor being drafted rather than his talent at playing basketball much to the dismay of O'Neal.\n\nThe basketball legend would come to the defense of Bronny saying he does not deserve the scrutiny he is getting since he has no choice to \"live up to what\" his father has done before him. O'Neal knows the newest Lakers star personally has having a close relationship, even calling him his \"nephew.\"\n\n\"I would like the scrutiny to get off of Bronny James, my nephew, he's a kid, great kid, all he wants to do is play,\" O'Neal said. \"It's unfortunate that kids like ours have to live up to what we have done. I tell my kids all the time, pressure is when you don't know where your next meal is coming from, you don't have to be me, I want you to be better than me. I'm not talking about as a player, but as a person.\"\n\nO'Neal knows Bronny James wants to make it on his own with Lakers\n\nO'Neal also talked about the sympathy he has for Bronny James as he is only 19 years old dealing with the media cloud that has surrounded him not just because he is the son of LeBron, but also because he is following in his footsteps in basketball. The current basketball analyst would say that \"as a kid they want to make it for themselves.\"\n\n\"Like all that's unnecessary, kids 18, 19 years old, I hope he gets drafted, I hope he makes it, and I hope he can do it on his own,\" O'Neal said. \"One thing that would be a bad look is them saying you know you only made it because of your daddy. You know as a kid they want to make it for themselves, and he will.\"\n\nO'Neal was not the only person in the basketball media that had praise for Bronny as even Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green gave his input. He would even go as far as to say that Bronny \"is going to end up being a better pro than a lot of these players in the draft\" which is a high bar to set for the Lakers rookie.\n\n\"I actually think Bronny is going to end up being a better pro than a lot of these players in this draft,\" Green said on his self-titled podcast called \"The Draymond Green Show.\" \"Has the athleticism, has the basketball IQ, plays the game the right way. I think he's going to be a good shooter in the NBA...He has LeBron James' DNA, and I'm going to take the bet on that.\"\n\nLakers' Rob Pelinka talks how \"magical\" it is for Bronny to be on team\n\nThe selection of James in the second round also made history as with the team up of LeBron and Bronny James as a father and son duo, it will be the first time in the NBA that has happened. Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka talked about how \"magical\" that relationship will be with the team.\n\n\"In the history of the NBA, there's never been a father and a son that have shared an NBA basketball court and that feels like something that could be magical,\" Pelinka said who also serves as the Vice President of Basketball Operations. \"We know, and have to respect of course, that LeBron has a decision on his opt-out ... but if it worked out that he was on our team next season, NBA history could be made. And NBA history should be made in a Lakers uniform.\"\n\nIn any rate, the Lakers are looking to improve after finishing at the seventh seed with a 47-35 record where they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in five games against the Denver Nuggets. This time around, there will be a different head coach in JJ Redick who will coach the father-son duo.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_weinberger@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Zachary Weinberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Shaquille-ONeal-doesnt-hold-back-on-criticism-of-Bronny-James.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

He also gave examples of the Milwaukee Bucks star player Giannis Antetokounmpo's brother, Thanasis, and mentioned that Thanasis never had a start for the Milwaukee Bucks; he's on their bench.\n\n\"The only reason he would get drafted is because his dad is LeBron...

As a result, the rumor mill suggests the franchise may pursue Klay Thompson. And from the sounds of it, James is \"hopeful' that is the case.\n\nAll signs are pointing toward Thompson departing from the Golden State Warriors this offseason. Rumors are the Dallas Mavericks are interested in potentially signing the veteran shooting guard. However, LeBron James reportedly hopes the Lakers make a run for Klay Thompson, according to NBA Insider, Marc Stein.\n\n\"As we've been reporting for 24-plus hours: Klay Thompson's departure from the Golden State Warriors looks increasingly imminent ... with LeBron James hopeful, per league sources today, that the Lakers can mount a bid to challenge Dallas.\"\n\nAlthough it was a down year for Thompson, he's still considered to be a consistent shooter from beyond the arc. Additionally, he can serve as a consistent third-scoring option for a team aiming for a deep playoff run next year. For that reason, it makes sense why the Lakers and Mavericks are showing interest in the veteran guard.\n\nKlay Thompson finished this last season averaging 17.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game. Those are numbers most teams in the league would welcome from a veteran shooting guard. His market should continue to heat up as potential playoff contenders should be hitting up this offseason.\n\nHow the Lakers get back on top of the Western Conference\n\nLos Angeles is taking a big gamble on hiring JJ Redick as head coach. But the potential of him being a star coach was seemingly too high for the franchise to pass up. The Lakers are clearly thinking about the long-term with that hire but aren't forgetting about the short-term either.\n\nLeBron James should eventually re-sign with the Lakers. But the team has an opportunity to land a legitimate third option to help James and Anthony Davis. Combine that with solid depth and suddenly you have a threatening team in the Western Conference.\n\nBut will it be enough for LA to overcome teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder, Denver Nuggets, or Dallas Mavericks? We won't know the answer to that question until next year's playoff race. But ultimately, the Lakers are in a position to make some drastic improvements to the roster.\n\nAfter having a solid draft, the Lakers can now focus on free agency. The key move they have to make is to find that veteran player LeBron James is demanding. If Klay Thompson is not the answer then LA should pursue someone like James Harden or Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas. A prime shooter would make more sense though, so don't be surprised if the front office prioritizes Thompson and Harden over Valan\u010di\u016bnas.\n\nSo, retaining LeBron James and Anthony Davis is certainly the plan.

Harden was cited by ESPN as a player that James would be willing to take a pay cut to land.\n\n\"The type of player that James would be willing to make a financial sacrifice for would be an established veteran playmaker such as James Harden or Klay Thompson, or an established big man to play alongside Anthony Davis -- such as Jonas Valanciunas,\" ESPN's Dave McMenamin reported.\n\nIf James takes a pay cut, the Lakers will use the full mid-level exception to lure an impactful veteran. It is worth $12.9 million next season.\n\nHarden would be an interesting fit alongside James and Anthony Davis. He'd give the Lakers an elite playmaking option, taking some pressure off James.\n\nHarden is no longer the elite scoring threat he was in his prime. However, the 34-year-old guard can distribute and hit from deep. Harden averaged 16.6 points and 8.5 assists last season while shooting 38.1 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nHarden has yet to say much about his future plans. His Clippers co-star, Paul George, opted out of the final year of his contract on Saturday, June 29.\n\n\"I don't even know,\" Harden said of his future after the Clippers season ended in May. \"You are asking a lot of questions that I don't have the answer to or haven't even thought about.\"\n\nJames may be willing to take a pay cut, but he's also not willing to wait around. He'll join Team USA for camp next week to prepare for the Paris Olympics. His agent, Rich Paul, wants a deal wrapped up before James gets on the court, per ESPN.\n\n\"If LA cannot find an impact player to sign for the full MLE that would be created by James taking a paycut, James will seek the max,\" McMenamin reported. \"There can only be so much patience on James' part: Team USA camp begins a week from today in Las Vegas and he needs a deal before taking the court.\"\n\nJames will turn 40 next season and doesn't want to risk getting injured and not having a contract in hand. James is eligible to sign a maximum three-year, $162 million contract.\n\nHe averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds in 71 games last season with the Lakers. He earned his 20th All-Star nod and was named third-team All-NBA.\n\nThe other notable name mentioned is Thompson, who is expected to part ways with the Golden State Warriors. Much like Harden, Thompson is no longer in his prime. However, he can still score with the best of them and would provide a much-needed 3-point boost for the Lakers.\n\nThompson averaged 17.9 points per game last season and shot 38.7 percent from deep. He's averaged 41.3 percent for his career from 3-point land.\n\nAccording to NBA insider Marc Stein, James is \"hopeful\" the Lakers can make a bid for Thompson. And the interest appears to be mutual, per Brad Turner of the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"Klay Thompson is intrigued about playing with the Lakers and LeBron James, provided he re-signs with the Lakers,\" Turner reported. \"Thompson plans on talking with the Lakers, as well as Dallas.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Valan\u010di\u016bnas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1456687847-e1719704827224.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 1305, "textEnd": 1312}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Rob Pelinka and company are selling the move as a chance to make NBA history with a father-son duo on the professional level.\n\nWith Bronny James' NBA career officially underway, the USC product had to pick the jersey number he wanted. Playing for this franchise with so many retired numbers can be challenging to pick a number, but it seems he's decided to wear No. 9. A notable recent player to wear No. 9 was Rajon Rondo, who ironically could be on JJ Redick's coaching staff, but the most memorable player in Purple and Gold that sported that number was Nick Van Exel, who gave his stamp of approval on X on Friday:\n\nAlong with Van Exel being OK with the rookie guard wearing his old number, LeBron James also commented on his son being set to wear No. 9, as it appears he was a fan of the former Lakers star:\n\nKnecht also had to decide to make on what number he wants to wear as he got his NBA career started with the storied franchise. The former Volunteers star chose to go with No. 4, also worn by a notable former Lakers player, three-time NBA champion Byron Scott.\n\nOther players who have worn No. 9 for the Lakers include Matt Barnes and Luol Deng. In contrast, quite a few players in the past sported No. 4, such as Luke Walton, Ron Harper, Antawn Jamison, Adrian Dantley, Ryan Kelly, Joe Hutton, and Frankie King.\n\nAs a result of the Lakers bringing in Bronny James with their second-round pick on Thursday night in the NBA Draft, a lot of people have criticized the franchise for an extreme case of nepotism, especially after the team recently hired a friend and podcast co-host of LeBron James in JJ Redick.\n\nESPN's Stephen A. Smith and Adrian Wojnarowski fired back at critics for this claim, as they believe nepotism is rampant in the NBA.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_ward@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Ryan Ward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Tennessee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Van_Exel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Van Exel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajon_Rondo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajon Rondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Kelly_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Kelly (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Dantley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Dantley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luol_Deng", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luol Deng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Walton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Walton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antawn_Jamison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antawn Jamison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league.

He was diagnosed with \"an anatomically and functionally significant congenital heart defect\" by doctors and returned to USC's lineup to make his college basketball debut in December -- with his father on hand to watch.\n\n\"It was everything for my family,\" LeBron told reporters about the debut at the time. \"It was just an emotional, draining day, from the time we all woke up to the time that the buzzer hit zeros.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KcaTf7mXF_vtHiTbheDyfA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/bf49386443209bb8ee90037e7bc97fff", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 180, "textEnd": 187}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

His dad did him no favors. What if other players think he gets more playing time than he deserves because he's LeBron's son or takes one of their jobs? What if LeBron wants him to get more time than he deserves? Think Doc and Austin Rivers. Terrible move for Bronny and the Lakers.\n\nAlvin S. Michaelson\n\nMarina Del Rey\n\nShame on Jeanie Buss, shame on Rob Pelinka and shame on the Lakers organization for selling their soul to team James. Nothing against Bronny, but the younger James wasn't even good enough to have any meaningful impact at USC. So not only have the Lakers wasted a second-round pick on Bronny, but more important, these actions will potentially cost a deserving youngster a valuable spot in a very limited NBA players pool.\n\nGreg Nersesyan\n\nNorth Hollywood\n\nLakers use a valuable draft pick on Bronny James? In high school, Bronny didn't even make his all-league first team. On a very bad USC team last year, he didn't start and averaged less than five points a game. He will add absolutely no value to the Lakers roster. They could have signed him as a free agent as no other team would certainly have drafted him unless his father was on the team. I'm 75 years old. Draft me....it'll make the same difference in the Lakers' championship chances. And I'll play for the league minimum.\n\nJack Nelson\n\nLos Angeles\n\nSo now it's official, the Los Angeles LeBrons have officially been held hostage by LeBron James and Rich Paul. The successful negotiation involved a $50-million contract for a 40-year-old, a draft choice for a player who couldn't even start for his college team and a head coach who has never coached a single day in his life but shares a podcast with James.\n\nTwo years from now, LeBron will be retired, the Lakers will have yet another new coach and the 55th pick will be the 11th man off the bench. And the Lakers will not see the playoffs again until the next decade.\n\nBob Goldstone\n\nCorona Del Mar\n\nBronny James likely has had better, individualized coaching than any other player ever drafted into the NBA. So before he or the Lakers are criticized, let's wait to see Bronny's game.\n\nEvery coach who has won a championship with the Lakers did it during their first season, even Mike Dunleavy got to the '91 Finals. So will Redick get it done after one or follow Ham out the door after two?\n\nRuben Hernandez\n\nEl Monte\n\nStunner. JJ Redick plans to take the Lakers to a championship. That's what they all say! In fact, they have said. Even Mike (Train Wreck) D'Antoni and Darvin (Turnovers Are Just Part Of The Game) Ham blathered that one out. We all know how those stories ended. And they were authentic, professional coaches. Oh, well, when the Lakers become unwatchable this season, we can always tune in to the Clippers for a reminder of what genuine NBA coaching looks like.\n\nThomas Bailey\n\nLong Beach\n\nI'm not sure why JJ Redick thought it was necessary to drop two f-bombs during his introductory news conference. I sure hope he didn't do that giving his fourth-grade team their pregame talk.\n\nSteve Briseno\n\nMission Viejo\n\nI'm 79, a retired school teacher, and I can cuss with the best of them. But, JJ Redick's f-bombs on national TV offended me and many others. Sorry, JJ, you just lost a fan.\n\nDavid Martinson\n\nCosta Mesa\n\nThe Times' article on UCLA basketball and NIL was really not shocking as UCLA and USC now make more moves than the Lakers and the Clippers. Thank you, NCAA, for destroying the game we used to love.\n\nWasn't it more fun to watch players develop from freshman, onward ? Can you imagine 50 years ago, Bill Walton transferring from Westwood to San Diego State?\n\nFred Wallin\n\nWestlake Village\n\nThe professionalization of college basketball and football has finally separated those sports from any meaningful \"college education.\" Universities are now just free minor leagues for the pros. Sad.\n\nHenry A. Hespenheide\n\nHermosa Beach\n\nLike Sammy Roth, I too am a lifelong Dodger fan, following them as an 8-year-old when they came here in 1958.\n\nWhile I'd rather not get into politics and have it ruin the last vestige of enjoyment, sports, his one-sided argument opened up a huge can of worms.\n\nFirst of all, I can refer him to articles from Time, Newsweek, etc., from the 1960s that \"claimed\" the next Ice Age was coming in 10 years because of global warming. Well, what happened!? We're still here, and the arguments on both sides of this issue are scientifically based. There's plenty of supporting data that we're not on the brink of destruction. And, to make such slanted and biased statements as \"human civilization is in a terrible bind, and it's largely Big Oil's fault\" is simplistic and ridiculous. The gradient approach to cleaner energy is what's practical.\n\nSo, why don't we just leave politics out of the Sports section and not bicker and argue.\n\nRick Solomon\n\nLake Balboa\n\nI agree with Sammy Roth's column about the Dodgers cutting ties with Big Oil because Union 76 no longer provides the little Styrofoam balls that we all used to put on our car antennas. Another sign of the end of an era.\n\nWhoever designed your new uniforms, I'd ask for my money back. In one word -- awful.\n\nSharon Shilkoff\n\nWoodland Hills\n\nSurely, the Dodgers realize that in an era when statistical rankings now include launch angle, sweet spot, barrels, exit velocity and batted ball distance, Shohei Ohtani, who leads the major leagues in several of those categories, is compelled to swing hard for the fences on each pitch because every game takes on the appearance of a \"home run derby.\" Why then would they discourage him from doing the same thing as part of an All-Star skills competition?\n\nSteve Ross\n\nCarmel\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

That said, the Philadelphia 76ers, a win-now team with cap space and looking for an elite wing, has to at least make the call.\n\nHistorically, LeBron has used free agency -- and the threat of free agency -- to get teams to make the roster and other changes he wants to see. This offseason, the Lakers fired coach Darvin Ham and replaced him with LeBron's podcast partner, J.J. Redick, and drafted his son Bronny at No. 55.\n\nLeBron would still like to see more talent added to the roster and thinks this can help open up a path.\n\nThe Lakers are also expected to be aggressive in looking for a trade, dangling D'Angelo Russell and his $18.7 million expiring contract plus a couple of first-round picks to see what that might return.\n\nThe Lakers have said they would like LeBron back on any contract he wants. The max they can offer him as a free agent is three years, $162 million (the over-38 rule limits length), and that can be with a no-trade clause (LeBron now meets the league criteria for that). Based on Haynes' report about the mid-level exception, LeBron may be willing to let this hang out there well into July before signing, trying to free up space for the Lakers.

If he enters free agency, he could re-sign with the Lakers, and play side-by-side with his son.\n\nBronny enters the NBA after one season at USC, with LeBron and family in attendance at his games in L.A. when the Lakers were in town. Similarly, Bronny was a fixture at LeBron's games from Cleveland to Miami and L.A.\n\nLeBron was selected first overall in 2003 - 21 years and one day before Bronny - and is set to enter his 22nd NBA season, tying him with Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history.\n\nIn a career that's already been a one-of-one, there are still more firsts for LeBron (and Bronny) to achieve.\n\nAnother day, another venue, but the same dreams being fulfilled as 28 players heard their names called in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft on Thursday from ESPN's Seaport District Studios in New York.\n\nCollective Joy: Colorado guard KJ Simpson was overcome with emotion when the Hornets landed him with the 42nd overall pick.\n\nFamiliar Crosstown Rivals: With the 46th overall pick, the LA Clippers selected Minnesota wing Cam Christie, bringing him to Los Angeles where his older brother, Max, plays for the Lakers.\n\nFrom Nigeria to Philly: With the 41st pick, the 76ers selected the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year Adem Bona out of UCLA with his mother by his side and a Sixers fan back home in Nigeria.\n\nInternational Flavor: 11 international players from 10 countries were selected in the second round, including some countries that have not been represented at the draft in years.\n\nCollege Standouts: A slew of notable names from the college game also found new homes on Thursday.\n\nThe 2024 Draft is complete, but offseason decisions still loom around the league.\n\nThe free agent negotiation period officially opens this Sunday, with stars like LeBron James, Paul George, Klay Thompson and James Harden all eligible to test the market.\n\nBefore the madness begins, get caught up on the free agency timeline, format and top players.\n\nThe action doesn't stop there.

The 19-year-old son of Lakers' star LeBron James was selected 55th overall in the 2024 NBA Draft. Since his pick, all the spotlights have fallen on the young guard. While many have criticized the Lakers' move and called it \"nepotism,\" some have praised it and extended their support for Bronny. The latest is former guard Austin Rivers, who is accustomed to the taste of such bitter remarks.\n\nBashing the critics on the \"Off Guard\" show, Rivers said, \"People are so caught up in, 'Well, he's only going because...' Okay, so what? Who cares? It doesn't mean he can't become a good player. Just because he's getting drafted because of his dad doesn't mean he can't play basketball or won't become a pro eventually.\" (After 4:00)\n\nMany have claimed that Bronny got the spot in the franchise because he is the offspring of LeBron James. Austin, the son of Bucks HC Doc Rivers, has faced backlash during his time on the hardwood. So, he came to defend the 19-year-old.\n\nNow that Bronny has a fixed spot on the LA team, the focus is on the 39-year-old. LBJ hasn't confirmed his contact situation yet, but there are reports that he might consider taking a pay cut for his son.\n\nESPN's Dave McMenamin broke the news that LeBron James has preferred opting out of his last year's $51.4 million contract with the LA franchise.\n\nThe Lakers recently offered him a contract worth $160 million, but it appears that LeBron wants to push it further. The 4-time champion, instead of entering free agency, has decided to stay with his current team and could re-sign a max $162 million contract later.\n\nThe father-son duo, LeBron and Bronny, would make history when they appear together on the hardwood, something that has never been seen in basketball before.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Austin-Rivers-and-Bronny-James-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

For the Los Angeles Lakers, it is a day that will carry significant implications.\n\nLeBron James, as well as starting point guard D'Angelo Russell, both have player options for the 2024-25 campaign. What they decide to do with those options, not to mention whether they will stay or go, will largely color the team's chances of success.\n\nMany expect James to opt out and then remain with the Lakers on a new contract. That new contract could pay him somewhere in the area of $160 million over three years, but Brian Windhorst said on the \"Hoop Collective\" podcast that the 39-year-old might be open to taking at least a bit of a pay cut.\n\n\"If Russell opts out, the Lakers will have a window to do something. If LeBron takes less than the max... this is not my idea, I didn't come up with this. If LeBron is willing to take less money than the max, they could open the possibility of using the full mid-level. Now it's not gonna be $1 million, it's quite a few million. Like around $10 or $12 million. I think he would take around $38 or $39 million instead of $50 million. It may be a non-starter. It definitely would be a non-starter if they didn't draft Bronny... It would not surprise me if when LeBron opts out, he doesn't sign right away. That he sees what can happen... And, look, LeBron may shut the door shut. But I do think if they had a plan of who they could sign for the full midlevel, they could take it to LeBron and he would at least listen. So that's another thing we're gonna watch over the weekend.\"\n\nIt would greatly help the Lakers, not to mention be an unselfish move, if James were to take significantly less than $50 million a year to remain with the Purple and Gold.

To go through that and make it back from that and be in the NBA within a year is a testament to his drive and work ethic. And I actually think Bronny is gonna end up being a better pro than a lot of these players in this draft because he has the athleticism, has the basketball IQ, plays the game the right way. I think he's gonna be a good shooter in the NBA. I'm just gonna take the bet that this kid works hard, which he does. He has LeBron James' DNA and I'm gonna take the bet on that. It makes sense. And then you watch him play and he's a good basketball player. I'm gonna take that bet because you got him at 55, so if he even become s a rotational player, you did great, and I think he could possibly become a rotational player in the next two years.\"\n\nThe pathway to Bronny becoming a legit NBA rotation player is to work on his 3-point shooting and perimeter defense. If he can succeed in those areas then he will be impactful despite his lack of size and playmaking chops.\n\nAfter not playing much at USC though, the main thing for James is just getting minutes to develop his game, and that will likely come at the G League level during his rookie year.\n\nThe Lakers announced the jersey numbers for their 2024 draft class and Bronny James is set to wear No. 9.

In fact, once you get past the first 15 picks in the first round, you're throwing the dice at best. By pick No. 55, you might as well just put in a joke pick for Waylon Smithers, Joey Buttafuoco or the ghost of Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nIn fact, in Bleacher Report's mock draft, which had him going exactly where he went, this is why the analysts thought he'd get picked by the Lakers: \"If he's still on the board deep into the second round, L.A.'s front office could feel pressure to select him, considering it's essentially a risk-free pick that late, and passing at No. 55 would signal to LeBron how little the team thinks of Bronny.\"\n\nHis main talent, in other words, is not insulting dad. Not exactly a promising skill set.\n\nBut, to be fair, Bronny had shown promise in high school and while his decision to come out of the University of Southern California for the draft after averaging just 4.8 points per game in his freshman year, he did have an excuse for poor performance: The guy was lucky to be alive after suffering a cardiac arrest during a basketball workout over the summer and having to rehab from that.\n\n\"Right now, Rich Paul is calling teams, don't take Bronny James, he's telling them 'do not take him,'\" Myers said, referring to Bronny's agent and close friend of LeBron's.\n\nMyers, who helped build the semi-dynastic Golden State Warriors of the late 2010s, added: \"He's saying don't take him, if you take him, he's going to Australia.\"\n\nThis is curious talk, and even more curious when you consider that Paul was talking about how \"deserving\" his client was of being drafted, since he had so much \"to prove\" at the pro level.\n\n\"He's got just as much to prove as anybody that was drafted with him Thursday,\" Paul said, according to Bleacher Report. \"He deserves to be in the NBA.\"\n\nAnd, as Bleacher Report noted, the move would work out for the Lakers, at the very least; \"LeBron James has yet to officially commit to playing another season with the Lakers, as it looks like his $51.4 million player option decision could come down to the Saturday deadline,\" the publication noted.\n\n\"Whether he takes the option or enters free agency, it seems like a foregone conclusion that the older James will return to Los Angeles now that he has the chance to become the first father to play with his son in NBA history.\"\n\nYes, well, this is hardly Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. playing together with the Seattle Mariners. The fact that James already enters the league with the tag of being a nepo baby is problematic enough, although he was rated highly enough in high school that he was once thought of as a first-round talent.\n\nIf you're picking in the second round -- where four of the players picked in 2023 have never even played in an NBA game, period -- Bronny would be worth taking a flyer on. Unless, of course, you were told that if you pick him, he goes to play in Australia. In other words, not only was his best draft attribute that he made daddy happy, his one demand was also that he made daddy happy.\n\nIf Bronny wanted to prove he was a bona fide NBA talent, as per his agent's words, this wasn't the way to do it. Maybe this does work out for everyone involved -- but it's certainly not a good look to start your career as the entitled son of the face of the franchise, picked merely to placate your father and keep him with the team.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_douglas_golden@westernjournal.com", "name": "C.

But as a sports fan, I have opinions on many different sports. In this edition of Mike On Sports, I wonder why LeBron James would do this to the son he loves.\n\nBronny James isn't an NBA caliber player, everyone agrees on this point. If he wasn't the son of one of the NBA's Mount Rushmore of players, he'd likely be back in college basketball next year trying to become a regular starter. Heck, if he wasn't LeBron's son he might not be a college basketball level player at all. But here we are. Bronny gets drafted in round two by the LA Lakers clearly at the insistence of his father and someone else's dream of being drafted falls to the wayside. Nepotism? For sure. But what about abuse? It's a strong term and the connotations don't apply here, but can we make a case this isn't good for the kid? We sure can.\n\nBronny James seems like a good kid. LeBron seems like a good dad. In fact, the hate for LeBron by many is confusing. Here's a guy who has been a good husband, a good dad and a good citizen all while dealing with the enormous fame that comes with being a prodigy at basketball. LeBron can be a hypocrite for sure and his social and political beliefs anger some, but as a person he's been solid. Name a LeBron James scandal. You can't.\n\nBut LeBron has overstepped here and it's going to end poorly for Bronny. Unless Bronny turns out to be a very solid 10-year pro in the NBA, he will be looked upon as a favor for his dad. He will be the ultimate example of nepotism in professional sports. Even if he does hang around the NBA for a decade as a bench player or even starter, he will never live up to his dad. And it will always come up that he was given a chance only because his dad was LeBron James -- always.\n\nAnd if he fails as many expect? If he's cut from the Lakers as soon as LeBron retires or leaves for another team? It will get even worse.\n\nLeBron has forced a franchise to hire a coach he does a podcast with and draft his son. A player won't make the Lakers team because of it. A kid won't get his NBA moment of being drafted or even given a chance at the NBA because of it. And a much more qualified coach will remain an assistant somewhere for at least another year because of it. LeBron is impacting families with his selfishness and hurting his own kid in the process. And it's all about LeBron.\n\nSo good for you LeBron. You are forcing everyone to abide by your rules and make your dream of playing with your son come true. It's perhaps what every other famous dad would do. I mean how many rich owners pass along franchise to their sons and how many sons of elite coaches get their chances because of their last name. It happens. But in this case, it's bigger than all that. Nepotism exists for sure, but this is about as a big a stage as you can get for nepotism.

ESPN, The Athletic and the Los Angeles Times all reported the decision earlier Saturday.\n\nThe move is among those coming just ahead of the NBA's free agency period, which formally opens at 6 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, though at least $1.2 billion in contracts already have been agreed upon because of new rules that allowed teams to speak with their own players about new deals -- in many situations -- starting on the day after the NBA Finals.\n\nAmong those already having agreed to deals that cannot be finalized until the new league year opens on July 6: Toronto teammates Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley, Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Pascal Siakam, and New York's OG Anunoby.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's also been expected that he would stay with the Lakers.\n\nThe Lakers selected Bronny James -- LeBron James' oldest son -- on Thursday in the second round of the draft, putting them in position to have the first on-court father-son duo in NBA history. And with a new deal, it's even possible that LeBron James could sign for a lower number than he could have commanded to give the Lakers additional financial flexibility for other moves.\n\nLeBron James is a four-time champion and is about $20 million shy of becoming the first player in league history to top $500 million in on-court earnings. Add in his many off-court ventures and investments, and his net worth has been presumed to be more than $1 billion for some time now.\n\nHe'll turn 40 in December and will tie Vince Carter this season in terms of most seasons played in NBA history; the 2024-25 campaign will be James' 22nd in the league. He averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists last season -- as the oldest active player in the league.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nPISTONS: Detroit declined a $19 million option for Evan Fournier, according to a person familiar with the situation. The Pistons acquired Fournier from New York before the trade deadline last season as part of a deal that sent Bojan Bogdanovic to the Knicks. The 31-year-old shooting guard from France averaged 7.2 points per game for the Pistons.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "heraldcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HeraldCourier.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@heraldcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

He then transferred multiple times in the span of seven months. In April 2023, James left Sierra Canyon in favor of Campbell Hall in Studio City, California.\n\nAfter playing a handful of summer league games with Campbell Hall, James decided to take his talent to Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. Three months later, James decided to return to Sierra Canyon.\n\nDespite only being in high school, Bryce has already showed signs that he has the foundation to potentially grow into an NBA talent.\n\nThe 16-year-old is already 6-foot-4 and has shined in games against other top talent in his age group. He scored 21 points in a Nike Elite Youth Basketball League game.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times recently reported that LeBron would likely opt out of the last year of his current contract with the Lakers. He has until 5:00 p.m. ET on June 29 to inform the team of his decision.\n\nAn opt-out would make the Los Angeles Lakers forward an unrestricted free agent. However, the belief within most NBA circles is that James does not intend to leave the Lakers.\n\nIn May, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said if James decided to opt out, the move would likely center on the structure of his contract. If James wants to add a no-trade clause to his deal, that could be achieved in a new contract.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNBA rules prevent no-trade clauses from being tacked on to existing contracts via extensions. Only 10 players in league history have been able to work a no-trade clause into their respective contracts.\n\nJames is projected to ultimately ink a three-year, $162 million deal.

The latest is his jersey number. The youngster cannot continue his No. 6 jersey from USC anymore, as his superstar father is his rightful owner in the Purple and Gold. So, the franchise gave him the number 9. As soon as the news broke out, one of the Lakers' own, Nick Van Exel, who donned the number from 1993 to 1998, reacted to the new update.\n\nShowing his support on X (formerly known as Twitter), the former player wrote, \"Let's gooooooo!!!!!!!\" While many have been critical about the move, Nick Van gave his approval.\n\nAfter playing for five seasons with the franchise, the former guard knows the challenges Bronny will face. So, he showcased his optimism and tried to boost the 19-year-old guard.\n\nLeBron is quite thrilled about Bronny wearing the Purple and Gold jersey. The 39-year-old proudly shares pictures of every exciting news related to Bronny on his Instagram story. The father-son duo will soon create history in the Lakers' colors.\n\nWhile many were convinced that the Lakers would be going back home with Bronny James, other franchises also had their eyes on LeBron's son.\n\nThe revelation was made in \"First Things First\" by Chris Broussard. \"There were four teams outside of the Lakers that had legitimate interest in taking Bronny,\" spilled the analyst.\n\nDisclosing the names, Broussard added, \"The Clippers, the Timberwolves - which was not as bad of a situation for him, I know they drafted a young point guard too before him - the Suns, but they wanted it because of LeBron and the Raptors.\" However, it was due to LeBron's agent Rich Paul, the other franchises backed off. Paul reportedly spread the word that if anyone other than the Lakers drafted Bronny then he would leave for Australia and play there.\n\nNevertheless, the former USC guard was selected by his desired team, so he can now start preparing for the upcoming challenges in the league.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Van_Exel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Van Exel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Broussard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Broussard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nick-Van-Exel-and-Bronny-James-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The two are set to make history as the first father-son duo ever in the NBA.\n\nThompson is expected to be on his way out of Golden State. According to The Athletic's Shams Charania, the Warriors are preparing to lose the five-time NBA All-Star in free agency.\n\n\"I don't think Lebron leaving but Klay should either go to LA or San Antonio,\" Howard posted on social media.\n\nThe Spurs have a future superstar in center Victor Wembanyama, but they only won 22 games last season. It's hard to see the fit for a 34-year-old Thompson on a Spurs team in the rebuilding phase.\n\nHowever, Los Angeles is a destination that would make sense. Thompson's potential fit with James and Anthony Davis, particularly as an added spot-up perimeter shooter, is a reassuring sign for the Lakers and their fans.\n\nDespite Thompson's down year, he finished last season averaging the fifth-most 3-pointers made per game (3.5). He averaged 17.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.3 assists.\n\nFather Time and injuries have robbed him of his elite defense, but he can still blow up a scoreboard any night. He's a solid piece that could give James and the Lakers new life as championship contenders.\n\nRelated: Paul George Has Next Steps Planned Out After Clippers Decision", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordy_mcelroy@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jordy McElroy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/33/7332ccec-dbc3-56c8-ad48-194cc895dbe6/6680d9cb87974.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Smith provided insight on Rich Paul amid Bronny James' draft saga.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers made headlines during the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft when they selected Bronny James with the 55th pick. Bronny, the son of LeBron James, impressed scouts at the summer Combine, although his lone college season has fans questioning if he deserved to get drafted. LeBron James' agent Rich Paul reportedly used an intriguing tactic to land Bronny James on the Lakers. Moreover, ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith gave some eye-opening advice on Paul's discourse.\n\nRich Paul allegedly called other NBA teams and told them not to draft Bronny James, according to the former Warriors GM and ESPN analyst Bob Meyers. Paul is a savvy agent, which is part of the reason some of his clients have been successful. However, he can also get under the skin of commentators like Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. Smith explained why Perkins needs to learn \"to ignore\" some of Paul's pushback on the rumors of his orchestrations.\n\nStephen. A Smith provides insight on Paul amid Lakers drama\n\n\"Let me tell Big Perk something about Rich Paul. Paul is somebody, first of all, I love him, we all love Rich. I mean, he gets on our damn nerves sometimes, stuff like that because it's Rich Paul you understand? That's what he tends to do. But we all got love for him. You must learn, Perk, how to ignore him [and his Lakers discourse],\" Smith said via First Take.\n\n\"Now I know that Rich Paul likes to go on podcasts and be like, 'Yeah nobody telling me to shut the hell up,' and all of this. Yeah, we do because Rich Paul thinks he's a producer. I don't know if you know this. Rich Paul thinks that Rich Paul should be sitting where we sitting. Rich Paul thinks that he should be sitting behind the scenes where the producers are and producing. I'm telling you what I know, this brother tries to produce sports television shows. This is what he tries to do. 'You should be saying this.' Man shut the hell up and do your do your job and let us do our job,\" Smith comically added.\n\nKendrick Perkins responded to Smith and gave his take on Paul amid the Lakers' drama.\n\n\"My thing with Rich Paul is, don't try to make people out look like liars when we knew that there was some truth to those rumors that LeBron James wanted to play with Bronny [on the Lakers]. And it's okay,\" Perkins said.\n\nWill Bronny James live up to the hype with LA?\n\nBronny James averaged just 4.9 points and 0.8 steals during his freshman season with USC. His numbers were a contract to his high school senior production. James averaged 13.8 points and 1.8 steals during his final year at Sierra Canyon. However, his stats do not tell the full story.\n\nIn July of 2023, James suffered a cardiac arrest during a USC basketball practice. Thankfully, he fully recovered and returned to the court, but his rhythm was understandably not the same. Despite James' down freshman season, he impressed NBA Combine scouts with his vertical leap and pro lane agility performances. In addition, he bolstered the perception of his offensive abilities by scoring 13 points in his second scrimmage and performing well in shooting drills.\n\nRegardless of all that has happened, the Lakers feel James will eventually be able to make an impact. it will be interesting to how the 19-year-old fares amid his professional debut.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

He was also, at around this time, a leader within the NBPA, and he saw the impact this had on his fellow players. Owners from other teams were able to nudge their own stars towards taking discounts because, hey, if LeBron James isn't earning the max, why should you? When he returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014, he vowed to make the max from that point. He has done so ever since, and the Los Angeles Lakers have reportedly been willing to pay him max money this offseason if he wants it.\n\nHowever, a new report from Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes suggests that James, for the first time in a decade, might be willing to take less if it helps the Lakers unlock the full mid-level exception to use on certain free agent targets. Doing so, in financial terms for James, would be costly.\n\nAny team that uses the full mid-level exception hard caps itself at the first apron. That figure is projected to come in at $178,655,000. As of this moment, the Lakers have $127,338,024 committed to 11 players: Anthony Davis, D'Angelo Russell, Rui Hachimura, Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Christian Wood, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish and Maxwell Lewis. We then add $3,830,280 as 120% of the scale amount for No. 17 overall pick Dalton Knecht (the industry standard is for rookies to make 120% of their scale figure, but technically they can go as low as 80%). We then add another $1,160,544, which is the projected rookie minimum for Bronny James. Finally, we throw in $12,859,000, the most recent projection for the non-taxpayer mid-level amount, which would go to whoever the Lakers are targeting.\n\nUnder this scenario, the Lakers would be able to pay James $33,467,152 next season, which would be roughly an $18 million pay cut from what his player option could have paid him. In reality, the Lakers would probably be paying him slightly less than that to maintain a little bit of flexibility for things like 10-day contracts and possible trades, to say nothing of re-signing Max Christie. Now, it's worth noting that many of these figures are projections and could change. The Lakers could also trade out a bit of salary to help pay James a bit more, though, to be honest, if he is willing to take a significant pay cut, he would probably rather they use any excess salary in trades for a significant upgrade. However you slice it, though, James would have to take a meaningful pay cut for this plan to be feasible.\n\nSo let's attempt to figure out what the Lakers could do with that extra flexibility. Here are a handful of options potentially at their disposal if James grants them the right to use the full mid-level exception.\n\nJonas Valanciunas\n\nWe'll start with the most obvious candidate on the board. The New Orleans Pelicans have a gaping hole at center right now after trading Larry Nance Jr., but they also have roughly $168 million in committed salary at the moment. That's nearly at the luxury tax line already. Keeping Valanciunas for mid-level money would take them above the first apron, which, depending on the final structure of the Dejounte Murray trade, they may not even legally be allowed to do. This isn't a team known for spending. It's far likelier that they trade Brandon Ingram to get a replacement center and that Valanciunas hits the open market.\n\nThat would likely suit Anthony Davis in particular just fine. He's played center primarily the past few seasons, but the Lakers won a championship with him at power forward, and adding a burlier big man would help protect him from some of the more physically taxing center matchups of the regular season. Playing two big men together would compromise the team's spacing to an extent, but Valanciunas is a career 34.8% 3-point shooter and has averaged 1.6 attempts per game as a Pelican. That number needs to go up a tick, but he's at least willing to fire when open. That's a start.\n\nIn the playoffs, Valanciunas has struggled to defend in space. That isn't an issue for Davis. If Valanciunas can get Davis through the regular season healthy and then effectively spell him as the backup in the postseason, that's more than enough. That he also brings some valuable interior scoring and rebounding to the table is a bit of a bonus. The Lakers would be able to maintain their identity as one of the NBA's bigger, bullying teams if they sign him, but he is not so expensive or accomplished that they would have to commit to being a full-time two-big team. That makes him a nice compromise at the center position.\n\nThe older stars: DeMar DeRozan or Klay Thompson\n\nWe all know the Lakers love their stars, and they have strong connections to two of them that don't have obvious homes right now. Klay Thompson's negotiations with the Golden State Warriors have seemingly reached an impasse. He is widely expected to leave the only team he has ever played for. His father, Mychal Thompson, was a champion playing for the Showtime Lakers of the 1980s. DeMar DeRozan grew up in Los Angeles. He nearly joined the Lakers in 2021 before they landed on Russell Westbrook. The Bulls traded for Josh Giddey, whom they plan to entrust the offense to moving forward, and that doesn't leave DeRozan an obvious role anymore, especially since Coby White isn't going anywhere and Zach LaVine is looking increasingly untradable.\n\nBoth players likely entered this process expecting to earn more than mid-level money. They have both earned more than $250 million in their careers, though, so even if neither wants to take a pay cut, they are positioned to do it for the right situation. LeBron James is doing his part by taking the pay cut, after all. If either of these two wants to be in Los Angeles, they have to do theirs as well.\n\nThe fits here aren't necessarily clean. Perimeter defense was this team's single biggest weakness last season. Thompson was, at one time, an elite perimeter defender. He's fallen off significantly since tearing both an ACL and Achilles. DeRozan was never a strong perimeter defender, and he's likely to continue to decline with age. Both of them are likely to dip offensively as well. Thompson just had the second-worst 3-point shooting season (38.7%) and third-worst scoring season (17.9 points) of his career. DeRozan's numbers last season were in line with his career averages, but he's about to turn 35 and his playing style is fairly physically demanding. Without a 3-point shot to fall back on, he stands to regress quite a bit if he continues to rely on low-percentage mid-range jumpers and getting to the foul line. Thompson, at least, would provide valuable shooting. That is going to be a priority for first-year coach JJ Redick, and it has been a weakness for Los Angeles ever since James arrived.\n\nIn truth, there are probably better fits out there than Thompson or DeRozan. But think about who James tends to seek out as teammates. He likes playing with stars, even when they aren't necessarily the best fits available to him (see Russell Westbrook). If he is leaving money on the table, odds are he is looking at the sort of teammates who have enough stature that joining him would mean doing the same. There are players we'll discuss here that might ultimately help the Lakers more, but the team needs LeBron's cooperation for this plan to work. Odds are, Thompson and DeRozan are the sort of players he's thinking about here.\n\nThe three-and-D crowd: De'Anthony Melton, Gary Harris and Caleb Martin\n\nThese players are obviously less flashy than Thompson or DeRozan, but they are the kind of role players that most winning teams need a few of. All three come with some sort of concern. For Gary Harris and De'Anthony Melton, it's injuries. Harris has had several throughout his career. Melton had a back injury last season, and back injuries tend to be among the scariest health issues that players can have. For Martin, fair or not, it's where he's coming from. The Lakers have a bit of a disappointing history of signing free agents away from the Heat. Neither Kendrick Nunn nor Gabe Vincent shined after switching coasts, though in fairness, both had injuries.\n\nBut all three of these players do the two things every contender needs out of its supporting pieces. They all shoot 3's: Harris is at 37% for his career, Melton is just below at 36.9%, and Martin is a bit worse at 35.7%. They all defend at least reasonably well, though Harris wasn't quite as good last season and Martin is more of a supporting defensive piece than a high-impact defender himself.\n\nThe Lakers are going to have to find 3-and-D players somehow. They'd probably prefer to do it internally (again, bringing back Max Christie will be a priority) or on the cheap, but these are proven 3-and-D commodities, and nowadays, those tend to be pricey.\n\nTrades\n\nThe new CBA tweaked the rules regarding the mid-level exception slightly. In the past, it could only be used to sign free agents. Now, however, it can be used to absorb salaries in trades. It cannot be aggregated, so it's not as though the Lakers could combine it with another salary to get an expensive player, but they can use it to bring in a player making anything up to that projected $12.859 million figure. Many of these players would require the Lakers to send draft picks back, but here is a list of players below that salary line who would make sense for them:\n\nWendell Carter Jr. -- He is, essentially, the perfect Lakers center. He's shot nearly 35% on 3's since joining the Magic while attempting 4.2 of them per 36 minutes. He's a strong defender who has in the past given Nikola Jokic as much trouble as any post defender in the NBA (which is to say not much, but hey, that's still better than everyone else because it's the freaking three-time MVP we're talking about here). He can play with Davis or without. And Orlando is reportedly targeting Isaiah Hartenstein in free agency. If the Magic sign another center and Carter becomes available, he becomes an easy Laker fit. They could try to absorb him with the mid-level exception, or they could send the Magic D'Angelo Russell, whom they have been linked to in the past, and proceed to use the mid-level exception on another perimeter player to replace Russell.Robert Williams III -- He's a major injury risk, but he could probably be had for less than a first-round pick after Portland just drafted Donovan Clingan. He may have won Defensive Player of the Year in 2022 if he hadn't gotten hurt, and he and Davis would be the most mobile pair of big true big men in all of basketball. Good luck scoring on those two.Larry Nance Jr. -- A former Laker who doesn't give the Lakers the burly center they'd want next to Davis, but would give them a solid backup who could stylistically imitate Davis defensively at least. The Hawks may want to keep Nance, but with Onyeka Okongwu and Clint Capela still in place, they have a center glut right now.Gary Payton II -- The Warriors may need to shed some salary to accommodate a splashy star addition (or to potentially re-sign Thompson without breaking the bank). The Lakers have been dying for an Alex Caruso replacement ever since he left. Payton is the league's closest analog as a lockdown perimeter defender, barely passable shooter and excellent off-ball offensive player in space.Walker Kessler -- The Jazz have reportedly been open to moving him, and the Lakers would love to have a second elite defensive big man without having to pay top dollar for one. Kessler still has two years left on his rookie deal, and the Lakers could sweeten any trade offer by removing the top-four protection on the 2027 first-round pick they already owe the Jaz..\n\nOther candidates could pop up. These are just the 10 that make the most sense at this moment. But the Lakers could change the roster somewhat drastically in the coming days, and James possibly leaving money on the table gives them the flexibility to do it in almost any way that they can imagine.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

So just because that's my aspiration or my goal doesn't mean it's his. And I'm absolutely ok with that.\"\n\nBronny's NBA prospects became hazy on July 24, 2023, when he went into cardiac arrest during an offseason workout with the Trojans.\n\nJames was treated for a congenital heart defect in Los Angeles and New Jersey before being cleared to make his collegiate debut last December.\n\nJames, who was listed as 6-foot-4 at USC but measured 6-foot-1 \u00bd in socks at the NBA's scouting combine, had an inconsistent freshman season with the 15-18 Trojans.\n\nJames averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 25 games while shooting 36.6 per cent from the field and 26.7 per cent from 3-point range.\n\nDespite lackluster shooting numbers in college, James displayed a confident shooting stroke during combine workouts, and his 40.5-inch vertical leap illustrated some impressive explosiveness.\n\nAs a small guard with an inconsistent shooting touch, James' contributions early in his career will mainly be on the defensive end of the floor. Throughout his season at USC, James showed the athleticism, toughness and intelligence to project as a good defender at the next level.\n\nJames has good length for his size, with a wingspan over 6-foot-7, and he carries plenty of muscle on his 210-pound frame - two features that should help him on the defensive end immediately.\n\n\"Size is really the only issue for him on defence,\" an NBA general manager told The Ringer in April. \"If he was actually 6-foot-4 or even a bit bigger, he'd have really excellent potential.\"\n\nThe NBA community appears understandably torn on James' future.\n\nOn one hand, small guards who struggle to shoot rarely get chances at the next level, and it's even rarer that they make an impact. Without James' strong family ties, he likely would have been advised to return to college to show improvement as a sophomore.\n\nJames is not without upside, however, and he has shown rare explosiveness and defensive prowess that give some scouts hope he can be a long-time NBA contributor.

Bryce James doesn't believe he will get chance to play with his father LeBron in the NBA\n\nAmongst the many memes and jokes made about Bronny James becoming a Laker, the funniest one by far has to do with his mother Savannah James. Most of the jokes have been linked to the possible or alleged nepotism after Bronny was drafted by the Lakers when his father is in the middle of negotiations to remain at the team. Also, most of the jokes and reactions have been mean-spirited against the kid. Even his father decided to unfollow journalist Rachel Nichols after she criticized Bronny's arrival to the Lakers. LeBron has very little time for vitriol and criticism he deems unwarranted. As a father of the kid, he obviously feels hurt at everything negative coming his way.\n\nSavannah James reacts to another joke that involves her\n\nSavannah James is naturally also protective of the kid, she was right there shedding a tearn when he was announced as a new Lakers player and it was a beautiful moment. What came after was tough to swallow but there was a joke that did get a laugh out of Savannah James. An internet user said: \"It has been discovered that LeBron James is sleeping with his newest teammate's mom.\" She immeditely reacted through her Instagram stories with a laughing emoji and made everybody laugh out loud with her. But the reality is that the road will be upwards for Bronny.\n\nAs far as Bronny, there has been some level of reaction from his part through his social media accounts. He posted a video where he is making comparisons of his father and him shooting hoops before the annoucement. After the announcement, he posted multiple celebrating images and edited graphics of the achievement. Clearly, Bronny James is thrilled of what he is currently experiencing and happy for what's coming for him. It's good to know that despite all the criticism, Savannah James can still take a joke like the one she reacted to.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Nichols_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Nichols (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Forgiveness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Forgiveness", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/7012ae5804ffebdbc8a6a35614b90619/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/30/17197004387268.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

In a legacy that includes 17 championships and numerous all-time greats of the game -- now adding a whole new chapter with the father-son pairing of Bronny and LeBron -- the Lakers aren't acting like a team that will stop taking big swings.\n\nThe fact that LeBron is entering his 22nd NBA season basically mandates that the Purple and Gold go all-in for at at least one more push for the Larry O'Brien Trophy. Drafting Bronny felt like a good-faith gesture that LeBron will be back with the Lakers on a lucrative three-year contract. His decision to opt out on Saturday doesn't mean The King will explore his options on the open market.\n\nIn fact, LeBron is willing to take a pay cut to secure a full mid-level exception role player.\n\n...And now that Klay Thompson is hitting free agency, having won four championships with the Warriors, he seems like the ideal fit in LA in so many different ways.\n\nShams is reporting that the Clippers, Mavs and Lakers are all intrigued by adding Klay to the mix. If those are indeed the only three aggressive suitors, to me, the Lakers are the no-brainer pick.\n\nThe Clippers have Kawhi and a whole lot of nothing else in terms of core players who've won championships. Dallas just made it to the NBA Finals, but if I were him, I'd wonder how long Kyrie Irving will stay on good behavior. Although Texas is appealing for not having a state income tax, the Lakers have -- that's right -- a huge piece of history to sell Klay on.\n\nKlay's father, Mychal Thompson, was a key part of the Showtime Lakers in the 1980s and a member of their back-to-back championship-winning squads in 1987 and 1988. It wouldn't be as big of a move for Klay to make from the Bay Area. It'd be a homecoming to the City of Angels, where he was born and where he went to high school.\n\nHappened to stumble upon this, too: Mychal talking about how Klay would fit with the Lakers, and his insistence that his son should go there to boot.\n\nYou can bet the 401k that former NBA sharpshooter and new Lakers head coach JJ Redick will be pounding the table for Klay. For an aging veteran who's perceived to be declining, what better environment is there for Klay to go to than the Lakers? He could pick up some tips from Redick -- who had to overcome innate athletic limitations (by NBA standards!) to extend/maximize his playing career -- and LeBron, who's the human embodiment of the Fountain of Youth.\n\nBoth LeBron and Klay have business decisions to make that, at the end of the day, are actually legacy decisions. It'd be such a cool inflection point to see the son of a Showtime Laker and second-greatest shooter to ever do it share the hardwood with the NBA's inaugural father-son duo. Many early indications point to this happening.\n\nCome on home, Klay. It'd be great for the league and for your place in history.

The Lakers' decision to draft him was not based on his age or limited experience last year at Southern Cal, but rather on a deeper understanding of his potential and legacy.\n\nBronny faced a significant health scare after suffering a cardiac arrest right after arriving at USC, which made many teams hesitant to draft him. However, after being declared fit by doctors, the Lakers took the chance on him, influenced partly by the presence of his father, LeBron James, a superstar player for the NBA storied franchise.\n\nThis move underscored the importance of legacy and last names in sports, as noted by Deiondra Sanders, the eldest daughter of NFL legend Deion Sanders. She highlighted this on social media, emphasizing how powerful family names can be in the sports world.\n\n\"Bronny got drafted by the Lakers,\" Deiondra wrote. \"I love to see it lol Y'all can't tell me Legacies and last names don't matter.\" She later posted a graphic on Instagram that said, \"Don't be madd at LeBron because you can't get your son on aat FedEx with you.\"\n\nESPN analyst Adrian Wojnarowski also weighed in, dismissing accusations of nepotism in Bronny's drafting. He pointed out that nepotism is prevalent across all levels of the NBA, from ownership to coaching, and Bronny's situation was no different. No different from the NFL with the Jones family controlling the Dallas Cowboys' front office.\n\nThe narrative of legacy and perceived nepotism is also relevant in the context of Shedeur Sanders, Deion Sanders' son, who is anticipated to be a top quarterback prospect in the 2025 NFL draft.\n\nUnlike Bronny, Shedeur has had a standout college career, but the shadow of his father's influence looms large. His brother, Shilo Sanders, faces a different path, with legal and health issues potentially affecting his draft prospects. However the drafting of James by the Lakers serves as a testament to the enduring influence of family legacies in sports, a phenomenon that is both celebrated and scrutinized.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nepotism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FedEx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4096,h_2304,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/buffs_beat/01j1gyrnyb6na4wa2wfm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

It looks like Lebron James might have some splainin' to do! The Lakers are keeping it all in the family with King James and his recently drafted son, Bronny, but his wife is the one who's a good sport. Savannah James shared her thoughts about claims that LeBron is sleeping with a new teammate's mother.\n\nAs BOSSIP reported, Lebron James Jr., aka Bronny, was picked 55th by the Los Angeles Lakers in this year's draft on June 27th. According to Complex, shortly after, Bartsool Sports' Steven Cheah took to X, formerly known as Twitter, with a damning and hilarious statement.\n\nIn the tweet, Cheah stated, \"It has been discovered that Lebron James is sleeping with his newest teammate's mom.\"\n\nSavannah James quickly responded online -- with laughing emojis! In case you missed it, Savannah is Bronny's mother. Her son also happens to be her husband's new teammate, making Cheah's joke pretty clever. In addition to being clever, the joke highlights a significant moment in basketball history. This marks the first time that a father and son have played in the NBA concurrently.\n\nLebron James' agent and longtime friend, Rich Paul, is standing ten toes behind the James empire. He recently spoke with TMZ about fans' reactions to Bronny being drafted by the Lakers. As expected, the sports agent is excited for Bronny and his new accomplishment. However, he has also heard the talks of nepotism being in the new Lakers player's favor, and he is shutting it down.\n\n\"He's got just as much to prove as anyone who was drafted Wednesday and Thursday,\" he stated. \"I don't think there's a lot of value to put in the name card. It's a lot more value to the work to be put in.\"\n\nAdele's boo also hinted at the fact that there are parents on every sports team that help their children achieve success.\n\nIn the case of the James family, he stated, \"If that's nepotism, then so be it.\"", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kerbi_lynn@bossip.com", "name": "Kerbi Lynn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uh_Oh!_(game_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uh Oh!

And that archetype will be wrapped around Bronny, and the other players that we get on to ways as we bring guys in and the young players we already have on our roster,\" Pelinka said. \"So I just think it's a perfect time as coach builds out his player development staff to really pour into the guys that we have here. And I think you guys will see that played out in real time once we get that staff hired.\"\n\nAccording to NBA insider Marc Stein, the Lakers have pursued former head coaches Dwane Casey and Jacque Vaughn to join Redick's coaching staff.\n\nLos Angeles Times' Dan Woike earlier reported on May 29 that the Lakers were also looking at former head coach Scott Brooks, Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell and Dallas Mavericks assistant Jared Dudley to fill Redick's staff.\n\nFollowing the Lakers' consecutive playoff exits at the hands of the 2023 NBA champion Denver Nuggets, they are now focused on surrounding LeBron James and Anthony Davis with two-way players.\n\nThey believe they have that in Bronny James.\n\n\"I think the road to ultimate victory in the NBA is with two-way players that you know can be great defenders and can be shotmakers on offense,\" Pelinka said. \"And if you're able to develop guys like that and surround your superstar players with them, that's a good recipe for success. And Bronny is of that ilk.\"\n\nPelinka described Bronny's trajectory as a point-of-attack defender, who can disrupt the opposing team's point guards.\n\n\"I think he can guard multiple positions,\" Pelinka said.\n\nWhile Bronny James has displayed dogged defense in his one-and-done season at USC and at the NBA Draft Combine, his shooting was suspect.\n\nHe only shot 26.7% from the 3-point range in 25 college games.\n\nHis outside shooting will be the swing skill that would define Bronny James' career in the NBA.\n\n\"We've really seen growth in his shooting,\" Pelinka said. \"I think at the [NBA Draft] Combine when we were there with the scouting staff, he was one of the leaders and sort of making his shots and some of the drills and we really think he can turn into being an elite shot maker. So just a three and D player for sure.\"\n\nPelinka attributed Bronny James' shooting struggles in college to his cardiac arrest last year that threw him off rhythm. He saw a similar pattern to Gabe Vincent's shooting struggles after a long layoff from a knee injury.\n\n\"We had a player on our roster this year -- Gabe Vincent who had to have surgery and missed some time and we saw him come back at the end of the season during the playoffs and he was really good defensively. But the offensive rhythm wasn't quite there,\" Pelinka said.\n\n\"And I remember as I was evaluating our team thinking that's similar to Bronny,\" he continued. \"I think he had a really strong defensive year at USC in terms of being that point of attack hound on the ball, but maybe because of the significant amount of time he took off the offensive flow wasn't it could be.\"\n\nPelinka believes the key is for the Lakers to polish Bronny James' shooting and get him back to his rhythm before the cardiac arrest.\n\n\"[That's] going to really catapult him back into getting the trajectory of being that development player that we really look forward to having,\" Pelinka said.\n\nWhat made him believe that it's achievable is Bronny James' \"extreme maturity.\"\n\n\"It's evident when you spend time with him that he doesn't let things bother him,\" Pelinka said. He is who he is. He believes in himself.\"\n\nA big part of that is because LeBron, who grew up without his father, made sure he was a present to Bronny. Pelinka shared the Lakers went home right away after winning the In-Season Tournament title instead of extending their stay in Las Vegas to celebrate for James to attend Bronny's USC debut.\n\n\"[Bronny] was raised right by LeBron and Savannah to be very respectful of coaches, in my case, a general manager but when he walks in the room, you have his attention because he was taught that and it's just very genuine and you can tell right away this is a fine young man that was raised the right way,\" Pelinka said.\n\nThe Lakers, Pelinka said, are prepared to insulate Bronny James from the narratives that have shaped since he declared for the NBA Draft -- that he's only drafted because of his father.\n\n\"The biggest moments in sports happen with the Lakers, and that's how we're built and we're excited to see this story unfold,\" Pelinka said.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name":

The 19-year-old will now join his dad, LeBron James, as part of the Lakers roster, which will be a historic feat in the NBA. This bizarre scenario prompted fans to dig up an old clip of Bronny, where he is mesmerized by the fact that his father played against the late, great Kobe Bryant.\n\nOver the years we have seen Bronny pay homage to the late veteran on several occasions, but it's refreshing to see that the newly recruited Lakers star was a Kobe fan since the very beginning.\n\nWhen Bronny was just four years old, he accompanied his father, who was a Cleveland Cavalier at the time, to a game against the LA Lakers. In the recently resurfaced clip, Bronny and LeBron can be seen having a conversation.\n\n\"Who was I playing against tonight?\" LeBron asked. The then four-year-old Bronny replied, \"The Lakers.\" After LeBron asked him again, \"Who was on the other team...What's his name?\" Bronny replied, \"Kobe.\"\n\nHowever, Bronny is not the only one in the James clan who is a lifelong fan of Kobe. Towards the end of the clip, LeBron can be heard telling Kobe after their game, \"I look up to you.\"\n\nMoreover, King James' youngest son Bryce is also a huge fan of the Mamba and is often seen wearing clothes with Kobe's face printed on them. When it comes to repping Kobe's name and legacy, Bronny isn't far behind either. The 19-year-old recently unveiled that he prefers wearing Kobe's shoes for games.\n\nDuring his conversation with Complex's Joe La Puma, he said, \"It's difficult. It's a lot to choose from...it's really like whatever I'm feeling that day. You know, Kyries, Kobes, Brons...really just like whatever I'm feeling that day I put them on.\"\n\nEven in the recent Draft Combine, Bronny was seen wearing the Kobe 4 Protro \"Philly.\" It's clear that the whole family holds the late legend in very high regard.\n\nFrom being a fan of Kobe to becoming part of the same family that he represented for two decades must be a surreal feeling for the 19-year-old. The Lakers recently announced that Bronny will wear the #9 jersey when he laces up for the franchise.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puma (brand)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/5eb84846-nba-2024-06-29t191921.758.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

That's when his Los Angeles Clippers traded for his son, Austin, meaning he'd be the first coach to ever coach his son in the league, doing so until 2018.\n\nNext season, the league is preparing to see another father-son duo. The Lakers selected Bronny James in the 2024 NBA Draft earlier this week, setting the table for him to join LeBron in Los Angeles this coming season. When they take the court together, it would mark the first time a father and son play in the same NBA game.\n\nBronny James' NBA journey will start in the Summer League next month, and it could draw big viewership numbers, according to the Sports Business Journal. While speaking with SBJ, Doc Rivers pointed out the amount of pressure James will face in the league as he goes against his father, particularly on social media.\n\n\"Unfortunately for Bronny, he's going to be under an incredible microscope, and at a time where - I always call 'em the cowards of Twitter and Instagram - people can make comments without showing their faces,\" Rivers said. \"And usually, those comments aren't very nice. And it's too bad, because the kid seems like he's a terrific kid and doesn't deserve any of the negative stuff.\"\n\nThe expectation was the Lakers would take Bronny James with the No. 55 overall pick, and his agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group reportedly told other teams not to take him before that point in the draft. Now that he's on his way to Los Angeles, the next step will be Summer League.\n\nBut Rivers said the noise won't stop there. It'll continue through the start of the season, and that'll add to the attention James receives during his rookie campaign.\n\n\"[Bronny's] G league games will be packed early on, for sure,\" Rivers said. \"And if he plays well, then he'll end up playing on the big league [Lakers]. It'll be a story that keeps coming up, because there's different benchmarks. Summer League, that's going to be a story - how well is he playing in that?\n\n\"Training camp, there's another story because now LeBron's in training camp with his son. [At the] beginning of the year, is he going to play on the G League team? That's going to be a story. Or if he's not on the G league team and on the big team, that's a story.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_schultz@on3.com", "name": "Nick Schultz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_City_Business_Journals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American City Business Journals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klutch_Sports_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klutch Sports Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/06/29140751/lebron_bronny-james.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

By selecting Bronny James with the 55th pick, they also strengthened their chances of retaining his father, LeBron James, with the team.

With a lot of optimism, the veteran concluded, \"I'm just gonna take the bet. This kid works hard, he has LeBron James' DNA, and I'm gonna take the bet on that.\"\n\nBronny is not as elite as LeBron was when he joined the NBA. However, Draymond, along with others, sees him making his own identity in the future with his unique playing style despite having the star surname attached to him.\n\nA majority of NBA enthusiasts anticipated Bronny's selection to the Lakers because of many factors working behind it.\n\nLeBron James might not be involved in his eldest son Bronny's draft, but his agent Rich Paul allegedly played a huge role.\n\nFormer Warriors executive Bob Myers disclosed how Paul manipulated the other teams so they didn't pick Bronny. According to Myers, \"Rich Paul is calling teams; don't take Bronny James. He's telling them, don't take him. If you take him, he's going to Australia. So he has a plan, and he has a place.\"\n\nPaul's strategy finally worked, as the other franchises withdrew their potential interest in the former USC guard while the Lakers acquired him.\n\nNow that Bronny's spot is confirmed, everyone eagerly awaits LeBron's decision about his future.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Myers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Myers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Draymond-Green-and-Bronny-James-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

The star averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game on 54 percent shooting from the floor this season for the Lakers. The franchise has done everything they can to satisfy the forward ahead of his pending free-agency by hiring his podcast partner as head coach and drafting his son with the 55th overall pick.\n\nAs James reaches 40 years old next season, the forward seemingly wants to play at most three more years in the NBA. Considering this, it's possible that this upcoming contract could be the last major deal that the star signs in his storied career.\n\nIf the Lakers want to unlock the mid-level exception, L.A. will likely need James to take $10 million less annually. The \"team salary\" needs to stay in the range of $160 million total.\n\nIt should also be noted that the franchise has a tradeable salary with D'Angelo Russell accepting his player option for next season. Additionally, L.A. has two first-round picks (2029 and 2031) and three first-round swaps (2026,2028 and 2030) they can offer in trades this offseason.\n\nLeBron could help Lakers with team-friendly approach to new contract\n\nConsidering the amount of assets that L.A. has this offseason, the franchise has a clear path towards championship contention if they can make the right moves. This likely includes not trading Austin Reaves or Rui Hachimura and upgrading the starting guard spot opposite Reaves. Additionally, L.A. will need to acquire front-court veterans who can play solid reserve minutes.\n\nThe only major problem with fixing these holes is that general manager Rob Pelinka will be making these decisions. Pelinka has made very poor personal decisions and will likely need to do better if the franchise wants any hope of making this roster a championship contender in a tough western conference.\n\nWith that they have, the squad should target wings like De'Anthony Melton, and Derrick Jones Jr. in free agency. Additionally, they could see the trade availability of the Trail Blazers' Malcolm Brogdon.

The Lakers star found out the hard way during a recent trip to New York.\n\nIn a video posted on June 27, just hours before it was announced that Bronny James would be joining his father as the newest Los Angeles Laker draftee, a disgruntled fan aired out LeBron James location after being denied a photo with the NBA star.\n\nJames was spotted at a restaurant in New York City. Apparently, the fan was shut down by security as he approached him and asked for a photograph. In retaliation, the fan recorded a video and encouraged other fans to \"pull up.\"\n\n\"Yo, Bron dubbed my picture,\" the fan said. \"I'm about to make his sh -- dumb hot.\"\n\n\"Everybody, pull up. That n -- ga having lunch right here,\" the fan said before showing the restaurant where James was dining. According to the post, the restaurant was Au Cheval in Lower Manhattan.\n\n\"If y'all want a picture with LeBron, everybody pull up here right here... Right now. He eating lunch with Dwyane Wade,\" the man said before the video concluded.\n\nJames was not seen in the video. However, the fan showed multiple vehicles believed to be those of James and his entourage.\n\nUpon the video going viral, other fans condemned the man for sharing the NBA star's location.\n\nA grown man did all of this over a picture,\" a social media user stated.\n\n\"The f -- ing entitlement of you ppl,\" said another fan. \"This is why famous ppl hate y'all so much and don't even wanna interact with y'all no more. y'all don't know boundaries and think because you see them on tv or listen to their music that they OWE you attention. they don't owe you S -- T.\"\n\nWeird behavior bruh,\" a fan bluntly noted.\n\nIt is unclear whether James was actually inside the restaurant at the time, as the video did not provide any visual confirmation. James lives in Los Angeles, but he may have traveled to New York for the 2024 NBA draft. The annual event took place in Brooklyn on June 26 and 27. James' eldest son, Bronny, was drafted by the Lakers on June 27.

LeBron's eldest son played only one season in college and had an underwhelming freshman campaign for USC. Despite that, he declared for the Draft and was picked 55th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nNow, Bronny and LeBron are the first father-and-son tandem to play together on the same NBA team. But before that could happen, the critics were all over Bronny and Bron.\n\nAccording to Los Angeles Lakers Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, everybody should get the microscope off Bronny and give the kid a chance to prove himself.\n\n\"I would like to get the scrutiny off Bronny James,\" said O'Neal during the recent episode of The Big Podcast. \"Yeah, my nephew. He's a kid, a great kid; all he wants to do is play. It's unfortunate for kids like ours; they have to live up to what we have done.\"\n\nShaq knows what LeBron and Bronny feel right now.\n\nShaq can relate to LeBron and Bronny a lot. That's because O'Neal's eldest son Shareef also had a heart issue before he made his collegiate debut. Shareef also underwent surgery and was medically redshirted during his first year at UCLA. He played one season for UCLA and two for LSU, posting career averages of 2.6 points and 3.0 rebounds per game.\n\nO'Neal also has a second son, Shaqir, who plays forward for Texas Southern. In two seasons played so far, he has averaged 1.5 points and 1.3 rebounds per game. Although Shaqir still has two collegiate seasons left, he will end up like Shareef, who never came close to how good Shaq was at LSU. Despite that, Daddy Diesel says he doesn't put pressure on his kids.\n\n\"I tell my kids all the time pressure's where you don't know where your next meal is coming from,\" added Shaq. \"You don't have to be like me. I want you to be better than me, and I'm not talking about you as a player or as a person. You know, look at me and learn from all my mistakes and make sure you don't go through the same things I go through.\" added Shaq.\n\nShareef went undrafted in 2022\n\nShareef declared for the 2022 NBA Draft but was left unselected. He played in the 2022 Summer League for the Lakers but didn't get a roster spot. He played for the G League Ignite team during the 2022-23 campaign, averaging 2.3 PPG and 3.2 RPG in 5.5 minutes per game.\n\nMeanwhile, Bronny was actually drafted by the Lakers, even if it was with the next-to-last pick of the 2024 NBA Draft. LeBron Jr. is expected to play for the Lakers Summer League team, but it remains to be seen if he can crack one of the final roster spots on the main Purple and Gold team.\n\nIt's wild how Bronny is getting criticized for chasing his NBA dream. Shaq said that he hopes Bronny gets his chance to play and the opportunity to make a name for himself. Those are going to be difficult. But he's worked so hard to get this close to his dream and just quit because of his jealous haters.\n\nRelated: \"The NBA is full of nepotism...

And, for two of the main people involved, it's not very fair.\n\nThus a wet blanket should be tossed over the Lakers' engineering of the most celebrated 55th overall pick in NBA Draft history.\n\nYeah, they did it, of course they did it, they drafted an untested 19-year-old kid named Bronny James Thursday to unite him with his father LeBron in becoming the NBA's first father-son duo.\n\nThey did it even though Bronny was ignored by virtually every other NBA team with a chance to draft him.\n\nThey did it even though Bronny struggled last season for Southern Cal in his return from a cardiac arrest episode that cost him five months.\n\nThey did it even though most experts agreed that his game -- 5 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists per appearance for the Trojans -- could have used at least another year of college tutoring.\n\nThey did it seemingly for the reason they do a lot of things -- to keep their superstar happy. LeBron had professed a desire to play with his son, LeBron can opt out of his contract this summer, they probably figured LeBron needed to be kept satisfied at all costs.\n\nBut this is seemingly a high price to pay.\n\nGranted, the greatest fee will not come from the Lakers, who, let's face it, weren't going to get a star with the 55th pick anyway. This was a nolose selection that, personnel-wise, cost them nothing.\n\nThe steepest cost will also not be affixed to LeBron, who will get to make history and play with his son and where's the downside in that?\n\nNo, the highest price here will be exacted from, sadly, Bronny himself.\n\nAll the poetic waxing by commentators about the beauty of a father-son pairing failed to look at it from what could be the son's point of view.\n\nDoes Bronny really need this kind of pressure? Is it really fair to ask him to develop his game while sitting on the same bench as arguably the greatest player in history who also happens to be his father?\n\nCritics will cry, \"Nepotism\" with every dribble. Experts will examine his father's reaction with every shot. It was tough enough for Bronny to play college games with his father attracting all the attention while sitting courtside. Can you imagine the heat he will feel with his father wearing the same uniform and hanging out in a nearby locker?\n\nThere will be the one shining moment when they initially take the court together in a regular-season game, probably a blowout where Bronny will enter in the final minutes and LeBron will throw him a pass for an ally-oop dunk and history will be made and everyone will weep.\n\nBut aside from that photo op, how can playing with his father feel like anything to Bronny other than constant controlled chaos?\n\nRare will be the interview where he's not asked about his father. Even rarer will be the accomplishment that isn't judged in relation to his father.\n\nLate second-round draft picks are seldom seen and infrequently heard. But because of his proximity to his father, everything Bronny does will be videoed and everything he utters will go viral.\n\nThis would be one thing if he was a top draft pick and had the game to endure the scrutiny. But he was the fourth-from-the-last pick in the draft who will essentially still be in basketball school.\n\nHe just won't be learning on the job. He will be learning on the fire.\n\nEven if Bronny spends much of his time with the minor-league\n\nSouth Bay Lakers, the circus will follow him there. Having bravely overcome a frightening medical challenge, this young man deserves a chance to regain his footing on his own time, in his own space. Instead, he has now been stuck under the brightest of lights amid the most aggressive of timetables, obstacle upon obstacle, and how fair is that?\n\nBy all accounts, Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka means well.\n\nHe believes in the legacy of the Lakers greatness, and believes this draft pick supports that.\n\n\"That feels like something that can be magical,\" Pelinka told reporters Thursday. \"NBA history should be made in a Laker uniform.\"\n\nAs for Bronny and the sweltering spotlight, Pelinka believes the kid can handle it, noting, \"Growing up as he's grown up, there's a fish bowl, lots of eyes looking at everything you do, he's been able to handle all of that with an extreme maturity.\"\n\nMore than anything, it seems obvious Pelinka believes he needs to keep LeBron in a Laker uniform, and he's betting this pick will ensure that.\n\nIt's a safe bet, but a greatly unsettling bet.\n\nBronny is coming.

The 4-time champion was allegedly savoring his lunch with former teammate and close friend Dwyane Wade in New York City. During this time, a fan approached for a picture with the 39-year-old, but he was turned down. What the angry fan did next, shook the internet.\n\nFrustrated with the rejection, the fan filmed a video disclosing the location of LeBron. He stated in the clip, \"Yo LeBron dumped my picture so I'm about to make his sh*t dumb hot! Everybody pull up, he's having lunch right here. Everybody pull up to Au Cheval, he's sitting right there. His security dumped my sh*t. But if anybody wants a picture with LeBron, pull up right here he's eating lunch with Dwyane Wade.\"\n\nIf there was any truth behind his claim and some fans would have taken it seriously, then LeBron might have had security concerns, but as of the time of writing, no such report has emerged. The incident happened hours before the 2024 NBA Draft night two, the big day for LeBron as he was waiting to hear his son Bronny's name called out.\n\nLeBron James was eagerly waiting for Bronny to start his NBA journey so that they could share the same stage. But little did he know that they would soon share the same locker room. Yes, the 19-year-old point guard got selected by the LA Lakers as the 55th pick and the father couldn't hold himself back from sharing a special post on Instagram.\n\nJust like he shared a message with Bronny before the draft, LeBron shared a series of pictures, including Bronny's childhood picture and with both of them in the Lakers' jersey, LeBron wrote \"Legacy\" in the caption.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Dave McMenamin, some members of the James family along with Bronny's friends gathered to celebrate his big news. The Insider stated, \"After the Lakers delivered their decision, LeBron led the group in a champagne toast to commemorate the occasion, a source told ESPN, and was 'very emotional' considering the weight of the moment.\"\n\nBronny's draft was indeed an emotional moment for his close ones.

At No. 55 in the second round of the NBA draft, Bronny and his father LeBron James made history. They are now the first father-and-son duo ever in the NBA. Of course, with this development comes scrutiny and discourse. Not to mention, with this development comes major expectations. It's expected that this be the case and some of it I would say is warranted. After all, we're talking about the son of one of the GOATs of the game.\n\nThere hasn't been a player to have started their career early enough and played long enough for this to have been possible before. Sure, you have many sons of former NBA players playing in the league today. The likes of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Tim Hardaway Jr. have call carved out names for themselves in the association. However, all of their parents' careers were long gone for them to ever team up. So, once again, LeBron is in a unique position, but what else is new? It seems now the public is critical of LeBron being a conduit to Bronny's success. But I think that sentiment is misguided.\n\nSure, Bronny is the beneficiary of what Katt Williams would call a \"hookup.\" But we can't act like Bronny just rolled out of bed and got drafted. He's been working toward this moment for years. He genuinely wanted this. Bronny was so determined, that he continued his pursuit after suffering cardiac arrest last year. The idea that Bronny was simply gifted this opportunity? I just can't get with that.\n\nWhen you look at examples like JJ Reddick becoming the Lakers' latest head coach, you can see nepotism at play. Oftentimes, nepotism takes on such a negative connotation. However, at one point or another, we've all benefitted from it. JJ Reddick has cultivated a relationship with LeBron, and they seem to interact rather well together. I have no doubts that the rapport they have built aided in Reddick landing his new role. To be fair, some were critical of that as well, but it hasn't been the groundswell we've seen regarding Bronny.\n\nI maintain that Bronny has earned the right to play in the NBA if deemed good enough. It's not like Bronny took away a prime draft spot from a prospect. He was drafted in the second round for Christ's sake. If anything, Bronny has a great opportunity to grow his game a lot more than he would've at USC. Lastly, as Black culture, let's embrace seeing more of these opportunities being made available for our children. These examples need to be more prevalent and normalized. Ultimately, this should be celebrated as a blessing. Too many times negative news rules our timelines.

Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports / Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLeBron James has received praise and criticism for the Los Angeles Lakers drafting his son Bronny in the second round Thursday.\n\nHe's also drawn humor.\n\nAnd comedian Canice Nnanna may have had the best skit of all. Many are congratulating James because he is simply celebrating the opportunity to play alongside his son. A father-son duo has never teamed up in NBA history.\n\nThe critics are upset because it appears James and agent Rich Paul forced the Lakers into drafting Bronny. After a below average freshman season at USC, he was chosen ahead of more established players.\n\nEnter Nnanna, who decided to lighten the mood by saying LeBron has accomplished something no other player has done.\n\n\"Black Facts,\" Nnanna opened. \"LeBron James is the first player to play with his stepdad, his real dad, and his real son all in front of Kendrick Lamar's son.\n\nThe comedian found a way to take a jab at every step of LeBron's career. In Cleveland, his \"stepdad\" was Delonte West because there were Internet rumors of West having a realationship with James' mother. The \"real dad\" is Greg Oden, who played with James for one season with the Miami Heat. Many have said Oden and James are nearly identical. The \"real son\" is Bronny, of course, with the Lakers.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Nnanna took a final shot at rapper Drake by calling him \"Kendrick Lamar's son\" after losing their recent rap battle.\n\nShandel Richardson is the publisher of Inside The Heat.

Even as it would have paid him $51,415,938 and made him an unrestricted agent after the 2024-25 season, he clearly felt negotiating a new deal would be to his best interests. Under the new collective bargaining agreement and on the willingness of the Lakers to grant him the maximum-allowable salary, he stands to earn a whopping $162 million through 2027. The numbers are unprecedented for a player about to turn 40, and who has -- if slowly -- been regressing.\n\nTo be sure, James' value extends off the court, and the Lakers have historically taken care of the names on their marquee. In this context, his salary stands to be a bargain. There is likewise his eligibility to include a no-trade clause in his new accord to consider. Given recent pronouncements, however, he is evidently keen on using the opportunity to provide the purple and gold with not insignificant elbow room to latch on to desirable free agents. Per agent Rich Paul, he's willing to take a pay cut in order to free up the $12.9 million midlevel exception for an \"impact player.\"\n\nIn other words, James is putting his money where his mouth is. For all his accomplishments, he has continued to cast moist eyes on the ultimate prize. In fact, it can be argued that he remains bent on pushing his limits despite his advancing age and recent susceptibility to injury in search of a fifth championship. With the Lakers' roster already at 14 following the additions of draftees Dalton Kinect and Bronny James, the final arrival needs to be consequential if they are to keep pace with the National Basketball Association's acknowledged elite.\n\nWhether or not the likes of Klay Thompson, DeMar DeRozan, and Jonas Valanciunas are truly available remains to be seen. In any case, it's clear that James understands he and the Lakers are at a crosswords. Only if they work together will they be able to overcome the significant challenges before them. Which is why they will be busy in the runup to the season opener in October. They know full well that their capacity to meet their immediate objective will effectively inform their future.\n\nAnthony L.

We are extremely proud of you and continue to bring the energy.\"\n\nTexas Southern's official X account also celebrated the achievement, posting, \"Congratulations to former @TSUMensHoops @TexasSouthern star Joirdon Karl Nicholas - proof you can achieve your dream with hard work!\"\n\nNicholas's journey to this point has been nothing short of remarkable. The Houston native began his collegiate career at Stephen F. Austin before transferring to Texas Southern, where he made an immediate impact. Over three seasons from 2021 to 2023, Nicholas helped lead the Tigers to three consecutive SWAC tournament championships.\n\nHis performance on the court was consistently impressive. In 88 games with the Tigers, Nicholas averaged 10.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game while shooting 54% from the field. His standout season came in 2023 when he was named to the All-SWAC Second Team after averaging 10.7 points and a conference-leading 8.9 rebounds per game.\n\nBut it was during the 2021 SWAC tournament that Nicholas truly shined. In three tournament games, he averaged 18 points on an incredible 69% shooting, pulled down 10.7 rebounds, and added 1.7 blocks per game. His efforts earned him a spot on the All-SWAC Tournament team and secured the championship for Texas Southern.\n\nThis past season, Nicholas transitioned to the NBA G-League as a member of the South Bay Lakers, the minor league affiliate of the Los Angeles Lakers. In 26 games, including 14 starts, he averaged 7.9 points and 6.0 rebounds per game while shooting 50% from the field. His 19.7 minutes per game provided him with invaluable experience and exposure.\n\nNow, Nicholas has been given an even greater opportunity. The Los Angeles Lakers have announced him as a member of their 2024 NBA Summer League team. He will join a roster that includes high-profile players like Bronny James, the son of NBA legend LeBron James, and Tennessee sharpshooter Dalton Knecht.\n\nThe Lakers will start their summer league schedule by facing the Houston Rockets' summer league team on Friday, July 12th, at 7:30 PM EST.

When he was still a member of the Boston Celtics, they clashed with LeBron thrice in four postseasons but failed to beat his Cleveland Cavaliers each time.\n\nSmart witnessed arguably the best version of LeBron in 2018 when the superstar forward single-handedly led the Cavs to their fourth-straight Finals appearance. But despite this, he still thinks the Miami Heat's LeBron was an even better player.\n\n\"Imma go '12. '18 didn't do him no justice. I don't mean that against him, but it's just that he didn't had a squad,\" Smart said in his appearance on the Run Your Race podcast. \"You know what I'm saying? He didn't really, and at that time, everybody's expecting him without the squad even though he didn't have [a chance] to steal. That's why.\"\n\n2012 vs. 2018 LeBron\n\nThe 2012 James had no flaws in his game. At age 27, he enjoyed the pinnacle of his physical state and could do it all -- The King was engaged on both ends of the floor, scoring, playmaking, rebounding, and defending. Once he received the ball in transition, there was nothing opposing teams could do as LBJ was always running at full steam with his immense power and motor.\n\nThat said, the 2018 version is arguably LeBron's offensive apex. Although his athleticism slightly dropped, he was much more mature and wiser in his decision-making. The then-Cavs superstar fully embraced the leadership role and already had tons of basketball experience. At that time, he was also a great three-point shooter who could hurt his opponents from anywhere on the floor.\n\nPlaying alongside Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and some great role players, LeBron had a great supporting cast that helped him win his first championship in 2012. But in 2018, he was carrying the Cleveland squad on his own, which was even more impressive in Smart's eyes.\n\nTwo of Bron's best versions\n\nRegardless of the comparisons, 2012 and 2018 were the best individual years LeBron ever had, which is a testament to his unmatched longevity and sustained basketball excellence. Most all-time greats have enjoyed a single prime throughout their career, but LeBron has separated himself by being consistently great since entering the NBA in 2003.\n\nJames is still great, having averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, 7.3 assists, and a career-best 41.0% from the three-point line in the 2023-24 season for the Los Angeles Lakers. He's not the defender he used to be, but regardless, The King continues to showcase unprecedented greatness, especially for a guy his age.\n\nRelated: How 16-year-old LeBron James was protecting himself from autograph fraud: \"That's so somebody can't forge it\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrei_de_guzman@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrei De Guzman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

During an episode of Podcast P, presented by Wave Sports + Entertainment, Paul George made it known that he believes Bronny has NBA potential.\n\n\"I'm a fan of Bronny,\" George said. \"I think he has NBA potential for sure.\"\n\nThat's exactly the topic that most discussions around Bronny focus on -- whether or not he can keep up with NBA talent. Besides his age (Bronny is just 19 years old), James only spent a year in college before deciding to commit to the draft. His stats with USC basketball weren't mind-blowing as well, which led to plenty of skepticism from critics.\n\nRegardless, it looks like the 6-foot-2 guard showed a bit of upside during this year's Draft Combine. Bronny garnered attention with his 40 and a half inch vertical leap, in addition to a 19-of-25 performance during the three-point shooting drill. He was also measured with a 6'7 wingspan, which will definitely be helpful defensively considering his lack of size.\n\nDefense could be the difference maker for Bronny\n\nWhile his performance in the combine scrimmage wasn't too impressive, Bronny's athleticism could be the key to a successful adjustment in the pros. And it helps that his goals are somewhat realistic. If one were to be blunt, Bronny is no superstar like his father, and he knows that. It's exactly why he mentioned a couple of interesting names when he was asked which players he models his game after: Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, and Davion Mitchell.\n\nAll three are defensive specialists who can also contribute on the offensive end when needed. They don't need to take 20 shot attempts to be effective on the floor; they know their role, and they embrace it wholeheartedly. They aren't the largest on the court either. Holiday, White and Mitchell are all below 6'5, yet they play bigger than their size because of sheer effort.\n\nCan Bronny somehow develop into that kind of player? As mentioned, he has the athleticism to guard taller and faster players. Secondly, the commitment to become such a prototype is also present. However, there are still lots of aspects to Bronny's game that need development. His shooting efficiency could use more consistency. He has to handle the ball better for JJ Redick to give him reps at the one. For now, he might be a utility guy, scoring in transition and playing off the ball during half-court sets.\n\nAll things considered, only time will tell if Bronny James can develop from a raw prospect to a high-quality rotational piece. Still, if a star like Paul George can see potential in the youngster, then the possibility of it happening shouldn't be ruled out.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_buyawe@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brian Buyawe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vertical jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Paul-George-gets-100-real-on-Bronny-James-potential.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692325", "eventUri": "eng-9692325", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 88, "relevance": 1}

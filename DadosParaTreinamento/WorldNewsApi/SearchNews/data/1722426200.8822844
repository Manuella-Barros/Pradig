{"id": 243311184, "title": "Hidden Midlands village is among most unspoilt in the country", "text": "The idyllic charm of living in the heart of the Cotswolds does come with a few drawbacks, one of them being the constant influx of tourists. Well-known spots like Castle Combe and Bourton-on-the-Water can be swamped by visitors during peak holiday seasons, potentially causing discontent amongst natives. The Telegraph previously curated a list of 30 noteworthy villages across the country that have primarily been spared from mass tourism. In their words: \"Fortunately there are still plenty of beautiful but uncrowded British villages that do retain their authentic character, where medieval pubs and churches remain the beating heart of the community, and where welcoming shopkeepers stock treats from local producers.\" Featured on this list is Ombersley, a beautiful hidden treasure just under an hour's drive from birmingham -city-centre>Birmingham city centre. Let's examine what life looks like in one of Britain's most pristine villages.

It added: \"It's a backwater literally, the River Severn meanders nearby in the pastoral no-man's land between the Cotswolds, the Malverns and the Shropshire Hills.\", reports Birmingham Live. \"But while it may not be designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, this pocket of Worcestershire is certainly pretty and Ombersley is its best-looking village.\" \"It's a sleepy corner of black-and-white, wattle-and-daub buildings, listed and leaning, including various ancient inns (medieval King's Arms is an old-school pub; Georgian coaching inn Crown and Sandys has local ales on tap) and Tudor cottages and houses which, this being Worcestershire, are very much lived-in.\" The Telegraph added: \"A handsome Gothic Revival redbrick, Checketts country deli is a relative newcomer to the village it opened in 1902 where you can buy quality produce from the surrounding farms and orchards. A stroll down the lane brings you to Holt Fleet on the River Severn, and a pub of the same name serving drinks on the lawn overlooking the water.\" Places to eat and shop. Anyone visiting Ombersley has a good selection of shops, restaurants and pubs to choose from. The medieval King's Arms is a country pub that's one of the most popular spots for a pint or two in the village. One glowing review for the pub said: \"The quintessential pub experience must surely include a picturesque, genuinely historical building; good tasty food and an outstanding warm and friendly service - well tick, tick, and tick for The Kings Arms! \". Then there's Checketts country deli, which is the place to go for anyone who fancies a locally-produced pizza or purchase a range of delicacies. One recent visitor wrote: \"We've been to Checketts numerous times over the past month and it is truly a hidden gem! \". \"Customer service is always on point, and the food is equally fantastic.

To make matters worse, Haynes had previously told the site that Phoenix was responsible for the film's momentum -- its financing was strongly dependent on his casting, as the film is likely to be rated NC-17.\n\nHaynes was determined to include explicit sex scenes, but told the site that Phoenix encouraged him to push even further. He praised Phoenix's \"desire to push through barriers and to really get into the uncomfortable places about this relationship,\" adding, \"The whole experience was prompted by Joaquin.\" But something clearly changed for the actor.\n\nWhatever Phoenix's reasoning for pulling out of the film, which would have been his first gay role on screen, several people involved have been left without jobs because of his timing.

Production was set to start on Haynes' next film within days, but Phoenix has suddenly dropped out of the Mexico shoot and now the production is halted with no immediate plans to continue.\n\nPer IndieWire, Phoenix has pulled out of Haynes' untitled gay romance detective drama a mere five days before shooting was set to begin. Filming was expected to start in Guadalajara, Mexico, but the actor exited the project while still in Los Angeles. Making things more interesting, Phoenix actually co-wrote the film and developed it alongside Haynes and Jon Raymond. The project was said to be pushing the boundaries of an NC-17 rating for the detective period piece, which is set in the 1930s.\n\nThe Project Hinged on Joaquin Phoenix's Involvement\n\nComplicating matters is that Phoenix's name was crucial to the film being financed. The project was enticing when sales began ahead of the European Film Market back in February, but things began to go south in early July. According to Haynes, while he was promoting his last film May December in 2023, Phoenix was the one who wanted to push the film's explicit content further and further, and it all seemed driven by his involvement. A reason for the actor dropping out has not been given, but it has made the production financially responsible for everyone involved. This means people who planned on working on the film still need to be paid.\n\n2:00 Related 12 Best Joaquin Phoenix Performances\n\nA look at the career of one of Hollywood's most versatile actors, Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nJust because Phoenix has exited, doesn't mean the financiers and crew have to work without compensation. MK2 Films, which backed the project, has no plans to replace Phoenix at this time and the primary focus is taking care of all the necessary parties financially. Danny Ramirez, who will be seen in Captain America: Brave New World next year, was cast in July as Phoenix's romantic co-lead before shooting was set to begin, likely turning down other jobs to appear in the film. Anyone involved in the project that dedicated their time and money to it will likely see something in return, but that doesn't make the situation any less stressful.\n\nAs for what's next, Phoenix will be seen in Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux, hitting screens on Oct. 4, and he recently wrapped production on Ari Aster's Eddington back in May. Haynes is expected to turn his attention to directing the limited series, Trust, which will reunite him with writing partner Jon Raymond and star, Kate Winslet, who also worked with the director in Mildred Pierce.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Haynes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Todd Haynes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IndieWire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guadalajara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guadalajara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Raymond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Raymond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_International_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin International Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Aster", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ari Aster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mildred Pierce (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brave New World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Winslet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Winslet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joaquin-phoenix-in-napoleon-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805222", "eventUri": "eng-9805222", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-04", "textStart": 2421, "textEnd": 2427}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

A source close to the production told Variety Phoenix got \"cold feet.\" Producers apparently tried to keep the film alive, but it seems that investors had agreed to finance the film based on Phoenix's Oscar-winning star power. No Phoenix, no movie, so the entire project is reportedly dead in the water.\n\nWhat makes this story all the more puzzling is that Phoenix was supposedly the driving force behind this film in the first place. Last year, Haynes described the project as \"an original script that I developed with Joaquin Phoenix based on some thoughts and ideas he brought to me. We basically wrote with him as a story writer. Me and Jon Raymond and Joaquin share the story credit. And we hope to be shooting it beginning early next year. It's a gay love story set in 1930s LA.\" Per Deadline, \"this film had its fair share of dicey intimacy scenes\" -- but Phoenix was the one advocating for more explicit scenes between the two male leads in the first place: \"Joaquin was pushing me further and going 'no, let's go further,'\" Haynes told IndieWire. \"This will be an NC-17 film.\"\n\nIn short: \"The whole experience was prompted by Joaquin,\" Haynes said to IndieWire 2023. \"It was prompted by his daring, his desire to push through barriers and to really get into the uncomfortable places about this relationship. And yet it felt like a very organic process.\"\n\nWhat in the world could've made Phoenix back out at the last minute of a project that was his idea in the first place? Barring a personal emergency, the most likely answer is usually \"creative differences\" -- though having collaborated with Haynes all the way up to the point of beginning filming, it would have to be a pretty big falling out to tank the whole film. Sources for IndieWire said that \"multiple stakeholders on the Haynes project -- from financiers to crew -- still need to be compensated,\" and the current \"focus is on cutting checks for the people who invested their time in the project.\" Haynes will reportedly turn his attention to Trust, his upcoming HBO series with Kate Winslet, instead. Phoenix will soon be on the promotional circuit for Joker 2.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Phoenix was already on location at the time.\n\nHaynes assembled a crew in Mexico for the untitled film backed by sales agent MK2 Films. Sales in territories worldwide began ahead of the European Film Market in February. The project fell apart in early July.\n\nSources said financing hinged on Phoenix's casting in a likely NC-17-rated period piece set in the 1930s. \"Joaquin was pushing me further and going 'No, let's go further,'\" he said. \"This will be an NC-17 film,\" Haynes told IndieWire last year at Cannes.\n\nDuring his press tour for Haynes' 2023 Netflix film \"May December, the director told IndieWire that Phoenix was the film's driving force.\n\n\"The whole experience was prompted by Joaquin,\" he said. \"It was prompted by his daring, his desire to push through barriers and to really get into the uncomfortable places about this relationship. And yet it felt like a very organic process.\"\n\nIndieWire has reached out to reps for Joaquin Phoenix and Killer Films. Reps for Killer Films had no comment at this time.\n\nHaynes has been clear about wanting the film to be as graphic as possible in terms of its gay sex scenes. The untitled film would have marked Phoenix's first gay onscreen role.\n\nAn actor pulling out of a movie five days before shooting leaves a lot of people on the hook. According to an inside source with knowledge of the film's finances, multiple stakeholders on the Haynes project -- from financiers to crew -- still need to be compensated. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" star Danny Ramirez joined the cast in July as Phoenix's love interest, right before shooting was set to begin.\n\nChristine Vachon and Pamela Koffler's Killer Films has produced all of Haynes' movies. Phoenix is not expected to return to the project, according to IndieWire's sources, and Killer Films is not yet looking to replace him. For now, the focus is on cutting checks for the people who invested their time in the project.\n\nIndieWire also hears that Haynes will now focus on directing the limited series \"Trust,\" an adaptation of Hernan Diaz's novel about upper-class financial ruin in the 20th century, with his \"Mildred Pierce\" star Kate Winslet and also at HBO. Haynes will write the series with Jon Raymond.\n\nPhoenix most recently starred in Ari Aster's Western comedy \"Eddington.\" Shot in New Mexico, it wrapped in May.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com",

According to IndieWire, Phoenix dropped out of the project in July, and since then the film has been put on hold. To make matters worse, Haynes had previously told the site that Phoenix was responsible for the film's momentum -- its financing was strongly dependent on his casting, as the film is likely to be rated NC-17.\n\nHaynes was determined to include explicit sex scenes, but told the site that Phoenix encouraged him to push even further.

IndieWire was the first to report the news.\n\nPhoenix, who will be seen on screen this year in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was set to star in the lead role of the movie, described as an explicit gay romance set in 1930s Los Angeles and Mexico. Danny Ramirez of Top Gun: Maverick and Captain America: Brave New World had been cast in a supporting role. Based on Haynes' previous comments to the press, the story revolved around a corrupt L.A. cop and a Native American who are forced to flee Los Angeles for Mexico.\n\nPre-production began months ago. Crews were hired in Mexico, including Guadalajara, with more flying in to work on the three-month project. Then, around the time of San Diego Comic-Con in late July, Phoenix walked away without warning. There are currently no plans to recast the role, which means the project is indefinitely in limbo and the hired workers are stuck in a dicey situation as everyone figures out how they will be paid.\n\nWant more movie news?

It's a project Phoenix brought to Haynes about two years ago, and they've been developing it together ever since. Jon Raymond, who co-wrote Haynes' HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce, worked on the script with both the director and Phoenix. MK2 Films served as the international sales agent out of France, though EW has learned financing for the movie was very much dependent on Phoenix's involvement.\n\nThis film would have marked Phoenix's first gay role on screen. Haynes was open about making the sex scenes as explicit as possible. \"Joaquin was pushing me further and going, 'No, let's go further,'\" the filmmaker told IndieWire in May 2023. \"This will be an NC-17 film.\" He then told the same outlet later last year, \"The whole experience was prompted by Joaquin. It was prompted by his daring, his desire to push through barriers and to really get into the uncomfortable places about this relationship.

The project took a lot of time, especially from Phoenix himself, who had developed the screenplay for the detective love story with Haynes and Jon Raymond.\n\nNow, the Joker actor has \"cold feet\" and made the hast choice to exit the film. The reason is still up in the air, but the nature and content within the film could be a reason. The new movie from filmmaker Todd Haynes would've been rated NC-17 and feature a relationship that will \"challenge\" audiences. Rumors have swirled that it could be a reason that Phoenix was uncomfortable with the graphic sex scenes, but it should be reiterated that the actor worked on the script with Haynes and Raymond.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick star Danny Ramirez joined the project recently and was tapped as the love interest for Phoenix's character. Little was known about the plot, but it was set to feature the pair intertwined in one of Haynes' signature chaotic tales.\n\nThis is seemingly written with the project in the past because, without Phoenix, the film is said to be in peril. Entire sets had been built in Guadalajara, Mexico, and the film was far enough along that reports say the actor could not be recast. The crew is reportedly out of work, and there are still major stakeholders in the film who will want to be paid.\n\nVariety notes that \"losses could exceed seven figures.\"", "source": {"uri": "flickeringmyth.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Flickering Myth"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ej_moreno@flickeringmyth.com", "name": "Ej Moreno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Haynes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Todd Haynes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Raymond", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Raymond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun:_Maverick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Top Gun: Maverick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guadalajara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guadalajara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.flickeringmyth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Haynes-Phoenix.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805222", "eventUri": "eng-9805222", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Whispers about the movie falling apart have been circulating for a while, though Phoenix apparently left the set two weeks ago. Danny Ramirez (Top Gun: Maverick, On My Block, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) co-starred in the film alongside Phoenix, but without the Beau is Afraid actor attached, Haynes' film is all but dead in the water.\n\nAccording to sources, no plans exist to recast Phoenix's role, and crew members are owed money. Phoenix reportedly walked from the project before San Diego Comic-Con kicked into high gear, and while Ramirez was at the show, he had no idea if he'd be returning to work afterward.\n\nHaynes' film revolves around two men who are intense lovers and leave California for Mexico. The reason for Phoenix's exit is unclear. Still, some have wondered if the project's intimate and explicit content was a factor. Phoenix is known for committing deeply to any role he accepts, though Haynes' plans could have crossed a line.\n\nPhoenix fans can look forward to the actor giving Arkham Asylum hell when he and Lady Gaga star in Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux, the anticipated sequel to Todd Phillips' billion-dollar blockbuster, Joker. Early reactions to Folie \u00c0 Deux paint the film as a unique blend of drama, musical, and violence.\n\nIn a social media post in March, GoldDerby reveals what it can about Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, including Lady Gaga's performance as Harley Quinzel, the film's musical elements, and how Phillips' forthcoming film toys with DC lore, taking advantage of the Elseworlds aspect of the setup.\n\nGoldDerby posted online.\n\nThe post continues,\n\nThere's no telling if Todd Haynes' untitled romance film will return to production.

In addition to his starring role, Phoenix had also developed the screenplay for the detective love story, alongside Haynes and Jon Raymond.\n\nA source close to the situation came forward to say Phoenix got \"cold feet\" in advance of shooting, according to Variety.\n\nThe crew believes Phoenix exited due to the graphic nature of the sex scenes in the film, but other sources challenged the theory, since they say that it was Phoenix himself who brought the idea to Haynes in the first place, according to the outlet.\n\nKiller Films produced the movie, and sales agent MK2 Film backed it. The project is expected to suffer significantly as a result of Phoenix's decision not to proceed with filming. Sources close to the matter said the film had already been sold to international distributors ahead of the movie's production, and the sale was hinged on Phoenix' role. Phoenix's role will not be recast, which presumably means the future of the entire project is in peril, according to Variety.\n\nFinances had already been directed to set production as well as numerous other expenses, and the entire crew that was dedicated to this movie is now out of work without notice. Stakeholders in the film will still need to be paid as part of the paperwork that was already processed, resulting in losses estimated in the range of seven figures, according to Variety.\n\nDanny Ramirez, who previously starred in \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" was cast opposite Phoenix, as his love-interest in the film.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nJoaquin Phoenix has reportedly exited Todd Haynes's forthcoming untitled gay romance just days before filming was set to begin in Guadalajara, Mexico.\n\nThe 49-year-old Joker star was set to lead the new detective love story, which he also wrote the screenplay for alongside Haynes and Jon Raymond.\n\nHowever, five days before production was scheduled to begin, Phoenix made the last-minute decision to drop out of the film after getting \"cold feet,\" a source told Variety.\n\nEntire sets had apparently already been built by the time he abandoned the project in early July.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Phoenix and Haynes's representatives for comment.\n\nProduced by Killer Films and backed by sales agent MK2 Film, the movie had already been sold to international distributors. Variety further reports that the actor's role cannot be recast, leaving the crew out of work and investors unpaid, meaning losses could surpass seven figures.\n\nIn July, Top Gun: Maverick actor Danny Ramirez signed on to play Phoenix's love interest.\n\nDirector Haynes, best known for helming queer movies, including the Oscar-nominated Carol (2015) and last year's May December, first teased the project in a 2023 interview with Variety.

His violent Joker persona emerges as a result, and he goes on to become a cult hero. Phoenix won the Oscar for his performance, and the film made more than $1bn at the box office to become the most profitable R-rated movie of all time.\n\nThe sequel will arrive in cinemas on October 4 2024 - the fifth anniversary of the original film's release.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "inga_parkel@independent.co.uk", "name": "Inga Parkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Haynes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Haynes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guadalajara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guadalajara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun:_Maverick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Top Gun: Maverick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Films", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Killer Films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/09/17/GettyImages-1797428477.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805222", "eventUri": "eng-9805222", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available. Summary Joaquin Phoenix has dropped out of an upcoming Todd Haynes movie. The movie was a 1930s-set gay detective romance co-starring Danny Ramirez. Reportedly the star got \"cold feet\" and departed several days before production began.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix has dropped out of an upcoming movie shortly before it was set to shoot. The project is an untitled feature from director Todd Haynes, who has previously helmed titles including Carol, Dark Waters, Far From Heaven, HBO's Mildred Pierce miniseries, and - most recently - May December. Phoenix had closely participated in the project, which is a gay detective romance set in the 1930s and co-starring Danny Ramirez, developing the screenplay with Haynes and co-writer Jon Raymond.\n\nPer Variety, Phoenix has now officially dropped out of the project just five days before principal photography was set to begin in Mexico, where sets had already been built. A source told the publication that the performer got \"cold feet,\" though speculation that this was due to the graphic content of the movie is dubious considering Phoenix's direct involvement in the development of the material. However, the project is now in peril, as his participation was a major factor in international sales, and his departure could lead to losses in the seven-figure realm.\n\nMore to come...", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_gearan@screenrant.com", "name": "Hannah Gearan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alexander_valentino@screenrant.com", "name": "Alexander Valentino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ben_protheroe@screenrant.com", "name": "Ben Protheroe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sean_morrison@screenrant.com", "name": "Sean Morrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sophie_humphrey@screenrant.com", "name": "Sophie Humphrey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Haynes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Haynes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mildred Pierce (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Raymond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Raymond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Principal photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/joaquin-phoenix-as-beau-looking-nervous-in-beau-is-afraid.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805222", "eventUri": "eng-9805222", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Phoenix has reportedly deserted the Todd Haynes-directed gay romance he was set to star in just five days before filming in July, per IndieWire. Promise you this: No gay actor would ever pull out. Allegedly, he got \"cold feet.\" Well, we'd note that it would also require a cold heart to leave fully built sets in Guadalajara, a crew that is ready to work, and multiple international distributors that have already purchased rights to the project. Sources claimed Phoenix's role as a corrupt cop in the 1930s cannot be recast, meaning the crew is now unemployed and losses could go up to seven figures. Danny Ramirez of Top Gun: Maverick was reportedly set to play his love interest.\n\nThere's speculation among the crew that the exit has to do with the planned NC-17 gay scenes in the film, but Phoenix is the one who pitched the \"love story and with a strong sexual component,\" as Haynes previously told Variety. \"Joaquin was pushing it further into more dangerous territory, sexually,\" Haynes said at the time.

Little was known about the plot of the movie, but the notion of two supremely talented artists like Haynes and Phoenix hooking up for the first time was reason enough to get amped. That they'd worked together closely in developing the screenplay, and were committed to doing something \"challenging\" in an emotionally, sexually explicit manner, made it sound like the kind of risky adult filmmaking we rarely get at this level anymore.\n\nAnd now, five days before it was to start shooting, Phoenix has walked away from the production, with Deadline now describing the movie as \"completely dead.\"\n\nIt is extremely rare for a film to get completely scrapped this close to principal photography (sets had been built in Guadalajara, Mexico), and in this case it's particularly strange because Phoenix was so intimately involved in its development. IndieWire first broke the story about the Oscar-winning star's departure, while Variety provided additional details on what will surely be one of the biggest showbiz stories of the year.\n\nThere will no doubt be more information to come, but here's what we know at the moment.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Haynes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Haynes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IndieWire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Principal photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guadalajara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guadalajara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/why-joaquin-phoenixs-exit-from-todd-haynes-gay-romance-movie-is-drawing-controversy/l-intro-1723234035.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805222", "eventUri": "eng-9805222", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Not by Clemson, though.\n\nWhen the Tigers offered Haynes in October of 2022, it was his very first scholarship offer. Even after that, Haynes continued to go largely unnoticed, despite the fact that he was putting up monster numbers at the high school level.\n\n\"I was under the radar, at a smaller school,\" Haynes said. \"I knew I was going to play football, though. I was going to go play football regardless, if I didn't get scholarships, because that is what I love to do.\"\n\nHaynes averaged an eye-popping 10.6 yards per carry across his junior and senior seasons. As a senior, he rushed for 476 yards in one game, the second-most in a game in Alabama high school history. He had five touchdowns in that game, scoring on runs of 96, 58, 52, 72 and 54 yards.\n\nHad he not gotten any scholarship offers, Haynes insists he still planned on playing college football. Even if he had to go the preferred walk-on route.\n\nHowever, things tend to have a way of working out. After the offer from Clemson, Georgia Tech and Washington State also offered. Auburn started to show some interest, as well.\n\nAfter his first visit to Clemson, Haynes had a pretty good idea of where he wanted to play, with the Tigers' fanbase playing a fairly big part in the decision.\n\n\"When I first came on a visit and seen it... I am from Alabama, I had been to a couple of Alabama games, a couple of Auburn games, but coming to Memorial Stadium was just this whole different feeling,\" Haynes added. \"And knowing I got an offer from there, I'm getting to see everything that is going on. Interacting with the fans and how the fans interact within the game, it's just way different. Memorial Stadium is a great place with great fans.\"\n\nHaynes believes the fans at Clemson are just different.\n\n\"Just a lot of positivity going on in the stands,\" Haynes said. \"There's bad plays in football but these fans don't buy into the negative stuff. The fans are always there to support and that is how it's different.\"\n\nAn ankle injury limited Haynes to just 14 snaps across three games while redshirting a season ago. After once again being hampered by the same injury during the spring, Haynes is now fully healthy and he can't wait to fully embrace more than 80,000 rabid Clemson fans on Saturday's this fall.\n\n\"It's great being here,\" Haynes said. \"It doesn't get no better than Clemson. The best fans, it's family. The coaches are like family. It just doesn't get better than Clemson.\"\n\nA limited number of signed footballs from Clemson's 2022 class are still available.

'It's a gay love story set in 1930s LA.'\n\n'Basically it was just this wonderful, organic way to create the script,' he also added to Variety. 'And Joaquin was pushing it further into more dangerous territory, sexually.'\n\nNeither have spoken publicly over the exit claims.\n\nJoaquin is set to return to the big screen in the eagerly-anticipated sequel to 2019's Joker, alongside Zazie Beatz and newcomer Lady Gaga - who is starring as Harley Quinn.\n\nFolie \u00e0 Deux will be premiering in cinemas on October 4 and has been described as a jukebox musical, complete with at least 15 cover songs.\n\nMuch of the plot has been kept under wraps, but the trailer saw the close bond between the superhero villain and Harley Quinn develop.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Joaquin and Todd for a comment.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page -

It's been a long journey but not much of a crazy injury.\"\n\nOne of the most frustrating parts was that it wasn't some severe injury that impacted Haynes' freshman campaign. It was an ankle sprain, something he said was similar to a high ankle sprain, that kept him on the sidelines.\n\nThen after finally getting healthy ahead of the Tigers' Gator Bowl win over Kentucky, Haynes would reinjure the same ankle in the spring and once again miss an extended period of time.\n\n\"In the spring, it was honestly the same thing,\" Haynes said. \"Just a re-tweak or whatever you want to call it. It's very frustrating. There is a lot of stuff that you can't control but it is very frustrating not being able to showcase what you can do. To show your talents and everything.\"\n\nPrior to the injury, Haynes showed flashes of what he can bring to the Clemson offense. He scored two touchdowns in his collegiate debut against Charleston Southern, one rushing and one receiving, as he totaled 28 yards on just four carries.\n\nOne thing he really prides himself on is his speed, something he feels can make a difference in 2024.\n\n\"Speed. I am pretty much a speed guy,\" Haynes said. \"I feel like I can bring some versatility and a lot of stuff to the game.

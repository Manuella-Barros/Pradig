Adam Schiff (D-CA) gained another endorsement from a former primary rival in Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), his Republican opponent for California's Senate seat, Republican Steve Garvey, is attacking him for the endorsement.\n\nSchiff and Garvey, a former professional baseball star, are set to face off against each other in the race to replace the late Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's seat. In his attack, Garvey claimed Schiff would continue Lee's agenda.\n\n\"Adam Schiff says he looks forward to continuing to work with Barbara Lee, whose agenda is a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, out-of-control crime, $50 minimum wage, and a failed track record with the Latino community,\" Garvey said. \"Californians loudly rejected Barbara Lee's pro-Hamas, pro-criminal agenda in the primary and I look forward to seeing them reject Adam Schiff and this agenda in November.\"\n\nSome of Garvey's claims, however, are not backed up by Schiff's comments.\n\nIn the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, Schiff emerged as one of the most pro-Israel Democrats in California's Senate primary. In March, however, Schiff echoed the White House's calls for a temporary ceasefire amid the growing death toll in Gaza.\n\n\"My position is the same as the administration,\" Schiff said, \"which is there needs to be a deal to release the hostages and have a pause in the fighting.\"\n\nIt is unclear if he would back a permanent ceasefire in the region as his office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome of Garvey's claims, however, are not true. Schiff has not called for a $50 per hour minimum wage as Lee had. In the Democratic primary debates, Schiff instead called for a minimum wage in the range of $20-$25 per hour.\n\nGarvey's claim that Schiff would advance a \"pro-criminal\" agenda is unverifiable. His website details Schiff's approach to criminal justice reform and public safety. It states that Schiff believes in \"progressive and practical criminal justice reform that will root out discriminatory practices and make our streets safe for everyone - no matter where they live or what they look like.\"\n\nOn public safety, his campaign laid out some policy ideas Schiff has.\n\n\"Adam supports an assault weapons ban, red flag laws, and universal background checks, among many other proposals,\" the website reads.\n\nRegarding the Latino community, Schiff has been endorsed by several Latino lawmakers across California.\n\n\"Whether it's fighting for workers rights or better health care access for our families -- Adam Schiff has consistently been on the side of Latino families here in California,\" said Democratic state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo.\n\nGarvey's campaign defended his statement and told the Washington Examiner that because Schiff has accepted Lee's endorsement and mentioned his eagerness in working with her, he has effectively endorsed Lee's agenda.\n\n\"Californians have a clear choice this November in who they want representing them in the Senate -- a Trump apologist or a defender of democracy,\" Lee said in a statement Wednesday. \"Now more than ever, we need to elect people like Adam Schiff, who will stand up against the autocrats looking to divide this country and dismantle our democracy.\"\n\n\"For decades in Congress, I've worked alongside Adam to deliver for Californians. I'm honored to endorse him for the United States Senate,\" she added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSchiff was appreciative of the endorsement.\n\n\"I've had the great privilege of working alongside her in the House to deliver for California families, and I look forward to continuing to partner with her to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for every Californian,\" Schiff said. \"I'm so grateful for her support in this race.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Katie Porter in endorsing Schiff\n\nBy Evan Symon, May 9, 2024 12:59 pm\n\n09 May 2024 12:59 pm\n\nCongresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA), who recently came in 4th place in the U.S. Senate race primary with 9.8% of the vote, announced her endorsement of Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), her one-time Senate race rival, she announced in a statement late on Wednesday.\n\nThe Oakland-based Congresswoman was the third major candidate to enter the Senate race last year, coming into the race after only a few weeks after both Schiff and Congresswoman Katie Porter (D-CA) entered the race. Initially, Lee was seen as a challenger for at least second place based on her longtime Congressional career, which began back in 1998. However, her far left stances quickly distanced her from voters, with polls never having her reach above 13% and lee never being able to crack the top 2 candidate barrier.\n\nThe death of Senator Diane Feinstein in September briefly raised hope for Lee as Newsom had pledged to pick a black candidate previously, and Lee being chosen to serve the remainder of Feinstein's term would have given her a big boost in support as she would be the incumbent. However, Governor Gavin Newsom opted to select a caregiver candidate who would not run for another term to keep the election fair, dashing her hopes. This, plus the entrance of former baseball star Steve Garvey (R) in the race in October sent lee spiraling into 4th place and below the 10% poll mark for the rest of the race.\n\nWhile there were a few bright spots, such as Lee leading support for being the official endorsed Democratic candidate in the race at a largely split California Democratic Party vote in November, support remained low going into debate season in January. Failing to reach 10% and her support largely focused either in the Oakland area or amongst the far left, Lee barely qualified for the three debates. In the end, she finished a distant fourth behind Schiff, Garvey, and Porter, coming in 4th place with 717,129 votes, or 9.8% of the vote, in the primary election in March.\n\nWith Lee now officially out of the race and being out of her House seat come January because of her focusing on her Senate campaign and not running for her House seat again, many analysts began waiting to see if she would give an endorsement or not. Porter, the other top candidate in the race who came short, had previously announced her endorsement of Schiff in Late March, with all eyes being on Lee. Many Democrats even wondered if she would even back Schiff, considering how much farther to the left she is than either Schiff or Porter.\n\nLee announces that she will back Schiff\n\nHowever, fears were quelled on Wednesday when Lee announced that she would be officially endorsing Schiff for the Senate over Garvey.\n\n\"Californians have a clear choice this November in who they want representing them in the Senate -- a Trump apologist or a defender of democracy,\" said Lee on Wednesday. \"Now more than ever, we need to elect people like Adam Schiff, who will stand up against the autocrats looking to divide this country and dismantle our democracy. For decades in Congress, I've worked alongside Adam to deliver for Californians. I'm honored to endorse him for the United States Senate.\"\n\nLater on Wednesday, Schiff thanked Lee for her support, even agreeing to be a special guest at a retirement fundraiser for her later on.\n\n\"Lee is one of our nation's most powerful advocates for social justice and a tireless fighter to combat economic injustice, champion health care for all, and protect civil rights,\" noted Schiff. \"I've had the great privilege of working alongside her in the House to deliver for California families, and I look forward to continuing to partner with her to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for every Californian. I'm so grateful for her support in this race.\"\n\nLee's support gives Schiff yet another member of Congress officially backing him in the race. To date, he has virtually all California House members officially endorsing him this November, as well as both of his main Democratic Senate rivals to boot. However, while Lee's support and likely fundraising abilities will likely help Schiff out, especially amongst far left and Bay Area voters, analysts have said that the endorsement will likely not do much overall because of Schiff's lock with Democratic voters overall.\n\n\"Schiff needs more moderates and independents, not more Democrats right now,\" Angela Hewitt, a Washington based elections analyst, told the Globe on Thursday. \"Garvey is aiming not only for them, but also for Latino voters in key areas. Should he gain ground in all three, he keeps his remote chance of a victory alive. Lee's supporters would already be voting for Schiff anyway. Sure, she also helps with fundraising events, but Schiff has a big war chest. If anything, he is helping her more by going to her fundraisers so she goes in debt free in retirement.\"\n\n\"Her name does add another name candidate to his list of endorsers, but again, it is in an area in which he already had a lock in voters. He's not going to say no to her support, obviously, but he would rather be going to events to bring in more independents for him rather than fundraisers for her. Her endorsement is something of a mixed blessing if anything.\"\n\nMore endorsements are likely to be announced soon as the November election is now less than 6 months away.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V.

Dianne Feinstein, who announced early in 2023 that she wouldn't run for another term and died in autumn.\n\nWhile Porter launched political attacks against Schiff, the front-runner, throughout the campaign, Lee mostly stayed above the fray, rarely singling out her opponents by name.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for her support in this race,\" Schiff said in a statement.\n\nGarvey, a Republican, avoided taking positions on many of the most pressing issues and sidestepped questions about whether he would vote for Donald Trump in November. The former athlete consolidated the California's Republican vote in the primary, while support from Democratic voters splintered among Schiff, Porter and Lee.\n\nGarvey finished first in the March primary with 33% of the vote. Schiff came in second with 29%, followed by Porter with 17% and Lee with 11%\n\nThe fundraiser Wednesday morning was held at Washington D.C.'s National Democratic Club, according to the invite. The event was billed as \"a breakfast reception honoring Congresswoman Barbara Lee in recognition for a career of devoted service featuring special guest Congressman Adam Schiff.\"\n\nThe invite asked for donations from political action committees of up to $5,000 and up to $1,000 from individuals. Federal Election Commission records show that from the start of 2023 through the end of March 2024, Lee's senate campaign raised $5.4 million. The campaign ended March with $330,330.37 cash on hand and $291,357.95 debts or loans owed.\n\n\"They have worked together for decades and hosted a fundraiser together to close out the campaign and prepare for what's next, which includes keeping Joe Biden in the White House and electing a House and Senate he can work with this November,\" Robert Dempsey, Lee's former campaign manager, said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person",

Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) on Wednesday joined Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) in officially endorsing Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) for the Senate seat they all three sought.\n\nSchiff will now face Republican baseball star Steve Garvey in the general election, after they emerged as the top two vote-getters in the state's nonpartisan primary in March.\n\n\"Californians have a clear choice this November in who they want representing them in the Senate -- a Trump apologist or a defender of democracy,\" Lee said in a statement Wednesday. \"Now more than ever, we need to elect people like Adam Schiff, who will stand up against the autocrats looking to divide this country and dismantle our democracy.\"\n\n\"For decades in Congress, I've worked alongside Adam to deliver for Californians. I'm honored to endorse him for the United States Senate,\" she added.\n\nSchiff thanked Lee for her support, calling her \"one of our nation's most powerful advocates for social justice and a tireless fighter to combat economic injustice, champion health care for all, and protect civil rights.\"\n\n\"I've had the great privilege of working alongside her in the House to deliver for California families, and I look forward to continuing to partner with her to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for every Californian,\" Schiff continued. \"I'm so grateful for her support in this race.\"\n\nLee's endorsement comes after Porter endorsed Schiff in a local interview in late March, saying, \"I think he is the right choice for Californians.\"\n\n\"I called Adam I think it was Thursday after the election, and we had a pleasant exchange. He's my colleague, he continues to be my colleague in the House of Representatives, as does Barbara Lee. And Adam and Steve Garvey will have a race going all the way through November,\" she continued. \"I hope very much that Adam will come and campaign here in Orange County.\n\n\"So while I'm not on the ballot in November, I'm very, very involved already in trying to help other candidates win, including House candidates across California, so I'm sure I'll get a chance to see Adam on the campaign trail and continue to work with him,\" she added.\n\nWhen the news anchor pressed whether that means she's endorsing Schiff, Porter said, \"Yes, of course. I strongly support him. I think he's the right choice for Californians.\"\n\nAfter months of a close primary race between the crowded field of candidates, Schiff emerged as the top candidate, with 31.6 percent of the vote, followed by Garvey's 31.5 percent. Porter came in third with 15.3 percent, and Lee followed with 9.8 percent, according to Decision Desk HQ's election returns.\n\nIn California's nonpartisan system, the top two vote-getters move on to the general election in November, regardless of party affiliation. Schiff's allies had worked to elevate Garvey, the Republican, in hopes of an easier red-blue match-up in the general, rather than a battle between Democrats.\n\nThe candidates are vying for the seat vacated by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), which is now being filled temporarily by appointee Sen. Laphonza Butler (D). Butler opted not to join the crowded primary field to try to hold onto the seat for a full term.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_fortinsky@thehill.com", "name": "Sarah Fortinsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbara Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Garvey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Garvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonpartisan blanket primary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision Desk HQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Feinstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dianne Feinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonpartisanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/schiffadam_022824gn02_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554952", "eventUri": "eng-9554952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Adam Schiff, D-Calif. has eclectic taste.\n\n\"This will sound very trite, but 'To Kill a Mockingbird,'\" Schiff said, confessing the 1962 Gregory Peck classic to be his favorite movie -- with a caveat. \"The Big Lebowski,\" the 1998 Coen brothers film, is his favorite comedy...one he loves so much that he quoted it in the Oval Office last week after President Joe Biden signed an executive order to expand two California monuments.\n\nBiden, he said, loves to quote movies, though the president admitted his staff doesn't always get his references. Schiff shared with Biden that he loves quipping quotes from films as well, then glanced down at the floor and realized he had a unique opportunity.\n\n\"I said, 'Mr. President, this rug really ties the whole room together,'\" chuckled Schiff, referring to the dark blue rug bearing the presidential seal. (The president laughed, Schiff said, though he decided against asking if Biden really got the reference.)\n\nLike his wide-ranging taste in movies, Schiff is hoping to appeal to the masses this fall after a brutal California U.S. Senate primary that showed just how divided idealistically voters in the Golden State can be. His Democratic opponents, Reps. Katie Porter and Barabara Lee represented more liberal factions of the party. Schiff represents a more middle-of-the-road voter.\n\nDespite boxing out Lee and Porter to face former Los Angeles Dodger and Republican nominee Steve Garvey, the Burbank Democrat says he is not taking any vote for granted in sapphire blue California.\n\n\"My view is you run scared, or you run unopposed. So I'm campaigning hard, traveling all around the state and really enjoying it. It's a great opportunity to get to know the different communities and challenges facing every part of this magnificent state,\" said Schiff.\n\nThe last time a Republican was elected to statewide office in California was in 2006 when Arnold Schwartzenager became Governor. But while Schiff is confident in his own campaign, he's not missing the opportunity to take swipes at Garvey, tying him to former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Mr. Garvey voted for Trump repeatedly. He won't say what he's going to do now, which either means he's going to support him again -- notwithstanding all of his unethical, democracy destroying conduct -- or he's not going to support him. But he lacks the courage of his convictions. You won't tell the public? Well, when you're a senator, your votes are public, you don't get to hide.\"\n\nLast month, POLITICO reported Garvey had nearly $4 million in liens on himself and his businesses, something Schiff is using to connect the Republican candidate to Trump.\n\n\"I think this is just another illustration of the problem of elected officials, or potential elected officials who say, essentially, the rules are for other people. You know, paying taxes is for suckers. That seems to be the view of former President Trump. It seems to be the view of Steve Garvey. But look, I think, you know, we all need to play by the rules,\" argued Schiff. \"If you're going to ask California to say, trust me that I know how to conduct business so that I am a responsible business person, then you have to prove it. And his record is not encouraging.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Garvey told Politico last month he was working on paying off the debt when the story was published. Spectrum News reached out to Garvey's team for further comment. In a response, his spokesperson did not acknowledge a question regarding Garvey's taxes, instead sharing a statement attacking Schiff for accepting an endorsement from Barbara Lee.\n\nGarvey, for his part, has publicly accused Schiff of being silent on the campus protests that have been popping up across the country in response to the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"The right to protest, the right to assemble and disagree and petition the government is a fundamental American right part of the First Amendment,\" Schiff said. \"But it is also very much the law that a university can set a time, place, and manner restriction in a content-neutral way that basically says whether you're for the war or against the war for Israel -- or whatever the case may be -- a university can say, 'here's where you can demonstrate, you cannot camp out on our campus, because that interferes with people's ability to walk through campus.' And they can enforce those rules.\"\n\n\"If people want to engage in civilly disobedient conduct and get arrested, then they should not hide their faces behind ski masks,\" he continued. \"They should never engage in violence, they should never engage in vandalism. They should never engage in hate speech. And the degree to which Jewish students on campus feel unsafe and unwelcome, the degree of anti-semitism we're seeing on college campuses and elsewhere, is deplorable.\"\n\nNo student of any faith, he said, shouldn't feel unwelcome on a college campus.\n\nBut there is growing concern amongst Democrats that a protest vote, driven by Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, could hand the White House and down-ballot races to Republicans. Schiff said he is trying to make the case to young voters that \"if you don't like the way things are heading, you don't like the way things are run, vote -- because if you voted your numbers, you will change the direction of the country. And that that's empowering.\"\n\nVoter turnout in California for the primary election was low, despite every voter receiving a mail in ballot per a 2021 law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Schiff indicated that he believed it was due to the fact the race at the top of the ticket was all but uncontested for both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\"In a presidential cycle, it's the presidential race that drives turnout. I am going to be working my tail off to drive up turnout to do whatever I can in California, not only in my own race, but there are six or seven competitive House seats in California [that] could control or determine who controls Congress,\" he said, promising to focus his campaign efforts in parts of the state to draw support to at-risk Democratic seats.\n\n\"I'm going to be particularly focusing my campaign efforts in those parts of California, where every voter I turn out to support me is also going to turn out and support others running on the same ticket.\"\n\nWhen it comes to his own bid for Senate, Schiff says he plans to focus on affordability issues, such as childcare and housing.\n\n\"I think the twin crises of a lack of affordable housing and homelessness are really only to the same core problem -- that is, we don't have enough housing, period. We need to build hundreds of thousands of units of new housing, so that people who are working and have a decent income...who are working full time could afford a place to live, and that we don't have so many people living on the street,\" said Schiff. \"Until we solve the supply problem, we're never going to solve either challenge. And I think at the federal level, we can provide tax incentives to build a lot more housing.\"\n\nSchiff says when it comes to the possibility that Trump could be re-elected and if he is elected senator that they would have to work together, he promised to \"get things done, no matter who the president is.\"\n\n\"But I do fear that if he were ever to become president, all of us are going to have to be spending a lot of time just defending our democracy, our institutions, protecting the Justice Department from being weaponized against his opponents, protecting civil servants from being essentially drummed out of their jobs and in favor of political hacks. We're going to have to be doing some very basic defense of our democracy.\"\n\nBut, as Schiff's favorite song by Tom Petty goes, he says he \"won't back down\" from the fight.\n\n\"The problem with Donald Trump is he wants to attack our very democracy, and someone who wants to essentially bring down the system is not someone that you can generally work with,\" Schiff said. \"And so I think this is a democracy inflection point. This is not a typical election -- the stakes are much higher.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Adam Schiff (D-CA) gained another endorsement from a former primary rival in Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), his Republican opponent for California's Senate seat, Republican Steve Garvey, is attacking him for the endorsement.\n\nSchiff and Garvey, a former professional baseball star, are set to face off against each other in the race to replace the late Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's seat. In his attack, Garvey claimed Schiff would continue Lee's agenda.\n\n\"Adam Schiff says he looks forward to continuing to work with Barbara Lee, whose agenda is a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, out-of-control crime, $50 minimum wage, and a failed track record with the Latino community,\" Garvey said. \"Californians loudly rejected Barbara Lee's pro-Hamas, pro-criminal agenda in the primary and I look forward to seeing them reject Adam Schiff and this agenda in November.\"\n\nSome of Garvey's claims, however, are not backed up by Schiff's comments.\n\nIn the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, Schiff emerged as one of the most pro-Israel Democrats in California's Senate primary. In March, however, Schiff echoed the White House's calls for a temporary ceasefire amid the growing death toll in Gaza.\n\n\"My position is the same as the administration,\" Schiff said, \"which is there needs to be a deal to release the hostages and have a pause in the fighting.\"\n\nIt is unclear if he would back a permanent ceasefire in the region as his office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome of Garvey's claims, however, are not true. Schiff has not called for a $50 per hour minimum wage as Lee had. In the Democratic primary debates, Schiff instead called for a minimum wage in the range of $20-$25 per hour.\n\nGarvey's claim that Schiff would advance a \"pro-criminal\" agenda is unverifiable. His website details Schiff's approach to criminal justice reform and public safety. It states that Schiff believes in \"progressive and practical criminal justice reform that will root out discriminatory practices and make our streets safe for everyone - no matter where they live or what they look like.\"\n\nOn public safety, his campaign laid out some policy ideas Schiff has.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Adam supports an assault weapons ban, red flag laws, and universal background checks, among many other proposals,\" the website reads.\n\nRegarding the Latino community, Schiff has been endorsed by several Latino lawmakers across California.\n\n\"Whether it's fighting for workers rights or better health care access for our families -- Adam Schiff has consistently been on the side of Latino families here in California,\" said Democratic state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo.\n\nGarvey's campaign defended his statement and told the Washington Examiner that because Schiff has accepted Lee's endorsement and mentioned his eagerness in working with her, he has effectively endorsed Lee's agenda.\n\n\"Californians have a clear choice this November in who they want representing them in the Senate -- a Trump apologist or a defender of democracy,\" Lee said in a statement Wednesday. \"Now more than ever, we need to elect people like Adam Schiff, who will stand up against the autocrats looking to divide this country and dismantle our democracy.\"\n\n\"For decades in Congress, I've worked alongside Adam to deliver for Californians. I'm honored to endorse him for the United States Senate,\" she added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSchiff was appreciative of the endorsement.\n\n\"I've had the great privilege of working alongside her in the House to deliver for California families, and I look forward to continuing to partner with her to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for every Californian,\" Schiff said. \"I'm so grateful for her support in this race.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

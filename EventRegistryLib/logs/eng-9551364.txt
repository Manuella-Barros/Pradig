So, is this uptick the start of something big?\n\nA strong April\n\nThere's actually a lot of data for the electric car industry. In addition to quarterly reports, companies report monthly deliveries, giving us insights into how the business is performing.\n\nNIO has been underdelivering on promised sales growth for some time. So, April's deliveries came as something of a surprise. The company delivered 15,620 vehicles in April, up a solid 134% versus a year ago.\n\nThis was driven by the launch of the company's 2024 series, including updated versions of the ES8, ES6, EC7, EC6, and ET5T.\n\nWhat's more, this sales growth came as its peers slowed down. Li Auto -- still my favourite Chinese EV pick -- saw sales slow to 25,787 vehicles, up just 0.41% versus last year. Xpeng's sales were up 32% versus last April.\n\nHowever, one data point does not make a trend. Deliveries were up up 31.6% from March.\n\nWhat should we make of the figures?\n\nIt's great to see deliveries picking up, but NIO isn't setting the world alight. If NIO were able to maintain this production rate throughout the year, it would deliver 180,000 cars. That's just 20,000 more than last year. It remains unclear whether deliveries will pick up from here, or whether they will regress to where they were in Q1.\n\nThe data suggests that NIO needs to be hitting much greater volumes to start turning a profit. As noted, NIO sold only around 160,000 vehicles in 2024 and lost about $35,000 a car. By comparison, Li Auto delivered 376,030 and turned a profit. After years of underdelivering, there's some distance between NIO and its peers.\n\nProfitability seems as far away today as it did a few years ago. Its initial goal of profitability by 2024 seems to have been pushed back by at least two years. If all goes according to plan, we might see NIO reach the black in 2027.\n\nThe bottom line on NIO\n\nNIO is currently trading at 24 times projected earnings for 2027 -- that's the breakeven year. That concerns me because a lot can go wrong in three years.\n\nAnd why would I pay 24 times projected earnings, for 2027, for NIO stock when I could pay 17.1 times 2024 earnings for Li Auto? I appreciate that's not a perfect comparison, but it highlights some of the risks of investing in NIO.\n\nMoreover, NIO's unique selling point is its battery-swapping technology, and I'm no longer convinced this is the way forward for the EV industry. Drivers of NIO vehicles can pull up at NIO swapping stations and receive a new battery in a few minutes.\n\nBut charging technology is getting better and better. The new Li Auto Mega can be charged in just 12 minutes and doesn't need its own infrastructure.\n\nNIO might continue its gains if sales kick on in May, but I'm not convinced about its long-term trajectory.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

($NIO) for its growing portfolio of premium EVs and sub-brands, but the Chinese automaker is also the global leader in EV battery swap stations. As of October 2023, NIO has successfully completed over 30 million battery swaps around the world, proving the technology is a viable alternative to standard plug-in and charge EV practices.\n\nTo help expand battery technology, especially as it pertains to infrastructure, NIO has begun enlisting the help of some of its competitors with the goal of establishing EV battery standards in China and possibly beyond.\n\nIn late April, during the Beijing Auto Show, CEOs from NIO and Lotus Technology announced a new strategic cooperation, detailing plans to co-develop charging and battery swap technologies. Some items on their to-do list include charging and swap technologies, battery asset management and operations, service network operations, vehicle R&D and customization, and, of course, a unified battery standard system.\n\nJust a couple of weeks later, NIO announced a similar agreement with a heavy hitter in Chinese automotive -- Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd., or GAC Group for short.\n\nEarlier today, executives from NIO and GAC Group met in Guangzhou, China, where their new strategic cooperation will take place. NIO founder, chairman, and CEO William LI shook hands with GAC Group president Feng Xingya, while NIO Power senior vice president Fei SHEN and GAC Group vice president Xia Xianqing signed the agreement on behalf of the companies.\n\nSimilar to the previously mentioned agreement with Lotus, NIO and GAC have presented a list of targeted goals to cooperate on, many of which are similar:\n\nAs we mentioned before, NIO has successfully proven that a large-scale battery swap network is not only plausible, but an effective solution in quick EV charging processes. Now, it appears NIO is looking to recruit others to help standardize the technology to further streamline the swap process for consumers, no matter what make or EV model they are driving. GAC Group president Feng Xingya shared a similar sentiment:\n\nGoing forward, with the growing NEV population, battery swapping will unleash unlimited market opportunities, especially in cities. Because it actually solves a pain point for many users who don't have dedicated parking spots. I'm glad to see that NIO and GAC can partner in this area. The strategic cooperation agreement that we signed today is also a foundation and guidance for our future cooperation. With it as a starting point, we hope to build more battery swap stations with which our GAC Aion users will have a better swapping experience.\n\nIn addition to the laundry list of items to collaborate on going forward, NIO and GAC state they will still promote the opening of their respective charging platforms to one another. So, the companies will remain collaborative in many ways while keeping some technologies close to their chests. These are still competitors in China, after all.\n\nStill, the collaborative spirit NIO is putting out into the ether in China is inspiring and appears to be working. With GAC Group now onboard, NIO has assembled an impressive lineup of Chinese OEMs committed to developing a unified battery standard. That list currently includes Chang'an Automobile, Geely Holding Group, Chery Automobile, JAC Group, and Lotus.", "source": {"uri": "electrek.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Electrek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scooter_doll@electrek.co", "name": "Scooter Doll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nio Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAC_Group", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "GAC Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Cars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lotus Cars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric-vehicle_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric-vehicle battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aion_(marque)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aion (marque)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_swapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery swapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chery", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAC_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JAC Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang'an", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chang'an"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charging station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/NIO-GAC-battery-swap.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551364", "eventUri": "eng-9551364", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

The company held a ceremony attended by NIO founder, chairman, and CEO William Li as it continues its reign as a leader in its given segment in China while simultaneously expanding globally.\n\nIt has been ten years since NIO ($NIO) was founded in China and seven years since it officially launched its first all-electric model - the ES8 SUV. The automaker has since launched several additional models, including the ES7, EC6, ET5, and ultra-luxe ET7 sedan.\n\nAs the Chinese automaker continues to expand the production and availability of its passenger EVs to new markets in Europe, NIO also continues to grow its network of battery swap stations. Recently, it enlisted the help of several other OEMs to help create a new battery standard system in China to streamline the charging and swapping experience for consumers.\n\nBack in its native land, NIO currently operates as the leader in premium EVs and is celebrating its latest production milestone with a nod to the model that started it all.\n\nAccording to a recent Weibo post, NIO has surpassed 500,000 production EVs built since its inception, celebrating the achievement with a ceremony held at its Hefei factory in the Anhui province of China, attended by local officials and NIO's founder and CEO, William Li. Per the post:\n\nThe mass production of 500,000 units is not only a milestone, but also the trust and expectations of 500,000 users. Let us follow the camera and witness the moment when 500,000 mass-produced vehicles rolled off the assembly line, and witness the growth and innovation power of NIO.\n\nTo mark the completion of the 500,000th production vehicle, NIO assembled an ES8 SUV, its first model, as seen above. In addition to the production milestone, NIO shared another encouraging metric: it has ranked #1 in the premium BEV segment in China for vehicles priced at RMB 300,000 ($41,550) and above each year consecutively since 2019.\n\nAnother fascinating figure is that NIO rolled its 100,000 production EVs off its assembly lines in April 2021 and has quintupled that number in the three years since. This is more evidence of the automaker's continued growth in an ultra-competitive EV market in China.

The move is also expected to allow NIO to cut expenses further as it opens the money-losing power network to other automakers.\n\nDetails: According to a Wednesday release, the two automakers plan to develop a standardized battery module that would facilitate the roll-out of swap station-compatible passenger EVs from both sides.\n\nContext: Guangzhou-headquartered GAC is the latest Chinese automaker to announce that its EV owners will have access to NIO's nationwide infrastructure network, following deals with Changan, Geely, JAC, and Chery, as well as the company's link-ups with state-owned utilities Wenergy Group and China's Southern Power Grid.", "source": {"uri": "technode.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechNode"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jill_shen@technode.com", "name": "Jill Shen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nio Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAC_Group", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "GAC Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_swapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery swapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern and southern China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Range anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changan_Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changan Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Southern_Power_Grid", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China Southern Power Grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chery", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAC_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JAC Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://technode.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NIO-and-GAC-Become-Partners-on-Charging-and-Swapping1-e1715246720230.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551364", "eventUri": "eng-9551364", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

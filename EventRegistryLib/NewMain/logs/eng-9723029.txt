Email nic.white @mailonline.com\n\nA woman's mid-flight meltdown that led to her biting a chunk of fabric out of a flight attendant's shirt was sparked by a petty toilet squabble.\n\nThe woman was on United Airlines Flight 762 from Miami to Newark but barely made it off the runway on Tuesday night before she went ballistic.\n\nThree flight attendants, along with burly passengers, were needed to wrestle her into zip-ties until the flight could be diverted to Orlando.\n\nStaff went to great lengths to stop the woman's rampage, seating 'the biggest bodies' on the plane next to her until police could haul her away.\n\nA passenger bit a chunk of fabric out of a flight attendant's shirt in a mid-fight meltdown\n\nA man who said he was also passenger on the flight claimed the meltdown started simply because the woman was blocked from getting to the plane's bathroom.\n\n'She apparently verbally and then physically attacked a family in the back of the plane after not being able to go to the bathroom at one moment,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\n'The kids were screaming - not as loud as her though...

They're handcuffing me. Why are you handcuffing me?' she yelled.\n\nVideo recorded by another traveler began after the crew restrained her wrists with zip-ties and she was wrestling with three of them\n\nThe video cuts to the woman, now with her hands zip-tied behind her back and standing in the aisle, yelling at everyone not to fly United\n\n'Why b***h? Why the f**k are you handcuffing me? Why, why, why?'\n\nA passenger told her to stop yelling and she told her 'go back to Russia, old lady', then let out a steady stream of expletives and told her 'I'll f**king kill you, b***h'.\n\nAudio from the plane caught the woman yelling: 'You're a disgrace, piece of s**t, I wish I could f**king spit on you right now.'\n\n'Don't do that, don't do that,' a male flight attendant warned her.

The woman was on United Airlines Flight 762 from Miami to Newark but barely made it off the runway on Tuesday night before she went ballistic.\n\nThree flight attendants, along with burly passengers, were needed to wrestle her into zip-ties until the flight could be diverted to Orlando. Staff went to great lengths to stop the woman's rampage, seating 'the biggest bodies' on the plane next to her until police could haul her away.\n\nA man who said he was also passenger on the flight claimed the meltdown started simply because the woman was blocked from getting to the plane's bathroom. 'She apparently verbally and then physically attacked a family in the back of the plane after not being able to go to the bathroom at one moment,' he told DailyMail.com. 'The kids were screaming - not as loud as her though... I remember when I used to act like this aged two or three when I didn't get ice cream.'\n\nThe passenger said staff escorted her to a different seat around the middle of the plane while she was yelling and cursing at everyone on board. However, separating her from the family didn't end the disgraceful episode, as she threw punches and spat on staff and other passengers who tried to help.\n\n'She eventually got physical with a flight attendant and began attacking him, then the attendant in white latched onto her trying to stop her,' the man said. 'After it got out of control, it was decided to cuff her after she threatened the plane, since all flight attendants on board had to get involved.'\n\n'She resists the cuffs as she bites, spits, and kicks at this man so others and even passengers have to step in to help. One passenger who got up to help was spit at multiple times in the face by this woman while being threatened.' The fellow passenger said staff found 'the biggest bodies on the plane' and put them next to the woman so she would be trapped in her seat row until the flight landed.\n\nVideo recorded by another traveler began after the crew restrained her wrists with zip-ties and she was wrestling with three of them. Suddenly she bit one of their shoulders, tearing off a piece of fabric and letting it float to the floor in front of the shocked passengers. 'Stop touching me... let go of me, I'm a f**king girl, are you trying to kill me?' she shouted afterwards. The video cuts to the woman, now with her hands zip-tied behind her back and standing in the aisle, yelling at everyone not to fly United.\n\n'These people have an attitude problem and they don't f**king do their jobs. They're handcuffing me. Why are you handcuffing me?' she yelled. 'Why b***h? Why the f**k are you handcuffing me? Why, why, why?' A passenger told her to stop yelling and she told her 'go back to Russia, old lady', then let out a steady stream of expletives and told her 'I'll f**king kill you, b***h'.\n\nAudio from the plane caught the woman yelling: 'You're a disgrace, piece of s**t, I wish I could f**king spit on you right now.' 'Don't do that, don't do that,' a male flight attendant warned her. 'You are insulting everyone on this aircraft.' Everyone applauded when she was finally kicked off the plane after the flight landed in Orlando where it was delayed three-and-a-half hours. More videos from Orlando showed the woman being marched out of the airport by police. 'The plane is here in Orlando and the crew is not going to continue on [to Newark] because of what happened between here and Miami,' staff announced.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

I told her that fortunately, I haven't personally seen any unruly passengers on a plane but I have witnessed an incident at Miami International Airport (MIA), which I'll elaborate on down below.\n\nBut first, there's a video circulating on social media in which you can clearly see a female passenger take a huge chunk out of the male flight attendant's uniform.\n\nWatch the video here.\n\nTMZ was the first to obtain the video and reports that it happened on a \"United Flight 762 from Miami to Newark, New Jersey Tuesday ... and, it shows an upset passenger screaming at other passengers while the flight crew tries to restrain her, wrapping zip ties around her wrists.\"\n\nTMZ also reports that the flight was delayed 3.5 hours and the flight crew had to be changed out because of the ordeal, per another clip. They also received a statement from United, which confirmed the incident: \"United flight 762 from Miami to Newark stopped in Orlando on Tuesday evening after a passenger became aggressive and disruptive. Our flight attendants worked to de-escalate the situation and protect other customers and after landing in Orlando, law enforcement met the flight, and the passenger was removed. We're grateful to our team for their professionalism and for looking out for the safety of our customers and their fellow United employees.\"\n\nPre-pandemic, you would rarely hear about irate passengers but times have changed and these types of incidents are becoming more and more common.\n\nIn May 2021, I wrote about surprising my dad at his senior home for my first post-pandemic visit, to bring him back to California with me. I wrote: \"I gotta tell ya: Miami Airport has some real interesting characters, especially three young women in their early twenties who everyone could hear almost get in a fight near Caf\u00e9 Versailles. Then they came strolling through our gate area screaming profanities with their masks off and two little kids (around four) following close behind. I couldn't keep my mouth shut so I yelled at them to watch their language around little kids. That's when a rather large woman said, \"Those are my kids!\" So I said, \"What a great role model you are.\" She then started calling me a white man and some obscenities but kept walking. When they reached the end of the E Gates, they made their way back, still screaming at the world and at me and anyone who looked at them. Not one MIA or AA employee said a word. It was like they're used to it.\"\n\nI do think the pandemic really messed some people up and there's definitely a rise in the number of unruly passengers that flight crew have had to deal with. Perhaps we're hearing more about these incidents these days because almost everyone has a smartphone and access to social media so stories like this can go viral in a matter of minutes. Fortunately, I haven't experienced this type of behavior in the air and I hope it stays that way.

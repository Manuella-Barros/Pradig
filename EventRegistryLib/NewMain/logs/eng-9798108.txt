Throughout the process, she actually felt perfectly normal. She just interacted with IOA President PT Usha, and she told her that although she is physically and medically perfectly normal, she's disappointed that this is her third Olympics and that she was disqualified.\"\n\nScience behind weight-cut\n\nPardiwala explained the process that goes behind weight-cut and why wrestlers usually prefer fighting in a category that is lesser than their usual weight.\n\n\"Wrestlers usually participate in a weight category less than their natural weight. It gives them an advantage since they are fighting with less stronger opponents. The process of weight cut prior to the weigh-in in the morning involves a calculated restriction of food and water. Besides this, the athlete needs to sweat and that is done through sauna and exercise,\" Pardiwala said.\n\n\"This weight cut has the benefit of putting you in a lighter category but does cause weakness and energy depletion. And this is counter-productive to participation. So, most wrestlers will thereafter go for some amount of energy restoration with some amount of water and higher energy foods. And these are usually given after the weigh-in,\" he added.\n\nThe Indian contingent's chief medical officer furthermore added that the wrestler featuring in three bouts meant that her nutritionist had to give her some amount of water to avoid dehydration.\n\n\"The calculation from the nutritionist which is done is athlete specific and Vinesh's nutritionist felt that the usual amount that she takes is 1.5 Kg - throughout the day - which gives her enough energy for the bout. Sometimes there's also the factor of rebound weight gained following the fight. Vinesh had three bouts, and to prevent dehydration, some amount of water had to be given.\"", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_cutting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weight cutting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sauna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Usha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P.

As the nation was hoping to see the first female Olympic champion, the news of Vinesh Phogat's disqualification due to the failed weigh-in in Paris on Wednesday morning sent shockwaves.\n\nVinesh's usual weight is around 57 kg, but she competes in the 50 kg category, requiring significant effort to stay within the limit. Before her semi-final match, Vinesh's weight was precariously close to the threshold at 49.9 kg. Post-match, she weighed 52.7 kg and had to work continuously to reduce it without breaks for food or drink. Despite efforts, she managed to get down to 50.1 kg by the next morning but ran out of time to shed the remaining weight.\n\nIt was Vinesh Phogat's third Olympic appearance, but her first in the women's 50kg category. Previously, the Haryana wrestler competed in the 53kg category. However, she had to vacate that weight class after young Antim Panghal secured a quota for India in that category, prompting Vinesh to drop down to 50kg, where she won India's selection trials.\n\nThis situation raises questions about the role and responsibility of her support staff, including her renowned Hungarian coach Woller Akos and physio Ashwini Jiwan Patil. Reports suggest that Vinesh gained a couple of kilos by Tuesday night. In a desperate attempt to bring her weight down, her team resorted to extreme measures. Vinesh endured a sleepless night, consuming minimal water, and spent hours exercising at the Olympic Games village gym.\n\nDr. Dinshaw Pardiwala, the Chief Medical Officer of the Indian contingent, confirmed that drastic measures were taken to reduce Vinesh's weight. Pardiwala confirmed that even cut Vinesh's hair on Wednesday morning, but were not able to shed the final 100 grams.\n\n\"Weight cuts cause weakness and energy depletion. This is counterproductive to participation. So most wrestlers will thereafter go in for some amount of energy restoration with limited water and high-energy foods. These are usually given after the weigh-in. The calculation from the nutritionist that is done is athlete-specific. Vinesh's nutritionist felt that the usual amount that she takes -- which is about 1.5kg of nutrition over the day which gives enough to give her energy for the bouts,\" Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Sometimes, there's also a factor of rebound weight gain following competition. Vinesh had three bouts. Hence to prevent any dehydration, some amount of water had to be given. We found that her post-participation weight had increased more than normal.\n\n\"The coach initiated the normal process of weight cut that he always employed with Vinesh. He felt confident that this would help her lose weight,\" he said, adding that all their efforts went in vain.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to lodge a strong protest with the Paris Olympics organizers following Vinesh Phogat's disqualification ahead of her gold medal match. The Prime Minister spoke with IOA chairperson PT Usha, requesting her to explore options to support Phogat's case, sources said.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has confirmed Vinesh's disqualification from the women's 50 kg event, with Cuba's Lopez Yusneylis now set to fight for the gold medal. The investigation will seek to understand why the support staff failed to effectively monitor and manage Vinesh's weight, a question that has left the nation seeking answers.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2022_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Men's_freestyle_57_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2022 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's freestyle 57 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2019_European_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_50_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2019 European Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 50 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antim_Panghal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antim Panghal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_weight_classes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling weight classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_World_Wrestling_Championships_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_50_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 World Wrestling Championships \u2013 Women's freestyle 50 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Usha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

Phogat had previously competed in the 53kg category but switched to 50kg due to another athlete securing a quota. Despite efforts, she weighed over 50kg, eliminating her from the event.While wrestler Vinesh Phogat prepared for her Paris Olympics bouts, she was already wrestling with another challenge: keeping her weight below 50 kg. She was disqualified just hours before the women's 50kg freestyle final after failing to meet the weight criterion. She had been set to lock horns with Sarah Hildebrandt of the United States for the gold medal. The disqualification means she will not receive the silver medal for winning in the semi-final. She was eligible for competition on the opening day but weighed just 100 grams over 50 kg on Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to wrestling rules, if a wrestler fails the weigh-in on either day of the competition (preliminaries, and repechage and final rounds), the wrestler is eliminated from the event.\n\n\"It is with regret that the Indian contingent shares news of the disqualification of Vinesh Phogat from the women's wrestling 50kg class,\" the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said in a statement. \"Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning.\n\nHow Vinesh Phogat's new weight category became a challenge\n\nPhogat had previously competed in the 53kg category but shifted to 50kg due to another wrestler, Antim Panghal, earning an Olympic quota in the 53kg category.\n\nVinesh lost crucial time due to the protest against former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, as per a PTI report. In that period, Panghal secured a quota place in the 53kg category -- Vinesh's pet weight division. The 29-year-old had no option but to switch the weight category to ensure that she does not miss the bus to Olympics. \"I will have to manage my weight a lot better. I have brought myself down to 50kg after very long so I will try and maintain this as much as I can,\" Phogat had told PTI in April. \"It's not easy for me not to put on weight because my muscle mass is very high. Because of that, I gain weight easily. It doesn't matter how fit I am, I still gain weight because I have a lot of muscle mass. I have four months left and every day is very important,\" she said.\n\nThe transition from competing in 53kg to 50kg was laden with challenges. It required her to adjust her training and nutrition significantly. Additionally, facing the demands of a knee surgery and its recovery process tested her mettle.\n\nDropping to the 50kg weight class put additional strain on Phogat's body. The weight-cut process before a match is grueling and drains the body's energy, which would have particularly challenging for her as she approaches 30. With a natural body weight of around 55-56kg, a lot depended on how she managed this change.\n\nThe drastic measures to bring down Phogat's weight\n\nAfter the news of Phogat's disqualification ahead of her gold-medal match came in, Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala, India's Chief Medical Officer at the Paris Olympics, described in detail the drastic steps that were taken to bring her weight down to under 50kg.\n\n\"Wrestlers usually participate in a weight category less than their natural weight. It gives them an advantage because they are fighting against less stronger opponents. The process of weight-cut prior to the weigh-in in the morning involves a calculated restriction of food and water, and besides this the athlete needs to sweat, and that sweating is done with sauna and exercise,\" Dr. Pardiwala said in a video shared by the Sports Authority of India.\n\n\"This weight-cut has the benefit of putting you in a lighter weight category but does cause weakness and energy depletion; and this is counter-productive to participation. So most wrestlers thereafter will go for some amount of energy restoration with limited water and high-energy foods, and these are usually given after the weigh-in,\" he said.\n\n\"The calucation done by the nutritionist is athlete-specific; and Vinesh's nutriotionist felt that the usual amount she takes is about 1.5 kg in total over the day, which gives her enough energy for the bouts. Sometimes there is also factor of a rebound weight gain following competition,\" he said.\n\n\"Vinesh had three bouts (on Tuesday) and hence to prevent any dehydration some amount of water had to be given. We found that her post-participation weight increased more than normal and the coach initiated the normal process of weight-cut that he has always employed with Vinesh. This is something that has worked with her over a long period of time. He was confident that this would be achieved and overnight we went ahead with the weight-cut procedure,\" Dr. Pardiwala aid.\n\n\"However, in the morning we found that despite all of our efforts, her weight was 100gm over her 50kg category and hence she was disqualified.\" \"We had tried all drastic measures throughout the night, including cutting her hair, shortening her clothes. Despite all of this, we could not make that 50kg weight category,\" he said.\n\n(WIth inputs from TOI and PTI)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_50_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2019 World Wrestling Championships \u2013 Women's freestyle 50 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Hildebrandt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Hildebrandt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repechage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Repechage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antim_Panghal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antim Panghal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Panghal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Panghal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brij_Bhushan_Sharan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_weight_classes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling weight classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Authority_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Authority of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Sumo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Sumo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112350718,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-91956,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798108", "eventUri": "eng-9798108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Let's take a look into the specifics of Olympic weigh-ins, the two-day event format, and the reality of weight cutting for wrestlers.\n\nNo, there was no 2kg allowance for Vinesh in making weight in the 50kg category at the Olympics. Unlike other UWW or international tournaments, the Olympics follow strict weight restrictions without the 2kg weigh-in tolerance.\n\nVinesh and her team made extreme efforts to meet the weight requirement, including spending the entire night running and using the sauna. Despite these efforts, she fell short by a little over 100 grams. The account does not specify whether cutting hair or donating blood was considered or attempted, but it highlights that she did everything possible within her capacity and time constraints to cut the weight.\n\nVinesh's support staff, including her coach and nutritionist, were working tirelessly to help her meet the weight requirement. They monitored her weight closely, managed her diet and hydration, and supported her through the extreme measures taken to cut weight. Despite their efforts, Vinesh's weight bounced back after even a small meal, making it challenging to maintain the required weight.\n\nWrestling switched from a single-day to a two-day event as part of a series of changes introduced by the UWW in late 2017. These changes aimed to curb doping and came into effect in major tournaments, including the World Championships in 2018. The Rio Olympics was the last major international tournament to feature wrestling as a single-day event.\n\nNo, declaring an injury would not have allowed Vinesh to retain her medal. According to Article 11 of the United World Wrestling's rule book, an athlete who fails to make the weight cut is eliminated from the event and ranked last, without rank. This rule meant that despite her victories, Vinesh was disqualified and stripped of her achievements in the tournament.\n\nFirst Weigh-In: Wrestlers have 30 minutes to make weight, during which they can step on the scale multiple times. They are weighed in their singlets and checked for contagious diseases and short fingernails.\n\nSecond Weigh-In: For those competing on the second day, the weigh-in window is reduced to 15 minutes, with no tolerance for weight deviation. Wrestlers must make the required weight again or face disqualification.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_cutting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weight cutting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_World_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United World Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sauna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wrestling_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Wrestling Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Sumo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Sumo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/03/vinesh-phogat-ians-feature-2024-03-0390ea9d057fa92f1f55ed831104494e-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798108", "eventUri": "eng-9798108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

She gained 2.7 kg after her semi-final bout against Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, which led to the drastic attempt to reduce her weight by limiting food and water intake, and through intensive steaming and sauna sessions.\n\nPardiwala lamented the lack of time, stating that with just a few more hours, they could have achieved the weight requirement. Following Phogat's disqualification, immediate steps were taken to rehydrate her through intravenous fluids.

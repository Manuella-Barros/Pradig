I went to the grocery store and I wasn\u2019t asked about the back ribs on sale. I went to the driving range and nobody asked how I was hitting it. I went to the local deli and wasn\u2019t asked which sandwich I wanted. But everywhere I go, I am asked about Mitch Marner. Is he staying? Is he going? What\u2019s he thinking? It is the talk of the town. All the time. Not the struggling Blue Jays. Not the Maple Leafs with the same old players and another new head coach. Not the Toronto team that quietly and quickly exited from the PWHL playoffs. Not the new WNBA franchise. Not what\u2019s left of the Stanley Cup playoffs and a Canadian team still alive. Not the Argos quarterback suspended for half a season. It is all Marner all the time around Toronto. You couldn\u2019t find him on the ice in the playoffs and you can\u2019t escape him off the ice now that the Leafs season is over. This is the conversation as barbecues light. This is what\u2019s heard on outdoor patios. I was at a concert Friday night: Nobody asked what I thought of the music. A few people asked: What\u2019s going on with Marner? The Maple Leafs have a presentation to make. The Marner camp, with a no-trade clause in a contract and one year remaining on it, completely controls the circumstance. If Marner wants to leave, they can make that possible. If the Leafs don\u2019t want him to leave, management can promise to make life rather miserable for him in his last year in Toronto. Until then, it\u2019s speculation and more speculation. With online nobodies making up trades possibilities that don\u2019t make any sense. And until then, a haircut is no longer just a haircut in the summer. It\u2019s another chance to talk hockey, to talk Marner. And while that is going so, can you take a little off the side? THIS AND THAT Sheldon Keefe coached a Maple Leafs team that had uncertain goaltending, a mediocre defence and a lack of grit, along with a lot of offensive talent, up front. And still it finished with 102 points. Now he takes over a New Jersey team with uncertain goaltending, a mediocre defence and a lack of grit along along with offensive talent up front. The Devils finished with 81 points. Look for that number to change next season \u2026 Leafs management truly wants to understand why Joseph Woll has had so many different injuries for five straight seasons, after having almost none for three years in college and two years of junior hockey. They view Woll at the talent level of a No. 1 NHL goaltender. But it\u2019s a dangerous game they are playing trying to predict his future. Can they trust Woll to play 50 games? And if so, who plays the other 32? \u2026 And the question remains: Is he incapable of pulling a Grant Fuhr or other game-munchers and popping his shoulder back in and continuing on? \u2026 In his playing days, the Hall of Famer Guy Carbonneau was something of a yapper on the ice. He was once asked by Michael Farber for the best comeback he\u2019d ever heard? He said it came from Craig Berube, the newly named coach of the Leafs, who told him: \u201cShut up, Rene Levesque.\u201d \u2026 Tie Domi may be able to say something almost no hockey parent can manage \u2014 but many have certainly thought about it: He\u2019s punched his son\u2019s coach in the mouth. And in other places. Numerous times \u2026 Berube fought 303 times, regular season, in the NHL. One fewer bout than Bob Probert. The most fights in NHL history: 1. Domi; 2. Tiger Williams \u2026 Berube is the latest former Leafs player to coach the team. The most recent examples: Randy Carlyle, Ron Wilson, Pat Quinn, George Armstrong and Dan Maloney. Berube played only 40 games in Toronto before being sent to Calgary as a part of the steal that was the Doug Gilmour trade. What would the Leafs history of the past 30 years have been without Cliff Fletcher deals for Gilmour and, after that, for Mats Sundin? HEAR AND THERE Tampa re-acquired the expensive defenceman Ryan McDonagh recently from Nashville for a rather basic reason: The Lightning hadn\u2019t won a playoff series since McDonagh was sent to the Predators in a salary-cap saving deal. They believe McDonagh left a massive hole in their team, on and off the ice. He may not be the player he once was: But at 35, he\u2019s still that person Tampa wants in their lineup \u2026 This is unusual: GM Don Waddell is leaving a great Carolina team for a not-so-great team in Columbus. That doesn\u2019t happen often. But is he going alone? He may not be. Some NHL GMs believe Edmonton boss Ken Holland could be heading to Columbus along with Waddell and Holland\u2019s son, Brad. Waddell was assistant GM to Holland on the \u201998 Stanley Cup-champion Red Wings. The two have been close ever since. If it happens, Waddell and Holland would be in senior hockey positions and Brad Holland would be learning the GM\u2019s job alongside two experienced successful mentors \u2026 Should Marner choose to leave Toronto and the Leafs need to replace some offence, a wise hockey man suggests they consider signing Patrick Kane, who had 47 points in 50 games in Detroit. Kane still has some offensive juice in his game and would love the idea of playing this close to his home in Buffalo \u2026 Why wouldn\u2019t Louisville police drop charges against golfer Scottie Scheffler? What do they have to prove by continuing with them? \u2026Niners\u2019 Nick Bosa on the calmness of his quarterback, Brock Purdy: \u201cHe reminds me of Scottie Scheffler, except he didn\u2019t get arrested.\u201d \u2026 When the new NBA television numbers come in, player salaries will go through the roof. Within two years, expect Shai GIlgeous-Alexander to be making $72 million US, or just under $100 million Canadian a year. Which means he\u2019ll be making five times a year more than Auston Matthews will be paid with the Leafs. SCENE AND HEARD Whose idea was that, inviting the prime minister nobody likes, alongside the premier nobody cares for, and the mayor we\u2019d rather be without, all to be part of the announcement of the WNBA coming to Toronto? I wanted to photoshop all three out of the glad-handing welcome-to-Toronto shot \u2026 The betting is that Kyle Lowry will be among a group of Larry Tanenbaum\u2019s minority partners with the expansion WNBA franchise in Toronto. Lowry\u2019s career earnings in the NBA: $360 million dollars Canadian \u2026 My choice for the WNBA name: Toronto 6ix \u2026 Yes, that was the actor, Ashton Kutcher, waiting courtside in Los Angeles post-game Friday night for a hug from Caitlin Clark. Turns out, Kutcher is an Iowa grad and a longtime supporter of Clark. His young daughter started crying from joy upon meeting Clark. It was quite the scene \u2026 The snide side-comments about Clark\u2019s first days in the WNBA smack of petty smallness. It may not be easy to define just who Clark is and what she is doing so far in the league, but there is no doubt about this: What she has done already for women\u2019s sport, for women\u2019s professional sport, for the changing television ratings and economics in just every way has been over-the-moon incredible and impossible \u2026 And no woman in team sport has ever been this financially powerful before \u2026 Said LeBron James on Clark: \u201cPeople need to realize, the Indiana Fever \u2014 this is the second year in a row they had the No. 1 pick. Do y\u2019all know what that means? That means they\u2019re not that good \u2026 I\u2019m rooting for Caitlin because I\u2019ve been in that seat before. I\u2019ve walked that road. I hope she kills it \u2026 The one thing that I love that she\u2019s bringing to her sport: More people want to watch. More people want to tune in. I saw, for the first time, they had a chartered plane. For the first time in their league history, they flew private. That should be celebrated in its own right.\u201d \u2026 One thing that will have to be accomplished between now and the 2026 WNBA season in Toronto: Find a way to fix the entrance and exit point at the Coca-Cola Coliseum. Right now, that\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen \u2026 How angry would you be if you paid huge dollars to see Lionel Messi play in Vancouver and he doesn\u2019t show up? It\u2019s not unlike Raptors fans who paid premium-seat money for the Golden State Warriors a few years back and showed up to see that Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all out of the lineup that night. AND ANOTHER THING This is the outfield the Blue Jays apparently believe in: George Springer (.188) in right. Daulton Varsho (.208) in left. Kevin Kiermaier (.226) in centre. All of them great defenders. The expansion outfield of 1977 with the 54-win Blue Jays, with Gary Woods (.216) in centre, Otto Velez (.256) in right and Alvis Woods (.284) in left, hit better than this. They weren\u2019t great in the field but they hit better than this bunch \u2026 The timing of the return of the home run jacket was rather fascinating by the Jays. Line up against the worst team in the American League and try to hit home runs. What\u2019s really missing from this Jays season: A schedule with 162 games against the White Sox \u2026 The Jays have hit 43 home runs this season and given up 64. In the great year of 2015 \u2014 the only division-winning season since 1993 \u2014 the Jays hit 232 home runs and gave up 173 \u2026 And Mark Shapiro was upset that Alex Anthopoulos traded away Daniel Norris that season. Which is all you really need to know about Shapiro. In his last 13 seasons with the Guardians, the team won one playoff round and missed the post-season 11 times in the American League Central, which is hardly the AL East \u2026 The Jays continue to waste what may be the deepest starting rotation in baseball \u2026 The strange imbalance of this season: The Jays are way behind division stalwarts such as New York and Baltimore but are still rather close to the wild-card spot in the American League. Which tells you how little depth there is in the AL. It\u2019s worse in the National League, where you can probably qualify for a playoff spot by winning 85-86 games \u2026 Pitching phenom Paul Skenes has 21 strikeouts in his first 16 innings pitched in the big leagues with the Pittsburgh Pirates \u2026 Luis Arraez, hitting .397 since being traded to San Diego, won the NL batting title last year in Miami and the AL batting crown the year before in Minnesota. He could become the first player to win three batting titles with three different teams in three years. He\u2019s the modern day Rod Carew \u2026 Mississauga\u2019s Josh Naylor leads AL first basemen in home runs, RBIs, slugging and OPS through the first third of the season. In another year when hitting numbers are sadly dropping, Naylor\u2019s numbers remain impressive \u2026 There\u2019s no such thing as a top rookie for the hockey playoffs, but if there were, it would go to Luke Gazdik, who has comfortably found a voice and a place on the normally uneven Sportsnet panels \u2026 The marginalizing of coaches in the NBA has hit the ridiculous stage. The Cleveland Cavaliers win 99 games the past two seasons and fire coach J.B. Bickerstaff \u2026 Happy birthday to Roman Reigns (39), David Pastrnak (28), Norm Powell (31), Micah Parsons (25), Rick Wamsley (65), Nick Fotiu (72), Ben Zobrist (43), Pat Riggin (65), Shawne Merriman (40), Andrew Sznajder (57), Dan Pastorini (75), Caroline Ouellette (45) and Matt Murray (30) \u2026 And hey, whatever became of Craig Ludwig? ssimmons@postmedia.com X \u2014 @simmonsteve Share this Story : SIMMONS SAYS: The summer of Mitch Marner is already upon us ... everywhere Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr", "summary": "I went to the barber shop and I wasn\u2019t asked about my hair.

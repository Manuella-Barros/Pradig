It had been hoped that the super-middleweight would face Keeler on the eagerly anticipated Conlan Boxing show at the SSE Arena on August 3. Conlna Boxing confirmed on Tuesday that Tyrone McKenna will feature on the bill, in a rematch against Mohamed Mimoune who the 'Mighty Celt' claimed a controversial win over back in 2020. A number of other intriguing bouts are also set to be announced for the card, including three fighters who are part of McCrory's Hammer Boxing Management stable.

Also set for the show is Owen O'Neill who will face Dylan Moran in a massive all-island clash, while emerging prospect Theo Allen will make his pro debut after signing up with McCrory. \"I now have Gerard, Owen and Theo Allen who is a new signing for Hammer Boxing Management. Theo is a brilliant prospect,\" McCrory told Belfast Live. \"He is a two-time Ulster Elite finalist and has fought in the Irish Elites. He was a very good amateur and I am excited to see where he goes in boxing. And now he is going to make his pro debut on a massive Conlan Boxing bill at the SSE Arena. \"We also have Owen O'Neill who will fight Dylan Moran, hopefully for the Irish title. We will also have Gerard Hughes in a rematch with Rudy Farrell. \"The Hughes-Farrell one is exciting. They had that draw at the SSE last year and there was controversy surrounding it. Rudy and his team thought they won the fight. \"But there is a good rivalry there and they both sell tickets. Gerard has been with me for four of his fights and he has fought at the SSE, Ulster Hall and Falls Park. So he is getting great opportunities. \"This will be Owen's first fight at the SSE. His last fight was his first with me and that was at the Ulster Hall. He had a frustrating fight last time against Edgar Kemsky, but this one should be better. \"It will be for an Irish title against Dylan Moran who is a bit of a name in Irish boxing. He sparred Conor McGregor and fought Florian Marku on a pay-per-view card, so it is a tough fight for Owen.\" McCrory added: \"My relationship with Conlan Boxing has been brilliant so far, and they have given my boxers plenty of opportunities. Now it is about sitting down and thinking where I want to take the management side of my career. \"Do I want to expand, or keep a small, tight group I can give everything to.\" Meanwhile, McCrory says time is running out to confirm his own name on the bill. The 35-year-old hasn't fought since suffering his first loss as a professional against Edgar Berlanga in Florida back in February. He said: \"I was hoping to join the lads on the SSE bill, but it is 50-50 at the minute. I will fight again, and I would love to fight on August 3, but I don't know where that's at right now. \"We had hoped to fight Luke Keeler, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen. The feeling I am getting at the minute that it is 50-50, but it is only nine weeks away and a fight like that needs to be made soon. \"If I am going to compete I need to be fit and ready. And August 3 isn't that far away. If I get the green light I will be ready to go, but we need a decision soon. \"The aim is to return around that date, but we will see. I know Keeler was keen on the fight, but then I heard he was struggling with an injury and August 3 might be too soon. \"It is a fight that really got the Irish public interested, and got me interested. He had a win over me in the amateurs and has boxed at a high level. He has fought for a world title. So it is a fight that would attract a lot of interest, but unfortunately it looks like it might not happen now. \"It is about finding the right fight now. This show has been announced this week with Tyrone fighting Mimoune in a rematch. And there are some great undercard fights set to be announced. \"But as for me, I am not sure.\" Sign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox", "summary": "Padraig McCrory was being lined up for a fight against Luke Keeler at the SSE Arena", "url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/boxing/padraig-mccrory-offers-fight-return-29258071", "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article28687308.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Padraig-McCrory.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:18:11", "author": "Gareth Fullerton", "authors": ["Gareth Fullerton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.122}

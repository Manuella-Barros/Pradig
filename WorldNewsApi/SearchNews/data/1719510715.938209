The NOG Energy Week, themed \u2018Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment. Meeting Energy Demand\u2019, will explore emerging business contingencies, sharing a common goal with the President\u2019s directive to build systems that will eliminate investment barriers in Nigeria\u2019s energy sector. Following the Executive Order by President Bola Tinubu, it is thought this will shed light on the government\u2019s strategies for strengthening Nigeria\u2019s energy sector, particularly regarding fiscal incentives for non-associated gas, midstream, and deepwater developments, which offers promising opportunities for the development of gas resources in Nigeria. Historically, industry stakeholders at NOG Energy Week have stressed the need for clearer policy direction for non-associated gas exploration and production. As a major contributor to Africa\u2019s oil and gas potential, Nigeria has substantial natural gas reserves, ranking as the ninth largest in the world. Significantly, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) announced that Nigeria\u2019s gas reserves currently stand at 208 trillion cubic feet, with the potential to increase production to more than 5 billion cubic feet per day. The Executive Order addresses the much-needed policy direction that will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions for funding, advanced gas activities, and infrastructure development. Speaking at a retreat organised to create the roadmap for achieving the targets set by President Tinubu, the minister of state for Petroleum Resources (Gas), Mr Ekperikpe Ekpo, stated that, \u201censuring the widespread penetration of gas nationwide is essential to realising its full potential as a transition fuel. This entails not only increasing domestic gas production but also promoting the adoption of gas as a cleaner alternative for power generation, industrial processes, transportation, and household use. Initiatives such as the \u2018Decade of Gas Initiative\u2019 are instrumental in driving gas utilisation across various sectors through targeted interventions, infrastructure development, and policy incentives.\u201d The NOG Energy Week 2024 will feature various presentations, panel discussions, and networking sessions on funding projects, the significance of natural gas, increasing oil and gas production, as well as strategies to overcome challenges in the industry overall for economic growth.

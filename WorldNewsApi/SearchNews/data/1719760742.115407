Connie and Rob Turner, both 79, were said to be 'broken' after their three-bed home was destroyed in a blaze following the freak incident on Sunday evening (May 26). The pair had been watching TV in their kitchen when the bolt hit the property with a \u201chorrific bang\u201d at around 4.30pm. A huge fire then engulfed the roof of the building, with Rob, who is disabled, needing to be rescued by neighbours.

Connie's daughter, Caroline Moore, 54, described the scene as looking like a disaster movie. She said: \u201cIt was just like going onto a film set. I jumped out of my car, left the engine running and the door wide open, and just ran to the ambulance. I didn\u2019t know at this point what I was going to find. \u201cThey were devasted. They were both in tears. My stepdad is disabled so the neighbours managed to get him out. And my mum, her blood pressure was over 200. It was just devastating to see them like that.\u201d Caroline said the pair were brought to a hospital, where they were found to have no physical injuries, and have since been given a flat to stay in at a nearby farm. But she said they had been left \u2018mentally scarred\u2019 by the traumatic incident in Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, East Yorkshire. Caroline added: \u201cOne minute they are fine and the next they just break down \u2013 thinking of the things they have lost... They\u2019ve got a lifetime of memories in there. \"They have no injuries, they were released the following day, but it\u2019s mentally scarring, it\u2019s just horrendous.\" Speaking about the strike at the home where she has lived since the early 80s, Connie said: \"I can\u2019t believe it. We\u2019ve lost absolutely everything. We have got nothing.\u201d Caroline, also from Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, said Connie, a retired hairdresser, and Rob, a former window cleaner, had been relaxing together when the lightning struck. She said the sky had suddenly turned very dark and there was both hail and heavy rain as a thunderstorm loomed over the beautiful Yorkshire village. Caroline said: \u201cIt was Sunday tea time. I think it struck around 4.30pm. They were sitting in their kitchen area watching the TV. There was just an almighty bang. It had become really dark, and then the rain started really heavy. And there were hail stones as well. \u201cI don\u2019t really think they fully understood what it was. It was just a horrific, horrific bang. My mum, bless her, ran outside to look at the neighbour's house because she thought it was the one next door. And then she realised it was her own house. \u201cThere was smoke starting to billow down the stairs and through the hallway. I think it struck the roof over the bedroom at the back, that\u2019s what we can gather anyway. \u201cBut it\u2019s wiped it out. When lightning travels, it needs to find an exit. It just travelled throughout the house.\u201d Caroline said she had already spoken to the couple\u2019s home insurers, who thankfully said they would cover the damage to the property. But she still doesn\u2019t know if it will need to be rebuilt from the ground up \u2013 and guessed that it could cost in excess of \u00a3200,000 for the work. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve no idea what actually will happen. But they\u2019ve said it's covered, and they\u2019ve also been covered for alternative accommodation, so once they\u2019ve found them something suitable they\u2019ll be moved there. \u201cIt could definitely be a few hundred thousand pounds.\u201d Supportive locals who heard about the strike have since rallied around the couple. And they have now set up a donation page to help with their expenses, which has so far raised just under \u00a36,000.", "summary": "The couple's home was struck by lightning", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/they-were-sitting-kitchen-watching-29258045", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29257513.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_tearful-pension-1191973.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:52:08", "author": "SWNS", "authors": ["SWNS"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.62}

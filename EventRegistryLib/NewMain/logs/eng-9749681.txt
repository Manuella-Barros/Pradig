But gone was the IKEA furniture from the old motel.\n\nNow the All-Movie Hotel is outfitted with post-production facilities, editing suites, recording rooms and screening spaces. The hybrid property will soon host film nerds and production companies alike.\n\nThe \"Godfather\" director originally bought the hotel in 2022 for $4.35 million to host the production of \"Megalopolis\" -- a self-funded, $120 million film starring Adam Driver as an architect in a futuristic New York City. Amid rumors of production drama, the movie garnered harsh reviews after its debut in Cannes, and The Associated Press reported some critics called it a \"disaster.\"\n\nCoppola's hotel collection, The Family Coppola Hideaways, has properties in Belize, Guatemala, Argentina, and Italy. The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book. In Coppola's room, a round gray couch with spheric pillows sits in front of a king sized bed and among leather director-style chairs The \"his and hers\" bathrooms are joined by a shower, inspired by a lodge Coppola stayed at in Guatemala.\n\n\"I envisioned The All-Movie Hotel to be a space where filmmakers could truly immerse themselves in the creative process, fostering a collaborative environment that inspires innovation,\" Coppola said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nPotted succulents imported from Italy line the outdoor walkway and textured walls. Beyond the colorful doors, each room has its own quirks. One has bunk beds, designed for interns and children of production staff. Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers. Most of the rooms connect, which Driver appreciated, since he stayed in a room adjacent to his assistant.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as a top production hub since 2005, when the state enacted tax breaks for the industry. Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on

Soon, it'll be open for business", "body": "PEACHTREE CITY, Ga. -- Two years ago, Francis Ford Coppola stopped at Georgia Film Academy on the hunt for apprentices for his upcoming film, \"Megalopolis.\"\n\nJordan Holifield, then a 23-year-old student, did a double-take when he saw one of the application questions -- did he know how to disassemble IKEA furniture?\n\nMonths later, Holifield, one of four selected apprentices, pulled up to Coppola's hotel -- which was originally a Days Inn motel. But gone was the IKEA furniture from the old motel.\n\nNow the All-Movie Hotel is outfitted with post-production facilities, editing suites, recording rooms and screening spaces. The hybrid property will soon host film nerds and production companies alike.\n\nThe \"Godfather\" director originally bought the hotel in 2022 for $4.35 million to host the production of \"Megalopolis\" -- a self-funded, $120 million film starring Adam Driver as an architect in a futuristic New York City. Amid rumors of production drama, the movie garnered harsh reviews after its debut in Cannes, and The Associated Press reported some critics called it a \"disaster.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

JD Vance of Ohio, a once-fierce critic turned loyal ally, as his GOP running mate\n\nCoppola's hotel collection, The Family Coppola Hideaways, has properties in Belize, Guatemala, Argentina, and Italy. The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book. In Coppola's room, a round gray couch with spheric pillows sits in front of a king sized bed and among leather director-style chairs The \"his and hers\" bathrooms are joined by a shower, inspired by a lodge Coppola stayed at in Guatemala.\n\n\"I envisioned The All-Movie Hotel to be a space where filmmakers could truly immerse themselves in the creative process, fostering a collaborative environment that inspires innovation,\" Coppola said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nPotted succulents imported from Italy line the outdoor walkway and textured walls. Beyond the colorful doors, each room has its own quirks. One has bunk beds, designed for interns and children of production staff. Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers. Most of the rooms connect, which Driver appreciated, since he stayed in a room adjacent to his assistant.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as a top production hub since 2005, when the state enacted tax breaks for the industry. Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Soon, it'll be open for business", "body": "PEACHTREE CITY, Ga. -- Two years ago, Francis Ford Coppola stopped at Georgia Film Academy on the hunt for apprentices for his upcoming film, \"Megalopolis.\"\n\nJordan Holifield, then a 23-year-old student, did a double-take when he saw one of the application questions -- did he know how to disassemble IKEA furniture?\n\nMonths later, Holifield, one of four selected apprentices, pulled up to Coppola's hotel -- which was originally a Days Inn motel. But gone was the IKEA furniture from the old motel.\n\nNow the All-Movie Hotel is outfitted with post-production facilities, editing suites, recording rooms and screening spaces. The hybrid property will soon host film nerds and production companies alike.\n\nThe \"Godfather\" director originally bought the hotel in 2022 for $4.35 million to host the production of \"Megalopolis\" -- a self-funded, $120 million film starring Adam Driver as an architect in a futuristic New York City. Amid rumors of production drama, the movie garnered harsh reviews after its debut in Cannes, and The Associated Press reported some critics called it a \"disaster.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book. In Coppola's room, a round gray couch with spheric pillows sits in front of a king sized bed and among leather director-style chairs The \"his and hers\" bathrooms are joined by a shower, inspired by a lodge Coppola stayed at in Guatemala.\n\n\"I envisioned The All-Movie Hotel to be a space where filmmakers could truly immerse themselves in the creative process, fostering a collaborative environment that inspires innovation,\" Coppola said.\n\nPotted succulents imported from Italy line the outdoor walkway and textured walls. Beyond the colorful doors, each room has its own quirks. One has bunk beds, designed for interns and children of production staff. Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers. Most of the rooms connect, which Driver appreciated, since he stayed in a room adjacent to his assistant.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as a top production hub since 2005, when the state enacted tax breaks for the industry. Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute \"Maxxxine\" Movies in a Minute \"Despicable Me 4\" Movies in a Minute \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Thelma\" Movies in a Minute: \"Inside Out 2\" Movies in a Minute \"Bad Boys: Ride or Die\" Movies in a Minute: \"Jim Henson Idea Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Summer Camp\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Blue Angels\" Movies in a Minute: \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Fall Guy\" Movies in a Minute: \"Challengers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book.

Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers.

Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Soon, it'll be open for business", "body": "PEACHTREE CITY, Ga. -- Two years ago, Francis Ford Coppola stopped at Georgia Film Academy on the hunt for apprentices for his upcoming film, \"Megalopolis.\"\n\nJordan Holifield, then a 23-year-old student, did a double-take when he saw one of the application questions -- did he know how to disassemble IKEA furniture?\n\nMonths later, Holifield, one of four selected apprentices, pulled up to Coppola's hotel -- which was originally a Days Inn motel. But gone was the IKEA furniture from the old motel.\n\nNow the All-Movie Hotel is outfitted with post-production facilities, editing suites, recording rooms and screening spaces. The hybrid property will soon host film nerds and production companies alike.\n\nThe \"Godfather\" director originally bought the hotel in 2022 for $4.35 million to host the production of \"Megalopolis\" -- a self-funded, $120 million film starring Adam Driver as an architect in a futuristic New York City. Amid rumors of production drama, the movie garnered harsh reviews after its debut in Cannes, and The Associated Press reported some critics called it a \"disaster.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book. In Coppola's room, a round gray couch with spheric pillows sits in front of a king sized bed and among leather director-style chairs The \"his and hers\" bathrooms are joined by a shower, inspired by a lodge Coppola stayed at in Guatemala.\n\n\"I envisioned The All-Movie Hotel to be a space where filmmakers could truly immerse themselves in the creative process, fostering a collaborative environment that inspires innovation,\" Coppola said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nPotted succulents imported from Italy line the outdoor walkway and textured walls. Beyond the colorful doors, each room has its own quirks. One has bunk beds, designed for interns and children of production staff. Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers. Most of the rooms connect, which Driver appreciated, since he stayed in a room adjacent to his assistant.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as a top production hub since 2005, when the state enacted tax breaks for the industry. Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book. In Coppola's room, a round gray couch with spheric pillows sits in front of a king sized bed and among leather director-style chairs The \"his and hers\" bathrooms are joined by a shower, inspired by a lodge Coppola stayed at in Guatemala.\n\n\"I envisioned The All-Movie Hotel to be a space where filmmakers could truly immerse themselves in the creative process, fostering a collaborative environment that inspires innovation,\" Coppola said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nPotted succulents imported from Italy line the outdoor walkway and textured walls. Beyond the colorful doors, each room has its own quirks. One has bunk beds, designed for interns and children of production staff. Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers. Most of the rooms connect, which Driver appreciated, since he stayed in a room adjacent to his assistant.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as a top production hub since 2005, when the state enacted tax breaks for the industry. Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.

But gone was the IKEA furniture from the old motel.\n\nNow the All-Movie Hotel is outfitted with post-production facilities, editing suites, recording rooms and screening spaces. The hybrid property will soon host film nerds and production companies alike.\n\nThe \"Godfather\" director originally bought the hotel in 2022 for $4.35 million to host the production of \"Megalopolis\" -- a self-funded, $120 million film starring Adam Driver as an architect in a futuristic New York City.

Soon, it'll be open for business", "body": "PEACHTREE CITY, Ga. -- Two years ago, Francis Ford Coppola stopped at Georgia Film Academy on the hunt for apprentices for his upcoming film, \"Megalopolis.\"\n\nJordan Holifield, then a 23-year-old student, did a double-take when he saw one of the application questions -- did he know how to disassemble IKEA furniture?\n\nMonths later, Holifield, one of four selected apprentices, pulled up to Coppola's hotel -- which was originally a Days Inn motel. But gone was the IKEA furniture from the old motel.\n\nNow the All-Movie Hotel is outfitted with post-production facilities, editing suites, recording rooms and screening spaces. The hybrid property will soon host film nerds and production companies alike.\n\nThe \"Godfather\" director originally bought the hotel in 2022 for $4.35 million to host the production of \"Megalopolis\" -- a self-funded, $120 million film starring Adam Driver as an architect in a futuristic New York City. Amid rumors of production drama, the movie garnered harsh reviews after its debut in Cannes, and The Associated Press reported some critics called it a \"disaster.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book. In Coppola's room, a round gray couch with spheric pillows sits in front of a king sized bed and among leather director-style chairs The \"his and hers\" bathrooms are joined by a shower, inspired by a lodge Coppola stayed at in Guatemala.\n\n\"I envisioned The All-Movie Hotel to be a space where filmmakers could truly immerse themselves in the creative process, fostering a collaborative environment that inspires innovation,\" Coppola said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nPotted succulents imported from Italy line the outdoor walkway and textured walls. Beyond the colorful doors, each room has its own quirks. One has bunk beds, designed for interns and children of production staff. Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers. Most of the rooms connect, which Driver appreciated, since he stayed in a room adjacent to his assistant.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as a top production hub since 2005, when the state enacted tax breaks for the industry. Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Soon, it'll be open for business", "body": "PEACHTREE CITY, Ga. -- Two years ago, Francis Ford Coppola stopped at Georgia Film Academy on the hunt for apprentices for his upcoming film, \"Megalopolis.\"\n\nJordan Holifield, then a 23-year-old student, did a double-take when he saw one of the application questions -- did he know how to disassemble IKEA furniture?\n\nMonths later, Holifield, one of four selected apprentices, pulled up to Coppola's hotel -- which was originally a Days Inn motel. But gone was the IKEA furniture from the old motel.\n\nNow the All-Movie Hotel is outfitted with post-production facilities, editing suites, recording rooms and screening spaces. The hybrid property will soon host film nerds and production companies alike.\n\nThe \"Godfather\" director originally bought the hotel in 2022 for $4.35 million to host the production of \"Megalopolis\" -- a self-funded, $120 million film starring Adam Driver as an architect in a futuristic New York City. Amid rumors of production drama, the movie garnered harsh reviews after its debut in Cannes, and The Associated Press reported some critics called it a \"disaster.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book. In Coppola's room, a round gray couch with spheric pillows sits in front of a king sized bed and among leather director-style chairs The \"his and hers\" bathrooms are joined by a shower, inspired by a lodge Coppola stayed at in Guatemala.\n\n\"I envisioned The All-Movie Hotel to be a space where filmmakers could truly immerse themselves in the creative process, fostering a collaborative environment that inspires innovation,\" Coppola said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nPotted succulents imported from Italy line the outdoor walkway and textured walls. Beyond the colorful doors, each room has its own quirks. One has bunk beds, designed for interns and children of production staff. Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers. Most of the rooms connect, which Driver appreciated, since he stayed in a room adjacent to his assistant.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as a top production hub since 2005, when the state enacted tax breaks for the industry. Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Soon, it'll be open for business", "body": "PEACHTREE CITY, Ga. -- Two years ago, Francis Ford Coppola stopped at Georgia Film Academy on the hunt for apprentices for his upcoming film, \"Megalopolis.\"\n\nJordan Holifield, then a 23-year-old student, did a double-take when he saw one of the application questions -- did he know how to disassemble IKEA furniture?\n\nMonths later, Holifield, one of four selected apprentices, pulled up to Coppola's hotel -- which was originally a Days Inn motel. But gone was the IKEA furniture from the old motel.\n\nNow the All-Movie Hotel is outfitted with post-production facilities, editing suites, recording rooms and screening spaces. The hybrid property will soon host film nerds and production companies alike.\n\nThe \"Godfather\" director originally bought the hotel in 2022 for $4.35 million to host the production of \"Megalopolis\" -- a self-funded, $120 million film starring Adam Driver as an architect in a futuristic New York City. Amid rumors of production drama, the movie garnered harsh reviews after its debut in Cannes, and The Associated Press reported some critics called it a \"disaster.\"\n\nCoppola's hotel collection, The Family Coppola Hideaways, has properties in Belize, Guatemala, Argentina, and Italy. The All-Movie Hotel is Coppola's first property in the United States, opening July 25, in Peachtree City, just under an hour south of Atlanta's downtown.\n\nThere are 27 rooms with prices ranging from $170 to $470 per night.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel's architecture mirrors its former days as a motel. But props from Coppola's movies scattered throughout the property add flair, such as old school \"Godfather\" pinball machines in the lobby. An imposing golden hawk figurine, which can be seen in the \"Megalopolis\" trailer, is perched outside the pool-area fence.\n\nCoppola himself, along with Driver, stayed in rooms that will soon be available to book. In Coppola's room, a round gray couch with spheric pillows sits in front of a king sized bed and among leather director-style chairs The \"his and hers\" bathrooms are joined by a shower, inspired by a lodge Coppola stayed at in Guatemala.\n\n\"I envisioned The All-Movie Hotel to be a space where filmmakers could truly immerse themselves in the creative process, fostering a collaborative environment that inspires innovation,\" Coppola said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nPotted succulents imported from Italy line the outdoor walkway and textured walls. Beyond the colorful doors, each room has its own quirks. One has bunk beds, designed for interns and children of production staff. Another is Japan-themed and decorated with photographs of notable Japanese filmmakers. Most of the rooms connect, which Driver appreciated, since he stayed in a room adjacent to his assistant.\n\nGeorgia has emerged as a top production hub since 2005, when the state enacted tax breaks for the industry. Tax credits for filmmakers increased dramatically in 2008 and are expected to reach $1.35 billion this year. The tax incentive supported $5.54 billion in economic activity in 2022, according to the Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition.\n\nFilmmakers work closely with an already well-developed network of rental properties, hotels and house crews, said Kelly Moore, executive director of Georgia Screen Entertainment Coalition. But she said the All-Movie Hotel is \"a really interesting addition that meets a niche filmmaker need\" for an all-in-one communal facility for post-production.\n\nThe industry's growth in the state has slowed, with an estimated 40% fewer productions this year compared to last year, according to WSB-TV. But Moore is confident that Coppola's choice to use Georgia's infrastructure shows that its location is still a creative hub.\n\nThe hotel \"really indicates there's a desire to do a full ecosystem of production in Georgia,\" Moore said.\n\nOn the final day of filming \"Megalopolis,\" the crew gathered for their last meal in the farmhouse-style kitchen. Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Coppola had the placement of a series of book shelves altered to fit a horizontal poster from \"Apocalypse Now,\" one of his signature films.\n\nThe crew, actors, interns and Coppola himself dined on a spread of shrimp, pasta, pizza, sausage, steak, sandwiches, and whatever else was left in the refrigerator, Holifield said.\n\nNow, when production companies haven't rented out the entire space, tourists can venture to suburban Atlanta and cook from Coppola's own stove.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

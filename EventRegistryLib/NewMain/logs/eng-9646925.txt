Cryer understood: \"We all want to be [treated] as actors,\" he says.

The film shows an old interview where he's asked if he was part of it, and he replies, \"I hope not.\" Still, he was cool enough to go out with Moore: \"We dated for a short time while we were working on No Small Affair, but I guess our particular affair was, in fact, pretty small,\" he told PEOPLE.\n\nWhen McCarthy meets up with Estevez at his home, it was the first time they'd hung out in over 35 years -- however, around the height of their stardom, they were supposed to do another movie together but Estevez explained he didn't want to work with McCarthy after the \"Brat Pack\" article came out. \"We were kryptonite to each other,\" Estevez says. \"We all scattered for the hills.\" The two talk about the ramifications that the nickname the \"Brat Pack\" had on their careers, noting that it stigmatized them, but they've since let it go.

But it's been a journey.\n\nFor years, the \"Pretty In Pink\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire\" actor bristled at the mention of the unshakable description thrust upon a generation of young rising stars in the 1980s. Yet in his new Hulu documentary \"Brats\" (streaming Thursday), McCarthy embarks on a journey tracking down other forever-branded members - stars like Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez - to talk Brat Pack.\n\n\"There's only a handful of us that this all happened to, the only ones who know what it felt like. But we never talked about it,\" director McCarthy, 61, tells USA TODAY of his \"Brats\" discussions with co-stars he hadn't spoken with in decades. \"We have something really profound that happened in our lives, and they were willing to talk to me about it on camera.\"\n\nJoin our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\nHow did Andrew McCarthy get the Brat Pack to talk in 'Brats'?\n\n\"Brats\" begins with McCarthy reaching out to the Brat Pack by pulling out old contacts, even wrangling Judd Nelson's phone number from a manager. McCarthy makes the first filmed call to Estevez, who was the subject of a snarky 1985 New York Magazine cover story that coined the instantly permanent term Brat Pack.\n\n\"I felt that I had lost the narrative of my career overnight,\" McCarthy says of the infamous article. The ensemble movie \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (starring Estevez, Moore, Sheedy, Lowe and Nelson), released a few weeks later, became the white-hot center of the Brat Pack sensation.\n\nContrary to the public imagination, the Brat Pack members didn't hang out, especially after the article came out. And they didn't keep in touch. McCarthy's cold calls kicking off \"Brats\" are raw. Many go to voicemail.\n\n\"When I'm calling somebody, it's the first time in more than 30 years. But it's like, 'Let's call Emilio,' \" McCarthy says. \"I wanted the viewers to be on this journey with me. I seem wary and trepidatious at first.\"\n\nWhen McCarthy meets with Estevez, 62, at his Malibu home in \"Brats,\" it's their first face-to-face encounter since the premiere of \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" The conversation hits on Estevez's past telling comment that \"Brat Pack will be on my tombstone\" (he still believes it and accepts it). The \"Young Guns\" actor also reveals that he avoided starring in movies with McCarthy and the others because they were \"kryptonite to each other.\"\n\n\"Emilio was particularly poignant,\" McCarthy says of the discussion before the two hugged it out.\n\nIn successive conversations with Lowe, Sheedy and Moore (whom he calls \"the Obi-Wan Kenobi of my film\"), McCarthy explores the confusing Brat Pack past and the long, often painful road to appreciating their shared history.\n\n\"Everybody started at the same point: Everybody hated it when it happened. And then over time, everyone's evolution toward it has been different,\" McCarthy says. \"But we never talked about it because the minute it happened, those relationships scattered and those ensemble movies stopped. No one wanted to be in a movie together. So the very naming of the Brat Pack ended the Brat Pack, in a certain way.\"\n\nAre Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson in 'Brats'?\n\nJohn Hughes' 1985 film \"The Breakfast Club\" is a cornerstone of the Brat Pack library, with a cast that includes Estevez, Sheedy, Nelson and Molly Ringwald. The latter two stars did not ultimately sit down for \"Brats\" interviews.\n\n\"We asked Judd, we asked Molly,\" McCarthy says. \"It didn't work out.\"\n\nThere's a recurring \"Brats\" theme of McCarthy wrangling Nelson - talking to him on the phone, leaving messages, and traveling to Los Angeles to find that Nelson is out of town.\n\n\"Then eventually, finally, (Nelson) said, 'You know what? I don't feel like doing it.' Which is fine,\" says McCarthy, who points out that Nelson and Ringwald appear in \"Brats\" through \"really insightful\" archival interviews.\n\nThe vintage footage of the actors being probed about the derivative term during interviews are painful to watch.\n\n\"For like the first two months, the Brat Pack is brought up all the time. And we're reacting to it, often twitching and cringing,\" McCarthy says. \"Clearly, everybody's publicist said 'No Brat Pack questions.' So then everybody's asking about it without using the two words. Which is really awkward because, clearly, that was forbidden. But that didn't work either.\"\n\nThrough the \"Brats\" interviews, which include pop-culture social scientist Malcolm Gladwell, McCarthy furthers his appreciation of why fans looked to these stars during the youth-movie explosion the Brat Pack ignited.\n\n\"The public realized very quickly, 'This is awesome. These guys represent us,' \" McCarthy says. \"So they understood something we didn't at the beginning.\"\n\nPeople are still talking about the Brat Pack 39 years after the article, sharing memories with McCarthy on the streets of New York City, where he resides. He accepts these talks with a grateful state of mind.\n\n\"This film is all of us being like, 'What the heck was all that?' to 'Wow, that was a beautiful thing.' We are the avatars of a generation's youth. I wouldn't trade this for the world. But if you told me that 30 years ago, I would have said that you were crazy.\"\n\nLike Estevez, McCarthy is sure the Brat Pack will follow him beyond this life.\n\n\"If there is an obituary, that will be in the first sentence. Fair play. The beauty of it is that now I'm cool with that.

But the subjects of the article who were tarred with the Brat Pack moniker were less than enthusiastic.\n\n\"I think that's what some of us resented so much at the beginning, is that this isn't the right perception of who we are,\" McCarthy said. \"This isn't the reality of our experience.\"\n\nAs it happens, none of the Brat Pack had ever really talked with one another about that experience. That changes with \"BRATS,\" a new documentary directed by McCarthy in which he and his fellow Brat Pack friends finally share their feelings about that time.\n\nThe 1980s marked a significant shift in Hollywood, with a new wave of young actors emerging as the face of a generation. The 'Brat Pack' was at the forefront of this cultural shift, with their influence shaping popular films of the time, arguably starting with the 1983 drama \"The Outsiders,\" the cast of which included Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, C. Thomas Howell, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon and others.\n\nPerhaps the zenith of Brat Pack cinema, however, arrived in 1985 - the same year the New York magazine feature was published - with the release of the coming-of-age dramas \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" which together variously starred what came to be considered the Brat Pack core of Estevez, Lowe, McCarthy, Moore, and Nelson, with Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, and Anthony Michael Hall also in the mix.\n\n\"I just remember seeing that cover and thinking, 'Oh, f---.' I just thought that was terrible,\" McCarthy said. \"And it turns out, I was right. It was. The article was scathing, about all these young actors. And the phrase being such a clever, witty phrase, it caught the zeitgeist instantly and burned deep and that was it.\"\n\n\"The Brat Pack is an image that somebody thought up who doesn't know anything about us,\" Sheedy said.\n\n\"From then on, my career and the career of several other people was branded -- without any wiggle room -- as the Brat Pack,\" McCarthy said.\n\nYet only a few years after the Brat Pack phenomenon peaked, its members moved on to other projects and the next generation of young film stars grabbed the headlines. Nearly 40 years later, McCarthy thought it would be interesting to reach out to his former fellow Brat Pack members to talk about their experiences at that time and what it means to them now, decades later.\n\n\"When it first happened to us, we all hated it,\" McCarthy told \"Good Morning America\" while promoting \"BRATS.\" \"And over time, it's become the wonderfully iconic, affectionate term.\"\n\nThough some former Brat Pack members declined to participate, including Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson, many others were willing. McCarthy said seeing his old friends, many for the first time in more than 30 years, renewed their friendships as they discussed the past.\n\nThat included Emilio Estevez, whom the article dubbed the unofficial president of the Brat Pack and who McCarthy said he hadn't seen since the premiere night of \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" Estevez not only shared that he felt his career path was \"derailed\" by the feature, but also that he took steps to dissociate himself from his fellow Brat Pack members - including passing on a subsequent script that would have reunited him on-screen with McCarthy.\n\n\"Working together, it just almost felt like we were kryptonite to each other,\" Estevez told McCarthy, adding that he generally had no interest in revisiting that time: \"I think if you're too busy looking in your rear-view mirror and looking at what's behind you, you're gonna stumble trying to move forward.\"\n\nAfter visiting Estevez, McCarthy went to speak with Sheedy, revealing to her for the first time that he had a crush on her back in the day. While she said she has fond memories of her Brat Pack co-stars, like McCarthy, and the films in which she appeared, particularly \"The Breakfast Club,\" she said she felt \"shell-shocked\" after the New York magazine article was published.\n\n\"It felt like it just, like, 'Let's just write off everybody's lives and their experiences and their work,\" Sheedy said.\n\nMcCarthy's later conversations with Demi Moore, Rob Lowe and Jon Cryer are variations on that theme - how they felt then, versus how they view that time now with the benefit of four decades of hindsight.\n\nMoore, with whom McCarthy co-starred in \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" in particular asks, \"Why did we take offense?\" then later admits being called the Brat Pack felt \"unjust\" to her at the time: \"I just felt like it didn't represent us, and I felt like it was a real limited perspective.\"\n\nLikewise, Rob Lowe called the New York magazine feature a \"mean-spirited attempt ... to minimize all of our talents,\" but also agrees with McCarthy that there's \"nothing but goodwill\" associated with the label now.\n\nThough it had been decades since McCarthy had spoken with his fellow Brat Pack members, the one person with whom none of them had ever spoken was the man who coined the phrase when he wrote the New York magazine feature in 1985: David Blum, who said the \"Brat Pack\" title came to him while he was driving around Los Angeles.\n\n\"I thought, 'Well, this is fun,'\" Blum told McCarthy. \"Honestly, it didn't cross my mind, really, that it was all that big a deal.\"\n\nBlum, who was 29 when he wrote the story, seemed as surprised by how McCarthy and the others reacted to it as McCarthy and his fellow 20-something actors felt when they first read it.\n\n\"You were all adults,\" Blum said, pushing back against McCarthy's assertion that the story wasn't written \"with any affection\" toward him and the others.\n\nBut ultimately, Blum does admit, \"There were a couple of things in the article that were just plain-old not nice, and I'm sure I should've been scolded by somebody. And I was. I was just trying to be funny.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coming of age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Bishop", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sammy Davis Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Lawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dean Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Penn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Penn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Sinatra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New wave music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Thomas_Howell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C.

I think there's a certain core group of seven of us that are undeniably in the Brat Pack: Me, Emilio, Judd, Rob, Demi, Ally, and Molly Ringwald.\"\n\n(For reference, that would be Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, and Ally Sheedy.)\n\nThis is part of what McCarthy explores in the new documentary that follows his personal journey to reconnect with the actors given the distinctive moniker. Together, they discuss the cultural impact their films had on our society, and on the actors' personal and professional lives.\n\n\"The Brat Pack has cast a long shadow over my life and career,\" says McCarthy, speaking with television critics at a press event for the film. \"After all these years, I was curious to see how it had affected my fellow members. What I found was surprising -- and liberating.\"\n\nThen he adds to this thought, saying, \"And it seems so silly. It's some silly little term, \"The Brat Pack,\" and yet, [there] was before that article came out, and there was after.\n\nHe's referring to the original 1985 New York Magazine article that coined the term, saying that it was supposed to be a brief little profile on Emilio [Estevez.] And it was right when the movie St. Elmo's Fire came out, and then it evolved the article that it became.\"\n\nMcCarthy says that, \"That was a regional magazine that came out on a Tuesday, and by Friday, the nation was using the term \"Brat Pack,\" and our lives were different.\"\n\nBut once the movie came out, and The Brat Pack term came into existence, McCarthy says that the group scattered, \"No one would be seen in a movie again together. So, I hadn't seen Rob in 30 years. I hadn't seen Emilio since the premiere of St. Elmo's Fire. I hadn't seen Demi in a couple decades.\"\n\nSince his days appearing in those '80s films, McCarthy has also starred in various drama series, including The Resident and Good Girls, and has directed television as well, including several episodes of Orange is the New Black.\n\nHe says that when he began reaching to his former co-stars, they would ask, 'Have you talked to so-and-so? Oh, how are they doin'?'\"\n\n\"So nobody, as far as I could tell, has really been in touch with each other. I mean, there are people that do, but as a group and as a core, I don't think that exists,\" he remarks.\n\nOnce he got a few of his fellow Brat Packers onboard, McCarthy admits that he did no prep work before chatting with them.\n\n\"I just wanted to go talk to people. I didn't have any list of questions. It was all just kitchen table chat. I didn't have any agenda particularly, I was just like, 'this was my experience, what was yours?' I wasn't interested in interviewing people and getting their responses. I was interested in having a conversation with people.\"\n\nIn doing it this way, McCarthy feels that, \"Consequently, I was revealing myself.\"\n\nOne aspect of making the documentary that surprised McCarthy was, \"How much affection we all had for each other. Rob and I weren't particularly close when we were young. He was this Hollywood young movie star dude, and I was trying to be this New York serious actor. And we were kind of competitive, I guess. To see him again after all that time, we hugged. And then we just stepped back and looked at each other, and we just hugged again. I was just shocked by that.\"\n\nBut, not everyone was up for revisiting the past as McCarthy says, \"I asked Molly if she wanted to talk in the film, of course, and she said she'd think about, but that she would probably just like to keep looking forward.\"\n\nHe got some insight about this from Jon Cryer, who co-starred with McCarthy and Ringwald in Pretty in Pink.\n\n\"When I was talking to Jon, he said, 'You know, a lot of time as actors, we want to be free of the baggage of our pop cultural associations and we just want to act.'\"\n\nAlso missing from the documentary is Nelson.\n\n\"Yeah. Judd didn't want to talk. Judd said, \"The Brat Pack didn't exist, so I'm not talking about it,\" McCarthy said with a smile, adding, \"Whereas initially, he said he'd love to, and then he kind of said, 'I don't want to talk about it,' so I was like, Okay.'\"\n\nOverall, McCarthy feels that with those he did speak to, \"It was just nice to be back in touch with these people that I hadn't seen in so long and to sort of bring my past up into my present.\"\n\nSurprisingly, he also spoke with David Blum, the man who wrote the original 'Brat Park' article.\n\nReflecting on the experience, McCarthy says, \"I had never met him before, and he'd never met any of the Brat Pack before. He'd altered our lives and he had never met any of us. I was surprised at my response to that conversation, which I ended up going, 'you know what? I have a great deal of affection for you sitting across from me right now.' I had a warmth for him that I did not anticipate.\"\n\nPondering a bit more on this moment, McCarthy reveals, \"Had the Brat Pack term not existed, I'd be some guy who made some '80s films that at the time really captured something, and some have endured because they have an emotional truth that resonates with people. But, because I'm a member of the Brat Pack, that, to a certain generation, has this currency and value. And l think I've come to feel like that's a beautiful thing, but that was certainly not my response in June of 1985 when, [I was like], 'Who is this monster who just wrote this nasty thing about me?.\"\n\nMcCarthy says that this thought represents one of the major themes of the movie explaining, \"We can all look back on moments in our life and go, 'God, remember when that happened?

Who you wanted to party with.\"\n\nHowever, for the actors under the Brat Pack umbrella, things were \"very different,\" he added. \"We were a group of young actors trying to have careers and we were suddenly bonded together, undoubtedly, forever as this unit.\"\n\nThe Brat Pack moniker stemmed from a 1985 New York magazine article written by David Blum. Initially, the piece was supposed to be a profile about Emilio Estevez, but it became something else after the actor gave Blum unfettered access to his life.\n\nThe Brat Pack: A Complete Guide to the Actors That Ruled the '80s\n\n\"The article was scathing about all these young actors, and the phrase - being such a clever, witty phrase - it caught the zeitgeist instantly and burned deep in,\" McCarthy explained, noting that some of the young stars \"resented\" the title so much that they cut ties with the other members of this \"group.\"\n\nEstevez, for one, \"hasn't talked much\" about the Brat Pack over the last three decades. In fact, Estevez admitted that he only agreed to speak with McCarthy to \"clear the air\" on their friendship - or lack thereof.\n\nAs McCarthy drove to Estevez's house in the documentary, it was revealed they hadn't seen each other since the St. Elmo's Fire premiere in 1985.\n\n\"I always felt like he was sort of an insider in some club, and I always felt like the guy on the outside,\" McCarthy said. Once he was face-to-face with Estevez, the two talked about how they \"didn't do a movie\" because of the Brat Pack association.\n\nThe duo was set to star in Young Men With Unlimited Capital, which never got made. McCarthy's understanding was that Estevez didn't want him in the film.\n\n\"It hurt my feelings, but I assumed it was simply the Brat Pack fallout,\" McCarthy said. Estevez responded, \"I didn't want anything to do with any of us.\"\n\nThe only reason Estevez decided to do Brats was because McCarthy called and asked. \"I also thought it was time that we clear the air on a couple of things,\" he added.\n\nDemi Moore Made 'St. Elmo's Fire' Instead of Seeking Treatment\n\nThe actress has been candid about her addiction issues over the years and told McCarthy that making St. Elmo's Firebecame \"more important\" than her life.\n\n\"They paid to have a sober companion with me 24/7 during the whole shooting. They could have easily found someone else,\" Moore told McCarthy in Brats. \"They were like, 'We want you to check in [to treatment].' I'm like, 'No no, I'm starting a movie.' They said, 'Yes, what's more important: the movie or your life?' I said the movie.\"\n\nShe added: \"For me, I didn't have any value for myself. I think I was so fearful of failing. Fearful of losing and desperate to fit in, belong, and my need to please was definitely on high alert.\"\n\n'Pretty in Pink' Originally Had a Different Ending\n\nMcCarthy also sat down with Pretty in Pink director Howard Deutch. (McCarthy starred in the film alongside Molly Ringwald and Jon Cryer.)\n\nAfter the \"test screening was a disaster,\" the movie's entire ending was changed.\n\nThe Brat Pack Photos Through the Years: From the '80s to Now\n\n\"The original ending was, she goes with Jon, you have a date and they walk into the dance circle and they start to dance, it becomes a swirl of pink and it's over,\" Deutch recalled. \"Booing like I've never heard in my life. Screaming, booing, yelling, throwing things.\"\n\nRob Lowe Thinks the Brat Pack Was a Pipeline to Modern TV\n\n\"TV shows like Glee, The CW ... all of these things we now take for granted don't happen without the Brat Pack,\" Lowe told McCarthy in Brats. \"They just don't.\"\n\n\"The Brat Pack met the Rat Pack,\" Lowe recalled. \"When I think of the Brat Pack, I think of nights like that, because that stuff routinely happened, as it does when you're in that moment.\"\n\nDavid Blum Thought the Name Was 'Funny'\n\nNever did the journalist think about how the moniker he invented would impact the stars' lives.\n\n\"In retrospect, yes, [it was scathing]. At the time, no,\" he admitted to McCarthy. \"I was proud of my creation of the phrase. I was 29. I definitely knew it was going to have a reaction.\"\n\nBlum took ownership of some parts of the article being \"plain old not nice,\" but it seemed he had no regrets.\n\n\"I'm sure I should have been scolded by somebody, and I was,\" he added. \"I was just trying to be funny and I actually - I hope I won't sound too arrogant - but I'm thinking that I might have succeeded.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shelby_stivale@miamiherald.com", "name": "Shelby Stivale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brats_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brats (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming of age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zeitgeist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The CW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Deutch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard Deutch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glee (TV series)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/5zytq9/picture289245305/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5bdc4704-087a-49aa-85dc-ae5de9e8ca35", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 416, "textEnd": 423}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

He said, \"She said she'd think about it and that was really the end of it.\" McCarthy said it \"would've been great\" to chat with Ringwald, but she \"has a lot to say already in the movie\" through archival footage.\n\nBrats premieres on Hulu on June 13.

In the documentary, McCarthy actually gets Blum to sit for an interview.\n\nIn a statement, McCarthy said about the documentary, \"The Brat Pack has cast a long shadow over my life and career.

He had a night out in Los Angeles with Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, and Judd Nelson, and decided to coin the now-iconic phrase which was inspired by the \"Rat Pack,\" a group of entertainers (including Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin) from the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nEstevez, Lowe, Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy make up the Brat Pack, as they all appeared in the ensemble of classic '80s films such as \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"Pretty in Pink.\"\n\nAdjacent members include Jon Cryer and Mare Winningham.\n\nWhile Lowe, 60, has been very complimentary about the Brat Pack title, the rest of the group have been critical of the label and how it negatively impacted their careers in the 1980s.\n\nIn the new Hulu documentary \"Brats,\" McCarthy, 61, rounded up the rest of the Brat Pack (sans Ringwald, 56, and Nelson, 64) to talk about how their lives changed when the iconic phrase was created.\n\n\"My career and the career of everyone who was involved was branded to the Brat Pack ...I've never talked to anybody about what that was like,\" McCarthy said in the trailer. \"So, I thought it might be interesting to try and contact everyone who was in the Brat Pack.\"\n\nThe iconic actors do not hold back their opinions on being involved in the Brat Pack in the Hulu doc. And McCarthy even sat down with Blum for the first time about the phrase he coined.\n\n\"If you had told me 10, 20, 30 years ago I'd be walking out to see David Blum's apartment, the writer of the Brat Pack article, I'd say you're f-king crazy,'\" McCarthy began.\n\n\"I didn't dislike any of them -- I thought they were all quite nice,\" Blum replied. \"It's hard to explain, but I didn't think at the time, 'Ugh, these brats.' At all.\"\n\nMcCarthy then asked Blum if he thought the Brat Pack title was \"scathing.\"\n\n\"I guess in retrospect, yes. At the time, no,\" said Blum. \"I was proud of my creation of the phrase. Look, I was 29. I definitely knew it was gonna have a reaction.\"\n\nHere are all the times the Brat Pack members hated on the group nickname that put them in the spotlight.\n\nOf all the Brat Pack members, McCarthy has been the most open about how he's perceived the Hollywood group label.\n\nThe \"Weekend at Bernies\" actor, who wrote, directed and stars in \"Brats,\" told People earlier this month that the Brat Pack label had \"personal ramifications\" for all the members.\n\n\"Were we brats? We were certainly privileged,\" he said. \"But there wasn't anything great about us. We were just in the right place at the right time and represented that seismic change in pop culture. You're easy prey when you're exposed in that way.\"\n\nMcCarthy continued: \"We just felt unseen. It felt like I lost control of the narrative of my career. Who wants to be stigmatized and branded and labeled?\"\n\n\"We all scattered for the hills,\" he added. \"We didn't want to be associated with it. It had a long shadow over everyone's life to a degree.\"\n\nIn an interview with Us Weekly ahead of the doc's release, McCarthy said the Brat Pack members \"felt sort of, in a weird way, very alone\" when they became associated with each other.\n\n\"We interpreted it as one thing and the whole rest of the public interpreted it entirely differently. That's all any of us ever want in life is to be seen, and we suddenly felt unseen in a certain way.\"\n\nAt the \"Brats\" premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival, McCarthy said he considered the Brat Pack label \"horrible\" back in the day. When he appeared on \"The View,\" he said he \"hated\" the Brat Pack title.\n\nMcCarthy similarly aired his grievances with being apart of the Brat Pack in an interview with Yahoo! Entertainment on June 10.\n\n\"It had a long shadow over us. The interesting thing was the disconnect we felt toward it. It took me personally decades to come around to realize the public was right.\"\n\nIn the \"Brats\" doc, McCarthy says he has \"PTSD\" looking back at when the Brat Pack was created.\n\n\"I just thought that was terrible instantly. And it turns out, I was right. The article was scathing about all these young actors. And the phrase being such a clever, witty phrase, it caught the zeitgeist instantly and burned deep and that was it. From then on my career and the career of everyone involved was branded to the 'Brat Pack.' \"\n\nMoore, 61, explained that she wasn't fond of the \"Brat Pack moniker\" when she appeared on Good Morning America in January.\n\n\"It's really interesting cause you know, the Brat Pack moniker that came about really didn't have anything to do with us as people, as professionals,\" she said. \"It was just a clever headline.\"\n\n\"For me, I didn't love it, being thought of as a brat because I thought it kind of diminished us as professionals, but I didn't carry it,\" Moore added.\n\nEstevez, 62, had a big sisue with Blum naming him in the Brat Pack.\n\n\"I thought that it was wildly unsophisticated,\" he told Yahoo in 2023. \"To come up with that and sort of label us the way he did.\"\n\nIn 2020, Estevez told The Guardian that the Brat Pack term \"will be on my tombstone.\"\n\n\"It's annoying because Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon have worked together more than any of us have. We just made two movies and somehow it morphed into something else,\" the \"Mighty Ducks\" star added.\n\nFurther shading Blum, Estevez said: \"If that's the one thing he has offered the world, that's a shame.\"\n\nNelson has been the harshest critic of the Brat Pack name. In 2015, he said on \"The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast\" that he regrets not punching Blum when they went out together in 1985.\n\n\"I knew there was a problem right away,\" the \"Suddenly Susan\" star recalled. \"When this guy's at dinner, I say to Emilio, 'Who's this guy?' [He said,] 'Well, he's a reporter, he's writing an article on me,' [I said,] 'I don't think he should be here, I don't like him.' He's at the table when I'm saying this.\"\n\n\"This guy, just something about him, he had a stink to him,\" Nelson continued, \"and I think that in retrospect, I would have been better served following my gut feeling and knocking him unconscious. I at least would have felt better about the thing.\"\n\nNelson said that \"a bad thing\" happened to him and the other Brat Pack members after they were grouped together.\n\n\"These were people I worked with, who I really liked as people -- funny, smart, committed to the work. I mean, no one was professionally irresponsible. And after that article, not only are we strongly encouraged not to work with each other again -- and for the most part we haven't -- but it was insinuated we might not want to be hanging out with these people,\" he explained. \"And it was like, I didn't know that good friends are so easy to come by in this world that they should be tossed asunder.\"\n\n\"And to think that we're some kind of gang, or group!\" Nelson added. \"I lived in New York City. I don't go three thousand miles to have a beer. ... But it just seemed like we were like fruit picked too soon, and then blamed for being picked too soon.\"\n\n\"It seems strange to have that subject matter be something for edited entertainment,\" he told Us Weekly in March. \"Also, like, [McCarthy's] a nice guy. but I hadn't seen him in 35 years. And it's like, I'm not going to [be] like, 'Hey!' No, dude.\"\n\nNelson also said: \"I don't even know who's in the Brat Pack. It's like, why kind of rebirth something that wasn't necessarily fun? How can we be experts on something that didn't really exist?\"\n\nHe recalled, \"Whoever was the editor of New York Magazine at the time, it was a set up. 'Let's get all these guys together and get them talking shit.' The truth is in that time frame, I was at the very young end of that group. I was literally still in high school. When we did 'The Breakfast Club,' Emilio and Judd were in their early 20s and they are going out and having beers and I was a teen. So when they did that article I did feel that was a ploy to get all them yapping.\"\n\n\"And I also think audiences want the actors that they watch together in projects to be actually connected in life. They expect that,\" Hall continued. \"People will be like, 'How are Emilio and Judd?' And I'm like, 'I don't know. I haven't seen them in 14 years.' \"\n\nRingwald, who also declined to be in the documentary, opened up about the Brat Pack in a Facebook video in 2022.\n\n\"I really didn't like it,\" she said. \"It was basically the invention of a New York Magazine writer who went out on the town with three actors I had done movies with. Actually, one that I hadn't. Rob Lowe, Emilio, and Judd. And then this term was born.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a very negative term,\" the \"Riverdale\" star shared. \"We were all young actors who were doing well and doing good work and it kind of seemed like a way to bring us down by calling us brats. It felt sort of negative and stuck in a really unpleasant way. Suddenly people were seeing us as brats. All we were were actors who were young and doing movies together. I wasn't hanging out in nightclubs.\n\n\"To have that term attached to me at that age, I found it a little bit unfair.\"\n\nSheedy, 61, told The Independent in 2020 that Blum's Brat Pack article was extremely far-fetched.\n\n\"The ladies weren't there! I think he got one particular angle when the truth is that the guys would hang out a bit, but we weren't hanging out as one big group,\" she said at the time. \"We weren't young actors running around town spending all our time together. I thought it was a little gossipy and undermining, and I didn't know that it was going to stick the way that it did. It was uncomfortable for quite a long time.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nelson and Ringwald were two of a handful of actors in \"The Brat Pack.\"\n\n\"I mean, they both are in the film in a sense that there's a lot of clips and interviews and things,\" the Pretty in Pink star said. Ringwald and Nelson both appear in the film via archival footage and clips from the height of their fame in the '80s. Nelson also makes a brief appearance through a phone call at the end of the movie.\n\nMcCarthy continued, \"The Brat Pack is an ongoing relationship, you know what I mean? And some people are at different places in their lives to want to or not want to talk about it. I think that just informs it even more. I mean, that's my takeaway from it.\"\n\nThe St. Elmo's Fire star, who has picked up more jobs behind the camera in recent years on shows like Orange Is the New Black and The Sinner as well as the feature-film documentary he is currently promoting, joked with ET that while he was excited to begin the filmmaking process on Brats, he feared being spurned by all those he reached out to.\n\n\"I was surprised as many people would want to speak to me [that] did, you know, because I thought the biggest challenge would be to get people to participate,\" he quipped. \"I knew it was still so sort of dodgy in some people's lives.\"\n\nWhile Nelson and Ringwald opted out, McCarthy was able to get Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy and Rob Lowe to appear. He also brought in \"Brat Pack\" adjacent stars like his Pretty In Pink co-star, Jon Cryer, and Back to the Future actress Lea Thompson. The term applies to the teen actors from the '80s who seemingly ran Hollywood thanks to their slate of massive films like The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, Pretty in Pink and more.\n\nMcCarthy said that while some who tune in for the documentary may see the final scene as a tease for a potential sequel, he is pretty confident one Brats film is enough for the group of actors who spent the majority of their foundational years in the spotlight.\n\n\"We're getting ready for part two,\" he joked, adding that for the gang who came together to unpack their trauma, \"I think once was enough.\"\n\nBack in May 2023, McCarthy spoke with ET and revealed that he reunited with his Brat Pack pals, Lowe and Estevez, for the documentary on the '80s crew. He kept details up his sleeve at the time but shared that he was excited for the world to see the project.\n\n\"It seems crazy,\" McCarthy said when asked about their reunion. \"I went back and started hunting everybody down again and we just hadn't seen each other in all these [decades]. So it was great to catch up with everybody again.\"\n\nDemi Moore and Rob Lowe Revisit Brat Pack Days in 'BRATS' Trailer\n\n'Brats' Documentary First Look: '80s Stars Reunite to Unpack Brat Pack Era", "source": {"uri": "cbs8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cbs8.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelson (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brats_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brats (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sinner_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sinner (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orange Is the New Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lea_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lea Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Back to the Future"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.tegna-media_750x422.com", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Who you wanted to party with.\"\n\nHowever, for the actors under the Brat Pack umbrella, things were \"very different,\" he added. \"We were a group of young actors trying to have careers and we were suddenly bonded together, undoubtedly, forever as this unit.\"\n\nThe Brat Pack moniker stemmed from a 1985 New York magazine article written by David Blum. Initially, the piece was supposed to be a profile about Emilio Estevez, but it became something else after the actor gave Blum unfettered access to his life.\n\n\"The article was scathing about all these young actors, and the phrase -- being such a clever, witty phrase -- it caught the zeitgeist instantly and burned deep in,\" McCarthy explained, noting that some of the young stars \"resented\" the title so much that they cut ties with the other members of this \"group.\"\n\nEstevez, for one, \"hasn't talked much\" about the Brat Pack over the last three decades. In fact, Estevez admitted that he only agreed to speak with McCarthy to \"clear the air\" on their friendship -- or lack thereof.\n\nKeep scrolling for the biggest revelations from Brats:\n\nAs McCarthy drove to Estevez's house in the documentary, it was revealed they hadn't seen each other since the St. Elmo's Fire premiere in 1985.\n\n\"I always felt like he was sort of an insider in some club, and I always felt like the guy on the outside,\" McCarthy said. Once he was face-to-face with Estevez, the two talked about how they \"didn't do a movie\" because of the Brat Pack association.\n\nThe duo was set to star in Young Men With Unlimited Capital, which never got made. McCarthy's understanding was that Estevez didn't want him in the film.\n\n\"It hurt my feelings, but I assumed it was simply the Brat Pack fallout,\" McCarthy said. Estevez responded, \"I didn't want anything to do with any of us.\"\n\n\"They paid to have a sober companion with me 24/7 during the whole shooting. They could have easily found someone else,\" Moore told McCarthy in Brats. \"They were like, 'We want you to check in [to treatment].' I'm like, 'No no, I'm starting a movie.' They said, 'Yes, what's more important: the movie or your life?' I said the movie.\"\n\nShe added: \"For me, I didn't have any value for myself. I think I was so fearful of failing. Fearful of losing and desperate to fit in, belong, and my need to please was definitely on high alert.\"\n\nMcCarthy also sat down with Pretty in Pink director Howard Deutch. (McCarthy starred in the film alongside Molly Ringwald and Jon Cryer.)\n\nAfter the \"test screening was a disaster,\" the movie's entire ending was changed.\n\n\"The original ending was, she goes with Jon, you have a date and they walk into the dance circle and they start to dance, it becomes a swirl of pink and it's over,\" Deutch recalled. \"Booing like I've never heard in my life. Screaming, booing, yelling, throwing things.\"\n\n\"TV shows like Glee, The CW ... all of these things we now take for granted don't happen without the Brat Pack,\" Lowe told McCarthy in Brats. \"They just don't.\"\n\nObviously, the Brat Pack was a play on Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack. Lowe and McCarthy had a night out with Liza Minnelli in the 1980s that led to a chance meeting with Sammy Davis Jr.\n\n\"The Brat Pack met the Rat Pack,\" Lowe recalled. \"When I think of the Brat Pack, I think of nights like that, because that stuff routinely happened, as it does when you're in that moment.\"\n\nNever did the journalist think about how the moniker he invented would impact the stars' lives.\n\n\"In retrospect, yes, [it was scathing]. At the time, no,\" he admitted to McCarthy. \"I was proud of my creation of the phrase. I was 29. I definitely knew it was going to have a reaction.\"\n\nBlum took ownership of some parts of the article being \"plain old not nice,\" but it seemed he had no regrets.\n\n\"I'm sure I should have been scolded by somebody, and I was,\" he added. \"I was just trying to be funny and I actually -- I hope I won't sound too arrogant -- but I'm thinking that I might have succeeded.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shelby_stivale@usmagazine.com", "name": "Shelby Stivale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brats_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brats (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming of age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Deutch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Howard Deutch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The CW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sammy Davis Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liza_Minnelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liza Minnelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glee (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Sinatra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brats-Documentary-Revelations-Andrew-McCarthy-and-Emilio-Estevez-30-Year-Rift.jpg?crop=0px%2C277px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 314, "textEnd": 321}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

It notes that the success of teen-focused films in the 1980s -- specifically John Hughes films like The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink, along with Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire - represented a turning point where the film industry began to feature coming-of-age movies, often with the same group of young actors.\n\nMcCarthy, who was in both Pretty in Pink and St. Elmo's Fire, joined a group of burgeoning talents who would become major stars, including Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Rob Lowe. The films they starred in -- often featuring high school-age kids in various circumstances struggling to find love or acceptance -- channeled the struggles of youth across the globe, turning them into Beatles-level stars in the process.\n\n\"Hollywood discovered the box office potential of a young audience,\" McCarthy says in somber narration over clips from films as disparate as Risky Business, Dirty Dancing, Back to the Future, Footloose and Weird Science. \"It seemed that every weekend, there was another movie and another movie and another movie about and starring young people. In the history of Hollywood, it had never been like this.\"\n\nBut then journalist David Blum wrote a story in 1985 for New York magazine titled \"Hollywood's Brat Pack,\" centered on time spent partying with Estevez, Lowe and Nelson, that cast shade on the group -- lumping them together as unprofessional and over-privileged, while sticking them with a moniker which would follow them all around for decades. (One line described them as \"a roving band of famous young stars on the prowl for parties, women, and a good time,\" shortly before noting none of them had graduated from college.)\n\nMcCarthy, who admits he aspired to be a particularly serious actor back then, really bristled at the term, refusing to talk about it publicly very much. In another delicious irony the film fails to explore, Blum's original article refers to McCarthy in a way that implies the author may not have even seen him as a bona fide member of the Brat Pack back then -- despite the actor's insistence that the term affected how he was perceived in Hollywood.\n\nWhich why it is surprising to see footage of him at the start of Brats, calling up actors he was never very close to but has been professionally linked with for nearly 40 years -- suggesting they get together in front of cameras for a documentary he is directing and will star in -- to actually talk about this Brat Pack thing.\n\nEstevez, who the article called \"the unofficial president of the Brat Pack,\" seems wary even in talking for the documentary, while eager to get some things off his chest. Relatively quickly, he apologizes for refusing to star in a movie with McCarthy shortly after the article was published, for fear of feeding the narrative.\n\n\"It was na\u00efve of me to think this journalist would be my friend,\" Estevez admits, while noting he had never participated in a major magazine profile before Blum's story. \"I had already seen a different path for myself. And I felt derailed.\"\n\nScenes like this allow Brats to work on a few different levels at once. Through McCarthy's own words and his catch ups with other Brat Packers like Estevez, Sheedy, Moore and Lowe, we get a sense of the people at the heart of a massive pop culture phenomenon.\n\nThis is a burgeoning genre in the documentary world: films and docuseries looking back at gigantic pop culture moments from decades ago, to reveal the unexplored cost for those at the center of things (think recent documentaries on Britney Spears and child stars on Nickelodeon). And there is value in hearing these performers, held up as legends for so long, grappling with the very understandable feeling they were stereotyped just as their careers were taking off.\n\n\"Why did we take [the term Brat Pack] as an offense?\" Moore tells McCarthy earnestly in one moment. \"I felt a sense of it being unjust. I just felt like it didn't represent us...But I don't know if I took it as personal over time as you did.\"\n\nSheedy, Pretty in Pink co-star Jon Cryer and others talk about seeing the enthusiasm around these emerging stars suddenly curdle into insulting assumptions that dismissed their talents. And one of the elements which fueled their success -- appearing together as a pack of friends in films -- suddenly disappeared, as they all fled the stigma of the term.\n\nBut the other, perhaps unintentional effect of watching Brats, is revelation of how the sometimes clueless privilege these so-called Brat Packers enjoyed back then has stuck around, barely examined, decades later.\n\nMaking an impact in Hollywood is difficult. Starring in big movies, even more so. But starring in massive movies that are considered the voice of a generation? That is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nBut, instead of feeling gratitude for landing in the right place at the absolutely best time to land parts in films like Class, Less Than Zero, Weekend at Bernie's and other hits, McCarthy seems to have spent way too much time fretting over whether the Brat Pack label kept him from larger stardom or more serious work. And it doesn't seem a coincidence that the most successful Brat Packers McCarthy could get on camera -- Moore and Lowe -- long ago made their peace with a term that has evolved into a more endearing label, softened by nostalgia and filled with respect.\n\nMcCarthy asks a lot of good questions, including one that should be simple but really isn't: Who is in the Brat Pack? Is it just the people Blum cites in his story -- including Tom Cruise and Matt Dillon -- or should it also include performers who worked with them around the same time, like Jon Cryer? (In Brats, Cryer tells the camera emphatically, \"I am not in the Brat Pack.\" It's tough to tell if he's joking.)\n\nThis film also breezes past something that was always a big sticking point for me when it came to Brat Pack movies -- the decided lack of racial and ethnic diversity.\n\nMcCarthy talks to several fans, critics and experts about the Brat Pack phenomenon. But there is just one Black person who speaks briefly and very soothingly about these films' lack of diversity, before author Malcolm Gladwell -- who is biracial -- pops up to assure the director that it made perfect sense for Hughes to center so many of his hit movies on angsty white kids in suburban Chicago.\n\nFor fans of color like me, there was always a double edge to the success of Brat Pack-style films. Many themes were universal, but there was a nose-pressed-to-glass element of watching celebrated characters in an environment light years removed from my own experience.\n\nCharacters of color, when they did surface, could be the butt of jokes. It would take the rise of Black directors like Spike Lee, Matty Rich and John Singleton to bring the Brat Pack's youth revolution to Black-centered stories in much smaller films.\n\nBottom line: actors considered part of the Brat Park were packaged together in big budget films by producers and directors looking to tell certain stories and reach certain audiences. As several people tell McCarthy in the film, even after the article was published, lots of people thought the Brat Pack were still the cool kids in Hollywood - and wanted to be part of that club.\n\nMany other talented performers got left out of that process. And complaining about what you didn't get -- when you did receive massive fame, wealth and career opportunities at an early age -- feels a little uncharitable, especially so many years later.\n\nBut then McCarthy actually sits down with the author of the New York piece, David Blum. And your sympathy for the actor and all the other Brat Packers rises again.\n\nThat's because Blum mostly refuses to admit that his article was intentionally negative or sought to take down stars like Estevez and Lowe. He takes pride in creating the phrase, noting that he perhaps should have gotten credit for building the wave of publicity which helped make movies like St. Elmo's Fire a hit.\n\nBut Blum takes little responsibility for how the piece's negative tone might have impacted his sources -- or the implications of writing, without any real warning, a story that seemed quite different from the original feature he had told Estevez he was assembling.\n\nIt's obvious that the actors featured in Blum's original piece have mostly done well for themselves, crafting careers that outpaced the label he gave them. But even as he's ending the interview, McCarthy can't help pushing for an apology -- asking the writer, almost plaintively, \"Do you think you could have been nicer?\"\n\nNearly 40 years later, it still seems tough for McCarthy to admit that accepting the label and living well -- both because of and in spite of it -- is likely the best possible response. (He seems to handle it all much better in a recent guest essay for The New York Times.)\n\nIt's also obvious that watching him inexorably led to that conclusion while making this film -- a journey brimming with nostalgia, pop culture potency and a bittersweet look back at youthful times -- makes for one seriously compelling documentary.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news",

This group was later dubbed the \"Brat Pack\" by journalist David Blum, whose article painted them as frivolous party-goers, altering their careers.\n\nMcCarthy, who also starred in \"Less Than Zero,\" initially resented Blum's article and distanced himself from the Brat Pack association. \"I hated it when it first happened. I felt like it was stigmatizing and limiting,\" he noted. Over the years, his perspective changed, leading to his 2021 memoir and now the documentary \"Brats.\"\n\nIn \"Brats,\" McCarthy reflects on how his relationship with the Brat Pack label evolved. \"How we relate to the experiences of our lives changes drastically over time,\" he told IndieWire.\n\nThe documentary captures the cultural shift of the 1980s when Hollywood realized the commercial potential of youth-oriented films. McCarthy explained, \"Hollywood discovered that kids go to the movies half a dozen times, grown-ups go once. Fuck the grown-ups, let's make movies for kids.\"\n\n\"Brats\" also explores how Blum's article impacted the Brat Pack actors, causing them to avoid projects that would reunite them. Despite the initial resentment, McCarthy has grown to see the positive aspects of the Brat Pack legacy. \"I and other members of the Brat Pack are the avatars of youth for a generation. They look at us with such affection because they see their own youths and project their coming of age and what a wondrous time it is on to us,\" McCarthy said.\n\nThe film includes interviews with Brat Pack members and David Blum, providing a comprehensive view of the group's impact.

Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images hide caption\n\nHow you feel about Andrew McCarthy's searching, earnest, frequently self-important and occasionally clueless documentary about Hollywood's so-called \"brat pack\" of actors -- titled, somewhat self-consciously, Brats - may depend on what you think about the whole phenomenon in the first place.\n\nBrats does a great job reminding us why we should care about the subject at all. It notes that the success of teen-focused films in the 1980s -- specifically John Hughes films like The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink, along with Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire - represented a turning point where the film industry began to feature coming-of-age movies, often with the same group of young actors.\n\nMcCarthy, who was in both Pretty in Pink and St. Elmo's Fire, joined a group of burgeoning talents who would become major stars, including Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Rob Lowe. The films they starred in -- often featuring high school-age kids in various circumstances struggling to find love or acceptance -- channeled the struggles of youth across the globe, turning them into Beatles-level stars in the process.\n\n\"Hollywood discovered the box office potential of a young audience,\" McCarthy says in somber narration over clips from films as disparate as Risky Business, Dirty Dancing, Back to the Future, Footloose and Weird Science. \"It seemed that every weekend, there was another movie and another movie and another movie about and starring young people. In the history of Hollywood, it had never been like this.\"\n\nBut then journalist David Blum wrote a story in 1985 for New York magazine titled \"Hollywood's Brat Pack,\" centered on time spent partying with Estevez, Lowe and Nelson, that cast shade on the group -- lumping them together as unprofessional and over-privileged, while sticking them with a moniker which would follow them all around for decades. (One line described them as \"a roving band of famous young stars on the prowl for parties, women, and a good time,\" shortly before noting none of them had graduated from college.)\n\nMcCarthy, who admits he aspired to be a particularly serious actor back then, really bristled at the term, refusing to talk about it publicly very much. In another delicious irony the film fails to explore, Blum's original article refers to McCarthy in a way that implies the author may not have even seen him as a bona fide member of the Brat Pack back then -- despite the actor's insistence that the term affected how he was perceived in Hollywood.\n\nWhich why it is surprising to see footage of him at the start of Brats, calling up actors he was never very close to but has been professionally linked with for nearly 40 years -- suggesting they get together in front of cameras for a documentary he is directing and will star in -- to actually talk about this Brat Pack thing.\n\nEstevez, who the article called \"the unofficial president of the Brat Pack,\" seems wary even in talking for the documentary, while eager to get some things off his chest. Relatively quickly, he apologizes for refusing to star in a movie with McCarthy shortly after the article was published, for fear of feeding the narrative.\n\n\"It was na\u00efve of me to think this journalist would be my friend,\" Estevez admits, while noting he had never participated in a major magazine profile before Blum's story. \"I had already seen a different path for myself. And I felt derailed.\"\n\nScenes like this allow Brats to work on a few different levels at once. Through McCarthy's own words and his catch ups with other Brat Packers like Estevez, Sheedy, Moore and Lowe, we get a sense of the people at the heart of a massive pop culture phenomenon.\n\nThis is a burgeoning genre in the documentary world: films and docuseries looking back at gigantic pop culture moments from decades ago, to reveal the unexplored cost for those at the center of things (think recent documentaries on Britney Spears and child stars on Nickelodeon). And there is value in hearing these performers, held up as legends for so long, grappling with the very understandable feeling they were stereotyped just as their careers were taking off.\n\n\"Why did we take [the term Brat Pack] as an offense?\" Moore tells McCarthy earnestly in one moment. \"I felt a sense of it being unjust. I just felt like it didn't represent us...But I don't know if I took it as personal over time as you did.\"\n\nSheedy, Pretty in Pink co-star Jon Cryer and others talk about seeing the enthusiasm around these emerging stars suddenly curdle into insulting assumptions that dismissed their talents. And one of the elements which fueled their success -- appearing together as a pack of friends in films -- suddenly disappeared, as they all fled the stigma of the term.\n\nBut the other, perhaps unintentional effect of watching Brats, is revelation of how the sometimes clueless privilege these so-called Brat Packers enjoyed back then has stuck around, barely examined, decades later.\n\nMaking an impact in Hollywood is difficult. Starring in big movies, even more so. But starring in massive movies that are considered the voice of a generation? That is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nBut, instead of feeling gratitude for landing in the right place at the absolutely best time to land parts in films like Class, Less Than Zero, Weekend at Bernie's and other hits, McCarthy seems to have spent way too much time fretting over whether the Brat Pack label kept him from larger stardom or more serious work. And it doesn't seem a coincidence that the most successful Brat Packers McCarthy could get on camera -- Moore and Lowe -- long ago made their peace with a term that has evolved into a more endearing label, softened by nostalgia and filled with respect.\n\nMcCarthy asks a lot of good questions, including one that should be simple but really isn't: Who is in the Brat Pack? Is it just the people Blum cites in his story -- including Tom Cruise and Matt Dillon -- or should it also include performers who worked with them around the same time, like Jon Cryer? (In Brats, Cryer tells the camera emphatically, \"I am not in the Brat Pack.\" It's tough to tell if he's joking.)\n\nThis film also breezes past something that was always a big sticking point for me when it came to Brat Pack movies -- the decided lack of racial and ethnic diversity.\n\nMcCarthy talks to several fans, critics and experts about the Brat Pack phenomenon. But there is just one Black person who speaks briefly and very soothingly about these films' lack of diversity, before author Malcolm Gladwell -- who is biracial -- pops up to assure the director that it made perfect sense for Hughes to center so many of his hit movies on angsty white kids in suburban Chicago.\n\nFor fans of color like me, there was always a double edge to the success of Brat Pack-style films. Many themes were universal, but there was a nose-pressed-to-glass element of watching celebrated characters in an environment light years removed from my own experience.\n\nCharacters of color, when they did surface, could be the butt of jokes. It would take the rise of Black directors like Spike Lee, Matty Rich and John Singleton to bring the Brat Pack's youth revolution to Black-centered stories in much smaller films.\n\nBottom line: actors considered part of the Brat Park were packaged together in big budget films by producers and directors looking to tell certain stories and reach certain audiences. As several people tell McCarthy in the film, even after the article was published, lots of people thought the Brat Pack were still the cool kids in Hollywood - and wanted to be part of that club.\n\nMany other talented performers got left out of that process. And complaining about what you didn't get -- when you did receive massive fame, wealth and career opportunities at an early age -- feels a little uncharitable, especially so many years later.\n\nBut then McCarthy actually sits down with the author of the New York piece, David Blum. And your sympathy for the actor and all the other Brat Packers rises again.\n\nThat's because Blum mostly refuses to admit that his article was intentionally negative or sought to take down stars like Estevez and Lowe. He takes pride in creating the phrase, noting that he perhaps should have gotten credit for building the wave of publicity which helped make movies like St. Elmo's Fire a hit.\n\nBut Blum takes little responsibility for how the piece's negative tone might have impacted his sources -- or the implications of writing, without any real warning, a story that seemed quite different from the original feature he had told Estevez he was assembling.\n\nIt's obvious that the actors featured in Blum's original piece have mostly done well for themselves, crafting careers that outpaced the label he gave them. But even as he's ending the interview, McCarthy can't help pushing for an apology -- asking the writer, almost plaintively, \"Do you think you could have been nicer?\"\n\nNearly 40 years later, it still seems tough for McCarthy to admit that accepting the label and living well -- both because of and in spite of it -- is likely the best possible response. (He seems to handle it all much better in a recent guest essay for The New York Times.)\n\nIt's also obvious that watching him inexorably led to that conclusion while making this film -- a journey brimming with nostalgia, pop culture potency and a bittersweet look back at youthful times -- makes for one seriously compelling documentary.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news",

(The documentary mentions Tom Cruise and Matt Dillon as questionable members, and Jon Cryer, Timothy Hutton, and Robert Downey Jr. are sometimes also cited as members).\n\nThe core Brat Pack movies include \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Pretty In Pink,\" \"Sixteen Candles\" and \"St. Emo's Fire.\"\n\nDirected by and starring McCarthy, 61, the documentary follows McCarthy as he seeks out his former peers - some of whom he hasn't seen in several decades - and has frank conversations with them.\n\nHere are the biggest revelations from the doc.\n\nDemi Moore, 61, was in \"St Elmo's Fire\" at the beginning of her career in 1985. Moore has previously been open about her drug and alcohol addiction struggles, and her time in rehab.\n\nWhen McCarthy visited Moore onscreen, he recalled their first meeting, when the film's director, Joel Schumacher \"presented you like a creature you created.\"\n\nReminiscing about the late Schumacher, who died of cancer at age 80 in 2020, Moore said, \"He really stuck his neck out for me, it's not like I had any box office draw.\"\n\nShe admitted, \"They paid to have a companion, a sober companion with me 24/7 during the whole shooting. They could have easily just found someone else.\"\n\nMoore added that while she was in treatment for addiction, \"They said, 'What's more important to you, the movie or your life?' I said 'the movie!' I didn't have any value for myself...I was desperate to fit in, belong. My need to please was on high alert.\"\n\nWhen McCarthy went to visit Rob Lowe, 60, Lowe said, \"There's always going to be some perception that bumps up against how you see yourself. No one liked [the Brat Pack label]. I don't want to come off seeming like I'm so Pollyanna that I don't realize or didn't know at the time what a f-king disaster and how mean spirited and what an attempt that was to minimize our talents.\"\n\nHowever, he's now at peace with the label.\n\n\"It pains me when I see folks who don't see how much love is infused into the Brat Pack. It's nothing but goodwill,\" he said.\n\nWhen McCarthy asked if the label will follow them \"to the end,\" Lowe replied, \"it will, for sure. It should.\"\n\nLowe continued, \"We were so lucky to be in the right place at the right time as the movie business was beginning the transition to where it landed and still exists -- which is movies made almost exclusively for 18 to 20 year olds, every summer movie that's out is geared towards that audience. It wasn't always like that. We were there at that time that it began.\"\n\nLowe added, \"It changed all of our lives....it changed what entertainment is.\"\n\nWhen McCarthy went to visit Estevez, 62, McCarthy admitted that he hadn't seen him since the premiere of \"St. Elmo's Fire\" in 1985.\n\nAs the two men went down memory lane, Estevez admitted that he was so thrown by the Brat Pack label because, \"It created the perception that we were lightweights, that we didn't take it seriously.\"\n\nAs a result, he said, he turned down a movie with McCarthy that was \"one of the best scripts that I had read in a long time.\"\n\n\"They told me that you didn't want me to do it, it hurt my feelings,\" said McCarthy.\n\nEstevez explained, \"I didn't want anything to do with any of us. If it were Judd [Nelson], I would have said the same thing. To be seen again in another film [with Brat Pack members] would ultimately and potentially have a negative impact...it almost felt like we were kryptonite to each other.\"\n\nWhen McCarthy asked if Estevez would eliminate the Brat Pack label if he could, Estevez said that was a \"difficult question to answer.\"\n\n\"You can only know the known,\" he explained. \"Was it something that we benefited from? Maybe. But in the long run, I think we did not. I think there was more damage done by it than good.\"\n\nOnscreen, Lowe and McCarthy reminisced about a night they had out drinking with Liza Minelli, where they ended up at Sammy Davis Jr.'s house.\n\n\"You were pretty cool and savvy, and even you were like 'holy sh-t,'\" McCarthy said to Lowe. \"[Davis Jr.] was playing bartender. He was like, 'I've got my eye on you cats, I love what you're doing.'\"\n\nLowe said, \"That is when the Brat Pack met the Rat Pack. When I think of the Brat Pack, I think of nights like that, because that stuff routinely happened.\"\n\nSheedy, 61, and McCarthy starred in \"St. Elmo's Fire\" together. \"I had a little crush on you back in the day,\" he told her in the doc.\n\n\"You did not!\" Sheedy replied.\n\n\"I was so scared, I was so busy being aloof,\" he added, to which she agreed, \"Yes you were aloof!\"\n\nWhen McCarthy went to visit \"Pretty In Pink\" director Howard Deutch, Deutch said, \"The test screening was a disaster.\"\n\nHe explained how the original ending of the 1986 teen drama does not have Andie (Ringwald) and Blane (McCarthy) end up together, even though Andie has fallen for him over the course of the film.\n\nDeutch said at the test screening, there was \"Booing like I've never heard in my life.\" Viewers were also \"screaming, booing, throwing things.\" They got one day to re-shoot the movie's real ending, which sees Andie and Blane together.\n\nMcCarthy looked a bit different in the last scene of the iconic film -- and for good reason. The actor wore a wig when Blane and Andie romantically kissed as \"If You Leave\" by Orchestral Maneuvers in the Dark played in the background because of the reshoot.\n\n\"They wanted the fairytale ending,\" McCarthy said, adding with a laugh: \"It wasn't a very good wig.\"\n\nRingwald, 56, is one of the most iconic Brat Pack members, with her signature short red coif and her starring roles in \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Pretty In Pink\" and \"Sixteen Candles.\" Her absence from the documentary is glaring.\n\n\"I asked Molly if she liked to speak,\" McCarthy noted onscreen. \"She said she'd think about it, but she'd like to just keep looking forward.\"\n\nHe also noted how hard it was to track down his former compatriots and get them to talk to him.\n\n\"Judd [Nelson] is at some undisclosed location and not available and Rob is suddenly in Orlando...My wife said making this movie would be 'good for my humility' and now I understand what she was talking about,\" he commented.\n\nNelson, 64, refused to be in the documentary. \"It seems strange to have that subject matter be something for edited entertainment,\" Nelson, 64, told Us Weekly while attending the Children Uniting Nations 24th Annual Academy Awards Celebration & Viewing Dinner on March 10 in Beverly Hills.\n\n\"Also, like, [McCarthy's] a nice guy,\" he continued, \"but I hadn't seen him in 35 years. ... And it's like, I'm not going to [be] like, 'Hey!' No, dude.\"\n\nHowever, he's sort of in it - in a one-sided phone call where the viewer only hears McCarthy. At the very end of the film, McCarthy's phone rings, and he answers it saying, \"Hello. Judd?!\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Schumacher", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Schumacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Downey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Hutton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Hutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Deutch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Howard Deutch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelson (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Davis_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sammy Davis Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

It explores the narrative that took hold of their lives once the phrase was coined.\n\nHowever, one of the era's biggest stars was conspicuously absent from those who appeared in the documentary; Molly Ringwald. She was the star of Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, and The Breakfast Club and an icon for millions of movie fans worldwide.\n\nMcCarthy addressed Ringwald's absence from Brats in an interview for Us Weekly. \"She said she'd think about it, and that was the end of it,\" he explains.\n\nInstead, McCarthy used archival footage to share Ringwald's thoughts about the label. However, he added that it \"would've been great\" to speak with her, as they co-starred together in the iconic John Hughes film Pretty in Pink.\n\n\"She's so articulate and insightful about these things,\" McCarthy continued. \"The Brat Pack's a funny thing. It's like an octopus -- it has these long tentacles you still reach out, and you can either feel them as an embrace or as something [else]. People are at different places in their lives.\"\n\nFor Brats, instead of circumventing the story of The Brat Pack, Andrew McCarthy went right to its source. He reunited with his former co-workers, many of whom he had not seen for over 30 years.\n\nMcCarthy spoke to Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Jon Cryer, Lea Thompson, and Timothy Hutton. Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Dillon are sometimes also mentioned in association with the Brat Pack, but as the movie notes, they've never technically been attached to the label.\n\nMcCarthy's contemporaries from that era admitted that the \"Brat Pack\" name had a stigma. Some actors reportedly wouldn't work together again after being grouped together in that manner.\n\nSurprisingly, actor Judd Nelson was also absent from the documentary. However, he did speak to McCarthy off-camera.\n\n\"Judd [is], I think, in an undisclosed location,\" McCarthy explained of the actor, whose portrayal of John Bender in The Breakfast Club endeared him to movie fans. \"But we did speak.\"\n\n\"The Brat Pack\" title was not a moniker Andrew McCarthy and his contemporaries sought out. It came from New York Magazine writer David Blum, who coined the phrase in a story about the 1980s actors as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the 1950s Rat Pack.\n\nHe wrote, \"This is the Hollywood 'Brat Pack.' It is to the 1980s what the Rat Pack was to the 1960s -- a roving band of famous young stars on the prowl for parties, women, and a good time. And just like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis Jr., these guys work together, too -- they've carried their friendships over from life into the movies.\"\n\nIt continued, \"They make major movies with big directors and get fat contracts and limousines. They have top agents and protective P.R. people. They have legions of fans who write them letters, buy them drinks, follow them home. And, most important, they sell movie tickets.\"\n\nFor Brats, McCarthy sat down with Blum and asked about the article that changed the trajectory of his and his fellow actors lives.

It's like an octopus -- it has these long tentacles you still reach out and you can either feel them as an embrace or as something [else]. People are at different places in their lives.\"\n\nMcCarthy said that he \"wanted to talk to 50 more people\" about their experiences in the Brat Pack but \"time\" and \"money\" held him back.\n\nOn-screen, he noted how hard it was to track down his former compatriots and get them to talk to him.\n\n\"Judd is at some undisclosed location and not available and Rob is suddenly in Orlando ... My wife said making this movie would be 'good for my humility' and now I understand what she was talking about,\" he said.\n\nIn the film, he also explains onscreen, \"I asked Molly if she liked to speak. She said she'd think about it but she'd like to just keep looking forward.\"\n\nIn April, Ringwald told Variety she felt limited by the Brat Pack label at the time.\n\n\"Not everyone was able to write for teenagers as successfully as [John Hughes] did,\" she said of the famed director. \"And even though I wanted to take on adult material, I was limited because I was still a teenager.\"\n\nShe added that the label \"was kind of a way to dismiss\" the actors when they tried to land future roles.\n\nNevertheless, Ringwald went on to have a steady career with work in \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager,\" the Netflix \"Kissing Booth\" franchise, \"Riverdale\" and recent roles in Ryan Murphy's \"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" and \"Feud: Capote vs. the Swans.\"\n\nAs for what projects she refuses to do now?\n\nShe joked: \"I've definitely had enough of anything having to do with teenagers.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

His new documentary, Brats, took him on a journey that changed that.\n\n\"The Brat Pack didn't exist in a brick and mortar way, but it totally did exist because here we are over 35 years later, and we're still talking about it,\" he said. \"It certainly continues to exist as an entity, culturally. I found the experience of making the film quite liberating in a certain way.\"\n\nThe journey the filmmaker never previously wanted or planned to take started when he wrote his best-selling memoir, Brat: An 80s Story, which had him reflecting on his career. It came out in 2021.\n\n\"I finished that and thought, 'Well, what the hell did everyone else experience?' I knew the other people in this group had the same starting point, and we all didn't like it when it happened. I just thought it would be interesting to turn the gaze and see them, talk and see what their experience was,\" McCarthy mused. \"People ended up being game to talk about that to a large degree. I was most interested in how my experience as part of the Brat Pack has changed 180 degrees from when it first happened. I hated it initially, but now I've realized it's one of the largest blessings of my professional life.\"\n\n\"Our perception of things can shift over time. The Brat Pack was the skeleton I hung this on because that's hopefully an interesting thing for people to see a movie about. To me, a trip down memory lane wasn't that interesting. However, reconciling and asking myself, 'How do I deal with my past and how does that change over time?' was very interesting to me.\"\n\nClass star McCarthy and his fellow members, including Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy, loathed the label bestowed on them by a cover story written by journalist David Blum and published in New York Magazine in 1985.\n\nBrats premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. Where can you watch the Brat Pack documentary? It streams on Hulu from Thursday, June 13, 2024. The film is a journey that starts with the filmmaker wearing an albatross around his neck. By the end of the documentary, you can see on McCarthy's face that he is lighter and he is visibly in a different place.\n\n\"That's probably true in a certain way,\" McCarthy confirmed. \"It was a journey of coming to terms with something that was a seismic event in my life. There's a moment in the movie where I'm just sitting in the car, and I can't remember exactly what I said, but just knowing that other people felt the same way about this was really important. That meant I wasn't alone. I kept saying to myself that the movie takes place now. It's not about something that took place over 35 years ago; it's about my relationship now to what happened back then.\"\n\nHowever, Brats could have been over before it began. It could have gone nowhere. McCarthy knew that when he started the camera rolling but did it anyway.\n\n\"I went out one day to film. Just one day. One of the things about the movie, and I kept saying this to everyone involved, was that this was a homemade movie. I said, 'We're going to show cameras, there's going to be no makeup, and when I call somebody up, I'm calling somebody up. There's no artifice in this.' I said, 'Let's go out for one day; I'll sit on a stoop and talk about what I felt about the Brat Pack. I don't know what I'll say, but I've thought about it for most of my life, so something will come out. Then I'm going to call everybody up,\" the filmmaker recalled. \"I was like, 'I've got everybody's number, so I'm going to call them all up on that day, and we'll film it and see what happens.' If nothing happened, then I would have eaten the day of filming, and that would have been that. It absolutely would have ended there.\"\n\nAs we see in the documentary, McCarthy started calling.\n\n\"Who called back first? Emilio. He called me back right there on the street and said yes, and that's in the film. I was shocked. Ally called me back about minutes later. Emilio never talks about this stuff, so when he said yes, I was like, 'Oh. We might have a movie.' A couple of days later, I talked to Rob and then Demi. When Ally called back, she said, 'I can do it today, right now.' I don't have a film crew, so I went and quickly rented two cameras, put them each on a tripod, put my iPhone up, and I and Ally had a conversation alone in their apartment.\"\n\n\"Until then, I didn't see how this would ever happen because everyone did not want to discuss it. I thought, 'I'll try it. I'm taking it one inch at a time, and I'll see if it sprouts roots.' I wasn't reluctant; I was eager, but I didn't imagine anyone would do it. When Emilio said yes, I was shocked, and then when Demi was like, 'Come on out tomorrow,' I was like, 'Shit. I can't.' She was going to Paris for two months, so she was like, 'You'd better hurry up.'\"\n\nWhen things started to move, the actor, known for movies like St Elmo's Fire, Pretty in Pink, and Mannequin, was clear about what he did and didn't want Brats to be. The goal was low-fi, honest authenticity.\n\n\"I was like, 'I want to come to your house with as few people as possible and just talk to you. I don't have a list of questions.' I did not want to make a talking head movie with stilted, canned answers, or canned questions,\" he told me. \"I can't remember who it was, but they asked, 'Do you have a list of questions you want to send me first?' I was like, 'I have no idea. I want to come to you because I don't know you, yet we share something very seismic in both of our lives. I'm sure we have something to talk about. If you're willing to go on to that topic, I'll show up.'\"\n\nMcCarthy didn't want to have interviews; he wanted to have conversations \"and share as openly and intimately as we could.\"\n\n\"That's the only thing that would have had any value to me. Even if people weren't willing to be open, and some people didn't want to talk, that says something, and that's fine, too. There was no judging. This sounds cheesy, but the movie was made with love for everybody.\"\n\nMost people who were in the Brat Pack or \"Brat Pack adjacent,\" such as Some Kind of Wonderful actress Lea Thompson, Pretty in Pink's Jon Cryer, and Taps' Timothy Hutton, also agreed to be part of the documentary; however, others, such as The Breakfast Club's Judd Nelson and Molly Ringwald, declined, although McCarthy offered to show them the documentary and invited them to Brats' Tribeca premiere.\n\nOne interview that McCarthy went into, not knowing where it would take him, was a conversation with David Blum, the journalist who wrote the article that coined and created the Brat Pack label.\n\n\"I had no idea what to expect. I was surprised by how much affection we had in the other conversations, but I had no idea what to expect from David. He was fascinating to me,\" the filmmaker said. \"All I knew was I didn't want to do a gotcha on him the way he did it on us. That was the midst of the 80s. Snark journalism was quintessential, and in New York Magazine, it was very that way back then. He came up with a great phrase. I wanted to let him have his say, and I think he was one second apologetic and the next second defiant.\"\n\n\"One of the interesting moments to me is when he's reacting, talking about on the Donahue show when the critic Richard Schickel said something about David that he perceived to be nasty, and he was deeply offended. I was gobsmacked and like, 'Uh huh. You're not even seeing the irony of this, David?' I just wanted to let him talk. At the end of it, I had this affection for him. That was seismic and a huge surprise to me, this journey from loathing this person to having affection for him over time.\"\n\nThere's a moment in Brats where McCarthy is ordering food, and the young person serving him, just off camera, asks what they are filming. He explains that it's a documentary about a group of actors from the 80s called the Brat Pack. They're polite but don't seem particularly interested or impressed. That made the Weekend at Bernie's star think.\n\n\"I turned 60 last year, and your relation to time changes when that happens. Maybe it happened for you at 50 a little bit, but it didn't happen for me. That person behind the counter was part of a much younger generation, so the Brat Pack didn't mean anything. It was some vague ancient history to them, but it still lives inside me in a certain way,\" he mused. \"Nostalgia is looking back through rose-colored glasses and deliberately deceiving ourselves about a time to feel better about our present. I spoke to Rob Lowe about this in the film, and he said we've become the avatars of youth for a generation. They look at us, and they see themselves. When I saw Rob for the first time in 30 years, I finally saw what everybody else saw when they saw me. I was like, 'Oh, my God, I'm seeing myself at 20 years old, and I'm having affection for my youth again.' It feels so warm and so nice.\"\n\n\"People come up and see me or other members of the Brat Pack, and they talk about how they love their movies, and their eyes glaze over. They're not talking to me anymore. They're talking about that wonderful moment in their own life when they were just cusping adulthood because that's a thrilling time in life. I, and the others, represent that to people. As we get older, that becomes even more important to a certain segment of the population. In reality, that young person behind the counter is right when they're like, 'Oh, that's just ancient f**king history.'\"\n\nMany of the people McCarthy interviewed for Brats had already had that realization, but he gets it now. For the first time, he's at peace. Looking back, they might all have handled it a little differently, but the fact remains that Hollywood wasn't ready for them even though they were ready for Hollywood.\n\n\"We represented this seismic cultural change that was happening. I didn't understand that before I made Brats,\" the Less Than Zero actor reflected. \"Movies were not about young people until that moment in time; they were about grown-ups before then, like The French Connection or The Godfather, and then suddenly, Hollywood discovers that kids go to movies five or six times and grown-ups go once. They were like, 'F**k this! Let's make movies for kids.' Overnight, teen movies were being made, and every Friday, there was a new movie for teenagers that was landing in theaters. The old guard in Hollywood was not too pleased about it. They were like, 'Who are these f**king punks? Everything's about them,' and then this article puts a label on us, a great zippy title; it captures the seismic cultural shift happening, and the old guard and Hollywood go, 'See? Little f**king punks.' We instantly reacted to their reaction and said, 'See? They resent us,' and from there it grew.\"\n\n\"The public didn't see any of that because they're not in showbusiness; they were home in Ohio and were going, 'I love these guys. They are in all these movies, and their name is the Brat Pack. I love that. It's easy to remember,' and boom. It took me decades to go, 'Oh, wait a minute.' I thought people had a reaction, whereas these people understood something that I didn't. I was reacting, and there was a big difference between reacting and understanding. It took me a long time to ultimately get that they were right.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That's what his new documentary, Brats, lays out before turning into something else: an opportunity for McCarthy to catch up with the audience and embrace how the term Brat Pack embalmed them in a seismic and precious pop-cultural moment.\n\nBrats is a personal journey, with camera in tow, for the actor who played the gentle but daft heartthrob opposite Molly Ringwald in Pretty in Pink and the forlorn one in the brattiest ensemble of them all, St Elmo's Fire. The audience rides shotgun as McCarthy reunites with fellow Brat Packers like Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy and Demi Moore. They therapize themselves and that moment (Moore is especially good at this), while it dawns on McCarthy what he and his castmates meant to the generation of mall rats from the 80s weaned on Pink Floyd and John Hughes coming-of-age movies.\n\n\"There's no more wondrous moment in life than when you're coming of age and blossoming,\" says McCarthy, on a Zoom call with the Guardian. \"We represent that for people.\"\n\nHe's reflecting on those 80s youth movies - like Fast Times at Ridgemont High and The Breakfast Club - that grew ubiquitous when Hollywood realized how often teens go to the movies. McCarthy, who made his screen debut starring opposite Rob Lowe in the 1980 movie Class (think The Graduate meets Meatballs), became a fixture alongside his contemporaries for young audiences who saw in those movies some idealized reflection of what they were experiencing at the time. \"When they look at me, they see their own youth,\" he says.\n\nMcCarthy is on the call from his house in New York, his brown eyeglass frames matching the exposed brick wall behind him. We're talking about how he and his former castmates felt aggrieved by that June 1985 New York Magazine cover story, which was the outcome of Estevez trusting a journalist with a little too much access. Nearly four decades later, McCarthy made a movie about it.\n\nThere's little chance the conversation I'm having with McCarthy will be made into a movie. There isn't as much room for anything sensational coming out of the more common and rigid confines of our interview - 20 minutes under the watchful eye of a publicist with McCarthy being careful not to let me lead him too far from his comfortable talking points. It's a far cry from the refreshingly unwieldy circumstances that led to David Blum's salacious New York Magazine piece. \"I don't think a journalist has been allowed to go out for drinks with a subject since,\" says McCarthy.\n\nBrats is a reclamation story, an attempt by McCarthy to wrestle his narrative back from Blum's piece, which began as a profile on Emilio Estevez and then grew into a witty, incisive and - in parts - cruelly unflattering assessment of a new breed of 80s movie stars.\n\nEstevez invited Blum to join him and his St Elmo's Fire co-stars Judd Nelson and Lowe for a night on the town. Blum subsequently reported on the way the stars cravenly sought attention and entertained groupies (and a Playboy Playmate of the Month). He observed them as entitled and narcissistic movie stars who had no professional acting or theatre training, who were commonly working together in ensembles targeting young audiences and who (much like their characters) were partying together like the Rat Pack once did. Blum dubbed Estevez, Lowe and Nelson - as well as Tom Cruise, Sean Penn and Matthew Broderick, among others - \"the Brat Pack\", articulating that these stars captured the zeitgeist by playing extensions of themselves, members of the lost and unambitious generation portrayed in St Elmo's Fire.\n\nThe story caught fire and the label stuck, but not just to the guys the article was about. Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Demi Moore aren't even mentioned in the male-dominated New York Magazine story but became guilty by association. McCarthy is only mentioned once - in an unkind quote where one of his co-stars who remains unidentified suggests the theatre actor from New York is too intense and won't make it. Yet he too became a core fixture of the Brat Pack according to a public that largely made it about the actors appearing in The Breakfast Club or St Elmo's Fire or both - though the defining lines tend to shift.\n\n\"The Brat Pack is who people say it is,\" says McCarthy, \"because the Brat Pack never 'existed' in any real way. It's more an idea of young actors who'd taken over Hollywood - we were the ones that were doing that at that moment, so we're in the Brat Pack.\"\n\nThe so-called Brat Pack responded to the article by largely having nothing to do with each other, going their separate ways so that they wouldn't validate the claims about their insularity. In Brats, Estevez admits kiboshing working with McCarthy on a planned adaptation of Young Men with Unlimited Capital, the story of the men behind Woodstock. That was his attempt to escape a label that he once told the Guardian will end up on his tombstone.\n\nFor obvious reasons, I'm taken by the bits in McCarthy's film that work as an anthropological look at celebrity journalism: the give and take between the stars and writers relishing their proximity to fame; the trust, defensiveness and performativity in these conversations; and how that's evolved over time, perhaps as a result of Blum's piece.\n\n\"That doesn't interest me very much particularly,\" says McCarthy, a point he repeats a couple more times during our conversation, even though his movie, about the way a piece of journalism affected his life, features several talking heads from the media, including Blum himself.\n\n\"I was just interested in how I knew it affected me on a personal level,\" says McCarthy, speaking to his film as a whole and that reunion with Blum. \"For X amount of years, I would have said: 'I hated this guy.' He wrote a hatchet job ... It was a scathing condemnation of these young people.' And I'd still say that to his face. But now none of that matters anymore. I actually sat across a table from him and had affection for him.\n\n\"He was just a young kid, trying to get his next job and trying to come up with something witty. That was the height of 80s snark New York Magazine journalism. That's what they did; that kind of 'gotcha'. That's all he was trying to do.\"\n\nTrying to find a modern-day equivalent to the Brat Pack phenomenon, I mention the \"nepo baby\" discourse, the observation that gained traction on social media that so many of the new generation of stars - like Emma Roberts and Maya Hawke - are the children of celebrities. New York Magazine even had a cover story discussing how the term rankled the young stars the way \"Brat Pack\" still irks Estevez, an original nepo baby.\n\n\"They'd love to have lightning strike twice,\" says McCarthy of New York Magazine's nepo baby cover, before dismissing the comparison. He argues that nothing today could compete with the phenomenon the Brat Pack story became because we no longer live in a monoculture where everyone watches - or is at least aware of - the same movies and are consuming the same media.\n\n\"If it had come out now, with my own socials, I could have pushed back,\" says McCarthy. \"I could have pushed back and created my own narrative. We had no way to create a narrative at all.\n\n\"That was a narrative that this guy [created] and it was so good, so witty and so clever that other people just grabbed. [They] picked it up on the wire, put it in their newspapers. Literally within a week, the world is saying: 'You're the Brat Pack.' We're like: 'What?!'\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type":

We all hated it,\" McCarthy told Good Morning America this week. \"Who wants to be called a brat when you're a kid?

I hadn't seen most of them in about 30 years. It was such a seminal moment in all our lives and none of us had ever talked about it before, so I just thought it'd be good to sort of go see what everybody felt about it.\"\n\nHe added that despite initially hating the moniker, some in the group have a different view all these years later.\n\n\"As you get old, you start to look back on your past in a different way and go, 'You know, that was a beautiful thing.'\"\n\nMcCarthy said he hadn't seen some members of the Brat Pack in 30 years.\n\n\"Rob [Lowe] and I walk into, you know, he walks into the room and I hug him, and he's like 'How long has it been,' and I'm like, 'I think 30 years.'\"\n\nHe said he hadn't seen Emilio Estevez since the premiere night of \"St. Elmo's Fire.\"\n\nDavid Blum of New York Magazine first coined the term Brat Pack in 1985 when he compared the teen stars to the infamous Rat Pack.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nThe stars, who came of age in the 1980s with movies like \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"About Last Night...,\" \"Sixteen Candles\" and \"Pretty in Pink,\" defined a generation's teen angst and became a pop culture touchstone.\n\nAlong with McCarthy, the Brat Pack members include Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald, Lowe, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Estevez and Jon Cryer, among others. However, which actors fit into the group hasn't always been clear.\n\nNelson told Us Weekly earlier this year that he wasn't interested in reminiscing with the others.\n\n\"I don't even know who's in the Brat Pack,\" the 64-year-old told the outlet in March, adding that he \"politely declined\" a request to be part of the documentary. \"It's like, why kind of rebirth something that wasn't necessarily fun? ... How can we be experts on something that didn't ever really exist?\"\n\nHe added, \"It seems strange to have that subject matter be something for edited entertainment. Also, like, he's a nice guy, but I hadn't seen him in 35 years. And it's like, I'm not going to [be] like, 'Hey!' No, dude.\"\n\n\"Sixteen Candles\" star Molly Ringwald also decided not to participate in the documentary.\n\n\"She said she'd think about it and that was really the end of it,\" McCarthy told US Weekly.\n\nHe said Ringwald would have been a great addition to the film.\n\n\"She's so articulate and insightful about these things,\" he explained. \"The Brat Pack's a funny thing. It's like an octopus -- it has these long tentacles you still reach out, and you can either feel them as an embrace or as something [else]. People are at different places in their lives.\"\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Fox News Digital, Ringwald admitted she wasn't a big fan of it being called the Brat Pack, saying \"it didn't feel like a positive or fair moniker for sure. I found it objectifying.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nOne of the issues she had with being called a Brat Packer was they were always being lumped together and looked at as a unit.\n\n\"Everybody who was in those movies became a Brat Pack member,\" Ringwald said on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" in 1994.\n\n\"We did a couple movies together, but I didn't really hang out with a lot of those people, just because I was younger at the time. I mean, when I did 'Breakfast Club,' I was 15, 16 years old, and they were already in their 20s. . . . I was quite a bit younger, so when they were going out drinking and doing crazy stuff, I was going to school.\"\n\nAbout Nelson, McCarthy joked to Us Weekly, \"Judd [is], I think, in an undisclosed location, but we did speak.\"\n\nAnthony Michael Hall told Fox News Digital in September 2022 he \"didn't anticipate any of\" the fame that came with being in the Brat Pack, saying getting famous so quickly at 15 \"was challenging\" and \"certainly took some adjusting.\"\n\n\"The idea of being recognized, it's awkward for adults. But it's magnified at that age when you're already dealing with all kinds of insecurities. It was very challenging,\" Hall explained. \"I would joke, but it's true, that it took me probably 20 years to process being 15, because I had experienced so much in between. I'm certainly grateful for it, and I thank God for having strong, great parents.\"\n\n'THE OUTSIDERS' STARS TOM CRUISE, ROB LOWE, RALPH MACCHIO SEEN IN NEWLY RELEASED AUDITION FOOTAGE\n\nHall guessed that people clung to the Brat Pack myth because \"audiences want the actors that they watch together in projects to be actually connected in life\" and will come up to him as an adult asking how Nelson and Estevez are doing, even though he hasn't \"seen them in 14 years.\"\n\n\"It didn't exist. It was a media ploy. Whoever was the editor of New York Magazine at the time, it was a set-up: 'Let's get all these guys together and get them talking s---,'\" Hall told Insider in 2015. \"The truth is, in that time frame, I was at the very young end of that group. I was literally still in high school. When we did 'The Breakfast Club,' Emilio and Judd were in their early 20s, and they are going out and having beers, and I was a teen. So, when they did that article, I did feel that was a ploy to get all them yapping.\"\n\nLowe said the term seemingly made them \"interchangeable.\"\n\n\"It was used in an underhanded, veiled way to say, 'This group of actors are interchangeable, vacuous, long on ambition, short on talent and very entitled,'\" Lowe told Independent.ie in 2011. \"While that may have been true in doses for some people, it was a bad generalization.\"\n\nStill, in the book \"You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried,\" Lowe shared that \"the camaraderie was real\" on the set of \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and explained everyone on the cast \"truly liked and ended up close while we were filming.\"\n\nHe also explained in the Independent.ie interview why his perspective on the Brat Pack has changed over the years, stating, \"Now, there's no stigma left, and I totally embrace it.\"\n\n\"I realized my affection for them. You know, after all of us, everything we've been through, the different chapters in our lives - and I realized we grew up together,\" Lowe told Entertainment Tonight Canada in 2021.\n\n\"These are like the people I went to high school or the people I went to college with, and you reconnect with them in that way. And it was super sweet to have him and Demi on,\" he added of having Moore and McCarthy on his podcast, \"Literally.\"\n\nMcCarthy told GMA he was surprised that so many former Brats agreed to be part of the documentary, saying he didn't think many would want to talk about it \"even 10 years ago.\"\n\n\"And we were like the only members of this club, and so we're the only ones that know what it was like, so it was nice to sort of just go back,\" he said.\n\nDoug Eldridge of Achilles PR told Fox News Digital that being a Brat Pack member served as a launch pad for so many young actors.\n\nANTHONY MICHAEL HALL TURNS 55: BRAT PACK MEMBERS THEN AND NOW\n\n\"Helen of Troy was credited with being 'the face that launched a thousand ships,' referring to her beauty that led to the start of the Trojan War. It's no stretch to say that the Brat Pack was 'the group that launched a half dozen careers,'\" he said.\n\n\"Looking back at the core members, each of them found '80s mega-stardom following their Brat Pack membership. Emilio [Estevez] carried the 'Breakfast Club' and anchored the 'Young Guns' franchise. Molly [Ringwald] starred in 'Pretty in Pink,' 'Sixteen Candles' and a slew of other '80s hits.\n\n\"Demi did 'Ghost,' 'Indecent Proposal' and dozens of other films. Rob endured a PR roller coaster throughout the '90s but came back with 'Tommy Boy,' 'Parks & Rec' and a variety of TV dramas. While each of them had different trajectories and career arcs, all of them enjoyed the same launch pad.\"\n\nReflecting on if it was a \"good choice\" to be in the documentary, he said, \"This type of nostalgia is usually a marketable play, so long as it doesn't trash the foundational backstory that propelled them into popularity to begin with. 'The Mickey Mouse Club' is a similar example - [Justin] Timberlake, [Britney] Spears, [Ryan] Gosling and countless others got their start with the mouse troupe, yet few have had anything positive to say about the experience.\n\n\"The age of tell-all books and exclusive sit-down interviews - which take needless swipes at the parents, agents and advisers who helped develop iconic careers - always comes at a cost. By contrast, this type of behind-the-scenes 'remember when' is a comparatively better format, not only for these aging stars but the fan base who loved them then and now. For the same reason that 'VH-1 Storytellers' or DVD commentary and outtakes from the stars are always a popular feature, this too should do well.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMcCarthy said when fans who were young in the '80s come up to him on the street and start talking about Brat Pack movies, their eyes glaze over, and they say, \"'Oh! The Brat Pack,' and they start talking, and I realize they're not even looking at me anymore.\n\n\"They're talking to themselves and their own youth, and I've become sort of the avatar of their youth and other members of the Brat Pack.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brie_stimson@foxnews.com", "name": "Brie Stimson", "type":

Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, and Demi Moore had already done fine work in other films both together (Estevez, Sheedy, and Nelson had all been in \"The Breakfast Club\"; Lowe and McCarthy co-starred in \"Class\") and apart, but \"St. Elmo's Fire\" was the best showcase any of them had ever gotten, in an era when youth movies were better and more numerous than they had ever been before. Nothing stood in the way of their becoming the next generation of great American screen actors -- except for a New York magazine writer named David Blum.\n\nBlum spent a night out with Estevez and several of his friends for what was supposed to be a simple profile of the actor but turned into a cover story in which the journalist dubbed the entire group the \"Brat Pack\" and characterized them as spoiled partiers who didn't care about their craft. The catchy label took off and stuck to the actors -- as well as to others of their generation like Molly Ringwald -- and immediately changed their lives, mostly for the worse. They (correctly) feared that great directors would no longer take them seriously and passed up potentially great projects where they would have been reunited in an effort to flee from the Brat Pack moniker. Any camaraderie that did exist among the group was immediately destroyed.\n\nMcCarthy, who would go on to star in the iconic '80s youth movies \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"Less Than Zero\" before going on to a successful career as an episodic television director, justifiably hated Blum's article and ran from any association with the Brat Pack for years (though he did reunite with Ringwald for the underrated \"Fresh Horses\"). In 2021, however, he wrote a memoir wrestling with the Brat Pack and its legacy, and now he has directed the documentary \"Brats,\" a moving and funny look back at the era and its movies that's also something more: a meditation on the passage of time, and how the truth changes with perspective. \"How we relate to the experiences of our lives changes drastically over time,\" McCarthy told IndieWire. \"We're convinced it's one thing, and then later in life we can be convinced it's entirely other. And that's interesting to me.\"\n\nMcCarthy makes it interesting to the audience too, in a film that, for anyone who was a sentient moviegoer in the mid-'80s, immediately brings back what it was like to experience the explosion in youth films that yielded an abundance of genuinely great movies that have stood the test of time: \"Risky Business,\" \"The Outsiders,\" and John Hughes' output, among many others. \"There was a seismic cultural shift that happened at that moment in time,\" McCarthy said. \"Hollywood discovered that kids go to the movies half a dozen times, grown-ups go once. Fuck the grown-ups, let's make movies for kids. It happened overnight, and every Friday there was another movie about young kids, and every kid was going to see that movie.\"\n\nIn \"Brats,\" a convincing case is made for \"Ordinary People\" as the movie that kicked the trend off in 1980 -- it wasn't a youth movie, but it took teenagers seriously, an idea that John Hughes would run with a few years later. When Blum's article came out, it didn't put an end to youth movies, but it did change the way people looked at them, at least the ones starring actors designated as part of the Brat Pack. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn might have been taken seriously in \"The Falcon and the Snowman,\" but Lowe and Moore's equally rich performances in \"About Last Night\" were largely underrated (though a few astute critics like Roger Ebert took note), and when Estevez tried his hand at directing himself and his then-girlfriend Demi Moore in \"Wisdom,\" it was their relationship that was reviewed, not the movie.\n\nThe Brat Pack actors evolved with varying degrees of success in the years following -- Moore, for example, shed the label to become one of the biggest movie stars of the 1990s -- and McCarthy was curious about how their experiences compared to his. \"I knew my arc of my relationship to this,\" McCarthy said. \"I hated it when it first happened. I felt like it was stigmatizing and limiting. And over time I've grown to realize that I and other members of the Brad Pack are the avatars of youth for a generation. They look at us with such affection because they see their own youths and project their coming of age and what a wondrous time it is on to us. To realize what a gift that has been, that's a long journey from hating this thing to embracing it. I knew that was the arc of the movie, because that was the arc of my own experience. What I wanted was to see what other people's experience with it was. We were all in the same starting spot, but where did other people get with it?\"\n\nThus \"Brats\" takes on a kind of journey structure with McCarthy traveling around the country and interviewing other members of the \"Brat Pack,\" most of whom he hasn't seen in over 30 years. \"The biggest surprise to me is how much affection we all had for each other,\" McCarthy said. \"You know, when Rob and I were young, we were not particularly friendly. We were young and scared and competitive. Seeing him was the same experience that strangers on the street have when they come to me and their eyes light up and they go, 'Oh my God, my youth.' Rob walked in and I saw myself at 19 and I had a lot more affection for my own youth and my own mistakes, my foibles and fears.\" By juxtaposing the contemporary interviews with entertaining archival footage showing the actors in their heyday, McCarthy creates an inherently fascinating demonstration of the relationship between the past and present. \"I was not interested in a nostalgic romp. I was interested in our view of the past, and how the past is still alive in the present and how our present view of the past alters it.\"\n\nMcCarthy provides added context and depth by interviewing outside commentators (including IndieWire's own Kate Erbland, whose encyclopedic knowledge of 1980s cinema is put to good use here), but perhaps the most riveting interview is with the man who started it all, David Blum. Blum seems alternately apologetic and defensive and provides the movie's most jaw-dropping moment when he expresses hurt over film critic Richard Schickel speaking unkindly of him on a \"Donahue\" episode devoted to the Brat Pack. \"I just looked at him dumbfounded,\" McCarthy said. \"After what he wrote about us? Are you kidding dude?\" McCarthy was too stunned to challenge Blum but ultimately felt letting him have his say in a way that the actors in the Brat Pack themselves were never able to was the right way to go. \"I'm glad I just let him have his say, and in the end, the viewer can read whatever they want to into it.\"\n\nIn the end, McCarthy found that he liked Blum and that reconciling with him was just another part of his own journey, as chronicled in the film. \"When you're in the middle of something, sometimes you just can't see it,\" McCarthy said. \"I had so much shame about things. But people are still talking about 'Pretty in Pink.' John Hughes respected young people's feelings and that's why kids are still watching these movies. The hairdos were funny and the music is a little old-fashioned, but the emotional journeys are valid and the same as kids are having now. So I have a lot of respect for those movies in a way that I didn't when I was younger. I mean, how many movies are you still talking about 35 years later?\"", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_hemphill@indiewire.com",

As Emilio said [in the movie], we were kryptonite to each other in a certain way. I never thought of it the way he said it, but I thought that was quite accurate,\" said the actor, who went on to focus on directing and travel writing.\n\nMany of the key players agreed to rehash their shared past on camera for McCarthy -- but a few, including Judd Nelson, declined to participate.\n\n\"Any people that are or aren't in the film, I think that speaks to the proof of concept. People had different reactions to it, and they still do,\" the filmmaker explained. \"One of the first things I thought going into this was, 'I hope at least one person doesn't want to do this because it'll speak to how complicated it still is.\"\n\nHe further noted how his attitude towards the phrase has changed over the years and whether the pack plans to stay in touch after reconnecting.\n\nTheWrap: Was it cathartic to get back in touch with everybody else who was labeled a Brat Packer?\n\nAndrew McCarthy: I felt liberated, which is slightly different. But I achieved what I wanted to. I wasn't interested in a nostalgia romp, but I'm always very interested in how we reassess and make sense of our lives and how that changes over time. It was liberating in the sense that it brought the past to the present in a way that was rewarding.\n\nHow have your feelings about being part of the Brat Pack changed?\n\nAt the time, there was a seismic change happening in Hollywood. Young movies took over almost overnight, and we were at the forefront of that.\n\nSo there was a segment of the old guard that went, \"Who the hell are these punks?\"And then David Blum comes up with this really zippy phrase and they go, \"Oh, exactly. They're brats.\" It was always a very stigmatizing thing.\n\nWhereas the public was smarter than all of us and thought, \"No, we love these guys.\" That's what I didn't see for so long. They just wanted to grab this satchel of youth movies and run with it.\n\nWe were responding to what we felt was the industry reaction, whereas the public was responding to their own emotional needs, which are, \"I see these people in these movies and I identify with them.\" And we love that, that they saw themselves in us.\n\nYou meet with David Blum in the film and at one point he refers to the Brat Pack as \"collateral damage\" of his article.\n\nMy overriding feeling for David was affection, which was quite shocking. In the film, I say, \"You're someone who I felt did me such harm. And I look at you now with affection.\"\n\nDavid forgot about us very quickly, probably didn't think about us for a second when he was writing that. He just knew, \"I've got a great lede and this is a really good spin.\" And it was right at the time of that classic '80s snarky journalism, so was he thinking about the effect it would have?\n\nI think he says, \"No, it didn't actually occur to me.\" Once he had it, we stopped being people, we were just useful for the article. And that's what we can all be guilty of doing.\n\nJon Cryer was in \"Pretty in Pink,\" but he says he's not part of the Brat Pack.\n\nYou ask 10 people [and they will all say something different]. That's why we have that moment in the middle of the movie, like, \"Who's actually in the Brat Pack?\" And none of us know. It was always more of an idea.\n\nIt very much exists because we are still talking about it, but it wasn't a literal kind of thing. It existed as an idea and a concept, so I don't think it matters who's in it or not. I wasn't even in the article that David Blum wrote. I wasn't in the Brat Pack, according to him. [But people tell me], of course you're at the center of the Brat Pack at this point.\n\nThe truth is that I was an iconic member of the Brat Pack. The truth of 1985 is, no, I was excluded. So, which is right? They're both right.\n\nIt reminds me of Christopher Plummer, who hated \"The Sound of Music\" and the song \"Edelweiss\" for many years, and then he finally embraced it and was like, \"OK, it's part of who I am.\"\n\nAbsolutely. People come up to me on a daily basis and say, \"Oh, my God, those movies you made [mean so much to me].\" And I know they're really talking about themselves and their own youth and that wondrous moment the Brat Pack represents to a generation of people. If that's not a beautiful thing, I don't know what is.\n\nDo you think you will stay in touch with Demi and Rob and the other people you reconnected with?\n\nWell, I'm seeing Demi tonight, actually, and I was just texting with Rob yesterday. So we have so far. It's really nice.\n\nIs there a Brat Pack group text?\n\nNo, but we should get one going. That's a good idea. I don't actually know how to group chat. Somebody else would have to start it.", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharon_knolle@thewrap.com", "name": "Sharon Knolle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pretty in Pink (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk subculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edelweiss_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edelweiss (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sound of Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Plummer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Plummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/andrew-mccarthy-brats-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

While stars like Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Jon Cryer, and McCarthy himself are featured in the film, Ringwald's absence is noticeable.\n\nMcCarthy revealed that Ringwald was approached to participate in the documentary, but she simply said she would think about it and did not further engage with the project. Despite her absence, McCarthy acknowledged that Ringwald had already shared her thoughts on the Brat Pack in archival footage from previous interviews. He expressed regret that he was not able to have a direct conversation with her, noting her articulate and insightful nature.\n\nThe documentary follows McCarthy as he reconnects with his former peers, some of whom he had not seen in decades, like Estevez. While stars like Rob Lowe, Sheedy, and Moore share their insights on-screen, the absence of Ringwald and Nelson is notable. McCarthy explained that he would have liked to speak with more people about their experiences in the Brat Pack, but time and financial constraints limited his ability to do so.\n\nIn a recent interview with Variety, Ringwald discussed how the Brat Pack label had limited her career opportunities at the time. She expressed frustration that the label was used to dismiss actors when they attempted to transition to more adult roles. Despite this, Ringwald has continued to have a successful career with roles in various TV shows and films, including the Netflix \"Kissing Booth\" franchise and Ryan Murphy's projects.\n\nWhile Ringwald may have moved on from her teenage roles, her impact as a member of the Brat Pack continues to be felt in the entertainment industry.

Nelson and Ringwald were two of a handful of actors in \"The Brat Pack.\"\n\n\"I mean, they both are in the film in a sense that there's a lot of clips and interviews and things,\" the Pretty in Pink star said. Ringwald and Nelson both appear in the film via archival footage and clips from the height of their fame in the '80s. Nelson also makes a brief appearance through a phone call at the end of the movie.\n\nMcCarthy continued, \"The Brat Pack is an ongoing relationship, you know what I mean? And some people are at different places in their lives to want to or not want to talk about it. I think that just informs it even more. I mean, that's my takeaway from it.\"\n\nThe St. Elmo's Fire star, who has picked up more jobs behind the camera in recent years on shows like Orange Is the New Black and The Sinner as well as the feature-film documentary he is currently promoting, joked with ET that while he was excited to begin the filmmaking process on Brats, he feared being spurned by all those he reached out to.\n\n\"I was surprised as many people would want to speak to me [that] did, you know, because I thought the biggest challenge would be to get people to participate,\" he quipped. \"I knew it was still so sort of dodgy in some people's lives.\"\n\nWhile Nelson and Ringwald opted out, McCarthy was able to get Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy and Rob Lowe to appear. He also brought in \"Brat Pack\" adjacent stars like his Pretty In Pink co-star, Jon Cryer, and Back to the Future actress Lea Thompson. The term applies to the teen actors from the '80s who seemingly ran Hollywood thanks to their slate of massive films like The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, Pretty in Pink and more.\n\nMcCarthy said that while some who tune in for the documentary may see the final scene as a tease for a potential sequel, he is pretty confident one Brats film is enough for the group of actors who spent the majority of their foundational years in the spotlight.\n\n\"We're getting ready for part two,\" he joked, adding that for the gang who came together to unpack their trauma, \"I think once was enough.\"\n\nBack in May 2023, McCarthy spoke with ET and revealed that he reunited with his Brat Pack pals, Lowe and Estevez, for the documentary on the '80s crew. He kept details up his sleeve at the time but shared that he was excited for the world to see the project.\n\n\"It seems crazy,\" McCarthy said when asked about their reunion. \"I went back and started hunting everybody down again and we just hadn't seen each other in all these [decades].

Throughout the film, McCarthy is seen trying to get both Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson to participate in the documentary ... without success.\n\n\"I, of course, asked Molly if she'd like to speak and she said she'd think about it but she would probably like to just keep looking forward,\" McCarthy told Cryer at one point in the doc. \"I think Molly wants to move on,\" Jon responded, acknowledging that \"we all want to be taken without the baggage of our pop cultural references. As an actor we want to just act. \"\n\nWhile McCarthy said nobody even had a phone number for Judd, he eventually got one through a manager, but was unable to connect with him. \"Judd is at an undisclosed location and not available,\" said Andrew -- who is seen finally answering a (likely fake) call from Nelson in the credits.\n\nSetting the scene for the doc, McCarthy explained the \"Brat Pack\" label came thanks to what was initially supposed to be a profile about Emilio Estevez. The actor, however, took the writer out for a night on the town with Rob Lowe and Judd Nelson and the focus shifted a bit to the whole group of young stars whose profiles were on the rise at the time.\n\n\"I just remember seeing that cover and thinking, 'Oh, f--k,' I thought it was terrible, instantly,\" recalled McCarthy. \"The article was scathing ... from then on ... [we were] branded without any wiggle room as the Brat Pack.\"\n\nThe purpose of the doc, per McCarthy, was to check in with others in the \"Pack\" to \"see what their experience was at that time and what it's come to mean decades later.\" His first visit was Estevez, who he hadn't seen since the premiere of St. Elmo's Fire.\n\nEstevez explained the New York Magazine article was his first real profile and admitted \"it was naive of me to think this journalist would in fact be my friend.\" He said that when the article came out, he \"felt derailed,\" and said the fallout from the piece made him decide against doing a movie with McCarthy at the time, despite it being \"one of the best scripts I'd read in a long time,.\"\n\n\"They told me you didn't want to do it,\" said McCarthy, before Estevez assured him it wasn't a personal decision. \"I didn't want to have anything to do with any of us. Working together, it almost felt like we were kryptonite,\" he explained, saying he still turns down doing retrospectives about films from that stage of his career.\n\n\"I'm not interested in dredging up the past. If you're too busy looking in your rear-view window, you're going to stumble,\" Estevez added, before being asked whether he'd prefer the group's label didn't exist.\n\n\"That's a difficult question to answer. Was it something that we benefited from? Maybe. But in the long run, I think we did not,\" said Emilio. \"I think there was more damage done by it than good. It created the perception we were lightweights, we didn't take it seriously.\"\n\nMcCarthy agreed, saying Martin Scorsese wasn't going to call up someone from the \"Brat Pack\" for a role.\n\nWhen McCarthy sat down with Ally Sheedy, he admitted he \"had a crush\" on her back in the day. Sheedy was shocked, exclaiming, \"You did not, Andrew! You did not!\" He told her that he was \"so scared\" and \"busy being aloof\" at the time to do anything about it, with Sheedy agreeing he was, in fact, \"aloof.\"\n\nShe went on to say The Breakfast Club was the project that keeps on giving, sharing how much she loved the experience of that film. \"In high school I did not have many close friends ... it still astonishes me how many people found themselves in that film,\" she shared.\n\nWhile they both agreed the '80s were a thrilling and exciting time, Sheedy said \"it all stopped\" after the Brat Pack article came out. \"We kept working, but there was this feeling ... it was being shell-shocked. I started feeling this weird vibe in the room if I went in to audition for something, just a weirdness,\" she recalled.\n\n\"It felt like, let's just write off everybody's lives, experiences, their work, it's getting written off,\" she said, while McCarthy said it felt like they were all \"members of a club we never asked to join.\"\n\nSheedy, however, added that she was \"really grateful\" for the connections she made with her peers.\n\n\"The fondness I feel for everybody, that's real, that's genuine,\" she told McCarthy. \"It was a complicated time, really complicated time, but the good memories I have are deep and they're in there. So if somebody said, was it worth it? Yes, it was.\"\n\nAs McCarthy visited Demi Moore at her home, she spoke about the support she received from St. Elmo's Fire director Joel Schumacher when they were working on the film.\n\n\"It's not like I had any box-office draw. You know, we were all just beginning. We were all just beginning. I didn't have anything to warrant him sticking by me,\" said Moore, who has been open about her issues with substance abuse in her memoir. \"They paid to have a sober companion with me 24/7, during the whole shooting. They could have easily just found someone else.\"\n\nMcCarthy said he never noticed her \"companion\" on set at the time.\n\nOf the \"Brat Pack\" article, Moore recalled her initial reaction also being, \"What the f--k?\"\n\n\"It definitely really irritated me. I felt a sense of it being unjust. I felt it didn't represent us and I felt it was a real limited perspective,\" said Moore. \"It stayed with me for a while. But I don't know if I took it as personal over time, as you did, or the impact you may have had from it.\"\n\n\"The fact that it came out and tried to diminish us, was also an opportunity to rise above, to say I am much more than that,\" she said of how she was able to get past the label -- something McCarthy said took him years to accomplish. \"When we hold things that way, we create that pattern. You're predisposed to re-creating it,\" she added.\n\nWhen McCarthy met up with Rob Lowe -- who Andrew said he was \"fairly competitive\" with and \"not close\" to back in the day -- they opened up about a night they followed Liza Minnelli to Rat Pack-er Sammy Davis Jr.'s place one night after grabbing food at Spago.\n\n\"He was so gracious. He was long sober but playing bartender. I was getting drunker and drunker. Me and Sammy are splitting cigarettes,\" recalled McCarthy. \"He was like, I got my eye on you cats, I love what you're doing. It was the only time in my experience when the Brat Pack met the Rat Pack.\"\n\nOf the group's label, Lowe said \"no one liked\" it.\n\n\"There's always gonna be some perception that bumps up against how you see yourself and what you think you can do as an actor,\" he continued. \"I don't want to come off seeming like I'm so Pollyanna that I don't realize or didn't know at the time what a f--king disaster and how mean-spirited and what an attempt that was to minimize all of our talents. I get why it happened, there's too many of us, there had to be a catchall name.\"\n\nHe went on to theorize the popularity of the Brat Pack, however, caused a shift in Hollywood and a pivot toward content aimed at a younger audience. He pointed to the success of YA shows and networks like The CW, something Andrew hadn't realized previously.\n\nLowe also said it's \"a really, really special thing\" to be part of anything people still want to talk about 30+ years later, adding that every generation has its own group of young stars who find themselves thrust into the spotlight. After speaking with Lowe, McCarthy said he was happy how much \"lightness\" they have when they look back on that time now.\n\nToward the end of the doc, McCarthy sat down with Dave Blum, the man who wrote the article labeling them all the \"Brat Pack.\"\n\n\"I was just able to observe,\" he said of his night out with Estevez and friends, adding that he didn't dislike any of them and felt they were all nice. \"I didn't think at the time, 'These brats,' at all,\" he said, adding that he thought the name was just a \"fun\" title for the article.\n\nHe explained that it came to him after he and a group of journalists jokingly referred to themselves as the \"fat pack\" during his trip to Los Angeles for the piece.\n\n\"It didn't cross my mind that it was all that big a deal,\" he added, before McCarthy asked whether he felt the article was \"scathing.\"\n\n\"I guess in retrospect, yes. At the time, no. I was proud of my creation of the phrase. Look, I was 29, I definitely knew it was gonna have a reaction,\" said Blum, as McCarthy let him know how much it affected him at the time.\n\n\"I just remember seeing that cover and going, what just happened? I'd lost the narrative of my career,\" said the actor. \"What really upset me is [how it made it seem they were] not that interested in doing the craft of it, they want to be famous and party. I took offense to that. It felt like, to me, we have to reposition this or get away from this. It wasn't perceived in the industry as a compliment.\"\n\nWhile Blum felt he was \"not wrong\" in deciding to highlight that group, who went on to become very successful, McCarthy pushed back, saying he didn't write the article \"with any affection.\"\n\n\"You were all adults. There's tradeoffs to being a celebrity. Some of it is positive. These people wanted to be written about, these people agreed to talk to me, I'm doing my job as a journalist. It wasn't meant to hurt anyone, but to define a group in a clever and interesting way,\" Blum said, defending himself while also admitting there were parts of the piece that were simply mean and not nice.\n\n\"I was just trying to be funny. I have no regrets, I'm glad it's lived on forever, but I hope it's not the greatest thing I ever did,\" he added, saying that he wouldn't do anything differently.\n\nAfter the pair hugged it out, McCarthy once again asked, \"Do you think you could have been nicer?\" -- with Blum responding, \"I guess I feel like, sticks and stones.\"\n\nWhile it's clear everyone knows the term \"Brat Pack,\" there's some debate about who's actually part of it.\n\n\"The Brat Pack was just us,\" said Moore, seemingly referring to the cast of St. Elmo's Fire. When McCarthy noted that many people think Ringwald is also part of the group, Demi seemed surprised -- exclaiming, \"Really?\"\n\nEstevez also said Jon Cryer was part of the group, though Cryer himself was seen on camera saying, \"I am not in the Brat Pack.\" Others also wondered whether Tom Cruise or Matt Dillon would also be considered part of the group, with Lea Thompson -- who admitted she was only \"Brat Pack-adjacent\" -- saying Cruise definitely wasn't.\n\nThe commonly accepted group: Judd, Emilio, Andrew, Molly, Ally, Rob and Demi.", "source": {"uri": "toofab.com", "dataType":

Inside that surprise...", "body": "Judd Nelson wants nothing to do with the Brat Pack -- or does he?\n\nThe \"St. Elmo's Fire\" star, 64, turned down former co-star Andrew McCarthy's offer to appear in the new Hulu documentary, \"Brats,\" about the '80s-era group of actors.\n\nBut Nelson seemingly makes a cameo -- though only over the phone -- at the very end of the doc.\n\nJust before the credits roll on \"Brats,\" McCarthy, who wrote, directed, and stars in the project, is standing on a dock and answers a phone call.\n\n\"Hello? Judd?\" says McCarthy, 61.\n\nThere's been no confirmation that Nelson was on the other end of that phone call.\n\n\"Brats,\" released June 13 on Hulu, follows McCarthy as he seeks out his former peers that he starred in an ensemble of movies with in the 1980s including \"St. Elmos Fire,\" \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"Sixteen Candles.\"\n\nThe circle of stars associated with the Brat Pack label, which was dubbed in a 1985 New York magazine article, include Nelson, McCarthy, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall and Molly Ringwald.\n\nNelson was one of the few Brat Pack members who refused to do the doc.\n\n\"It seems strange to have that subject matter be something for edited entertainment,\" Nelson told Us Weekly in March, adding that he \"politely declined\" McCarthy's offer to join the project.\n\n\"Also, like, he's a nice guy, but I hadn't seen him in 35 years,\" Nelson added about his fellow Brat Packer. \"And it's like, I'm not going to [be] like, 'Hey!' No, dude.\"\n\nThe \"Billionaire Boys Club\" actor also denied that the Brat Pack was ever actually a thing.\n\n\"It's like, why kind of rebirth something that wasn't necessarily fun? ... How can we be experts on something that didn't ever really exist?\" he said. \"What was so strange is I lived in New York, then I did a movie with people out here [in L.A.]. \"So it's like, then I'm hanging out with them ... then when the movie's over, I go back to New York. I'm not going to hang [and be like], 'Hey, let's go to Hard Rock Cafe.' It's weird.\"\n\nNelson previously talked about his hatred for the Brat Pack title on \"The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast\" in 2015.\n\n\"These were people I worked with, who I really liked as people -- funny, smart, committed to the work. I mean, no one was professionally irresponsible. And after that article, not only are we strongly encouraged not to work with each other again -- and for the most part we haven't -- but it was insinuated we might not want to be hanging out with these people. And it was like, I didn't know that good friends are so easy to come by in this world that they should be tossed asunder.\"\n\n\"And to think that we're some kind of gang, or group!\" Nelson added. \"I lived in New York City. I don't go three thousand miles to have a beer. ... But it just seemed like we were like fruit picked too soon, and then blamed for being picked too soon.\"\n\nRingwald, 56, similarly turned down an offer to be in \"Brats.\"\n\n\"I asked Molly if she liked to speak,\" McCarthy noted onscreen. \"She said she'd think about it, but she'd like to just keep looking forward.\"\n\nWhile promoting the documentary, McCarthy spoke to Entertainment Tonight about Nelson and Ringwald's decisions to skip the doc.\n\n\"I mean, they both are in the film in a sense that there's a lot of clips and interviews and things,\" McCarthy said.\n\nThe \"Weekend at Bernie's\" actor added: \"The Brat Pack is an ongoing relationship, you know what I mean? And some people are at different places in their lives to want to or not want to talk about it. I think that just informs it even more. I mean, that's my takeaway from it.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelson (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

The stigma, McCarthy says, was \"defining.\" He has PTSD, he suggests.\n\nHe's 61 now, well-off and trim. He has many accomplishments as an actor but there's this one thing he finds hard to shake: Back in 1985, he got called something.\n\nDuring the Reagan administration, rising star Andrew McCarthy was lumped into an amorphous group of young actors who were changing Hollywood. They were called the \"Brat Pack.\"\n\nNow, it's never nice to be called a \"brat\" or to lose your individuality to a pack, but McCarthy and the members of this collective -- Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe and maybe Anthony Michael Hall -- seemed to implode.\n\n\"That changed my life,\" says McCarthy, who starred in \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" After being branded, the so-called bratty actors scattered, not wanting to work together again. The stigma, McCarthy says, was \"defining.\" He has PTSD, he suggests.\n\nNow almost 40 years later, McCarthy hit the road to star in and direct his new Hulu documentary, \"Brats,\" trying to get a handle on the label and how some of the pack handled it.\n\nFirst stop is a wary Estevez, who acknowledges that the Brat Pack term had some early benefits but was ultimately \"more damage than good.\"\n\n\"It created the perception that we were lightweights,\" he adds.\n\nThen there are visits to Sheedy, Moore, Lowe, Jon Cryer, Tim Hutton and Lea Thompson -- all who commiserate with McCarthy. (Ringwald and Nelson are notable absences, perhaps still nursing wounds.) These visits have the feeling of therapy sessions.\n\n\"Marty Scorsese, Steven Spielberg is not going to call up somebody who's in the Brat Pack,\" McCarthy tells Estevez, who admits to pulling out of a movie at the prospect of teaming up with McCarthy.\n\n(Not to be rude, but the Brat Pack-adjacent Tom Cruise did a movie with Scorsese, \"The Color of Money,\" Moore became the hottest thing in Hollywood in the '90s and Robert Downey Jr., also Pack-adjacent, just took home an Oscar.)\n\nAs he pays one former colleague after another a visit at their well-appointed homes, the heat of injustice has dissipated. Moore's estate with its tasteful wood panels, shaded pool, massive glass walls and Japanese-inspired minimalism doesn't exactly scream, \"That label from 1985 really destroyed my life.\"\n\nThe doc is scored well, with songs by The Cure, Lou Reed and Steve Winwood, \"Forever Young\" by Alphaville and a haunting \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" cover by Zoe Fox and the Rocket Clocks.\n\nBut McCarthy's visual style is too fragmented, happy to capture his scrambling camera and sound operators in the frame and changing up his shots from guerilla-style jerky iPhone images to tasteful, polished portraits. His use of old clips is excellent, incorporating not just scenes from movies but TV interview outtakes, too.\n\nA more interesting thing happens in McCarthy's road movie by the halfway mark -- it becomes a sort of celebration of Brat Pack movies. Cultural observer Malcolm Gladwell talks about the generational transition in Hollywood, while Susannah Gora, who wrote \"You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried\" about the Brat Pack's impact, notes that teens in the Midwest were singing British New Wave synth-pop tunes thanks to McCarthy.\n\nPop culture critic Ira Madison III zeroes in on the lack of diversity in Brat Pack movies, \"Less Than Zero\" writer Bret Easton Ellis notes the influence the movies had on his work, and screenwriter Michael Oates Palmer comments that Brat Pack movies were the first to take \"young people's lives seriously.\"\n\nThese are the building blocks of a better movie -- Gladwell cutely mentions that he used parts of Cryer's character Duckie from \"Pretty in Pink\" as his identity in high school -- but McCarthy isn't willing to stray.\n\nHe comes across as a very thoughtful guy, able to quote Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill, reserved, shy and wry, so often deep in his feelings. But this bratty label he cannot shake. He also wrote about it in \"Brat: An '80s Story.\" It is his Moby Dick.\n\nThat analogy works when he finally harpoons his white whale -- David Blum, who at 29 in 1985, hoping to snag some attention in the journalism world, coined the phrase \"Brat Pack\" -- a flip play on the Rat Pack -- for New York magazine.\n\nMcCarthy sits down with Blum at the conclusion of the film -- the aggrieved actor and the journalist meeting for the first time four decades after being dragged into the '80s cultural lexicon. This is the \"You can't handle the truth\" moment.\n\nAnd yet McCarthy is so nice that while he makes his case well, he sort of also understands Blum's position and kind of likes him, too. Will Blum finally admit that the label is scathing? \"I mean, I guess in retrospect, yes. At the time, no. I was proud of the creation of the phrase,\" says the writer. They end their meeting with a hug.\n\nLike a Brat Pack movie.\n\n\"Brats,\" a Hulu release premiering Thursday, is not rated but has smoking, love scenes and swearing. Running time: 93 minutes. Two stars out of four.\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "source": {"uri": "sentinelcolorado.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sentinel Colorado"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The headline, Hollywood's Brat Pack -- a sideways reference to the clique of urbane rebel entertainers, including Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., who cool-strutted through Hollywood and Las Vegas in the 1960s -- had the catchy \u00e9lan that editors have always strived for, even before the clickbait era. But the subjects of the article -- and even those who were pointedly not its subject -- took umbrage, some carrying their mini-grudge well into the present day.\n\nOne of those grudge-holders is Brat Pack member Andrew McCarthy, and his a documentary, Brats -- which premiered at the Tribeca Festival and is now playing on Hulu -- examines how one clever headline nickname has, for better or worse, stuck to this group of actors for nearly four decades. Brats is so winsomely entertaining that it could have been made by one of the archetypically guileless characters McCarthy played in the '80s, like principled rich kid Blane of Pretty in Pink, or the sculptor-turned-window-decorator of Mannequin whose goddess-like creation comes to life. At the height of the Brat Pack's popularity, McCarthy was always the soulful one, the one hanging at the outer edge of the circle, the one Most Likely to Read Actual Books. In Brats, there's something both comical and endearingly earnest about the way McCarthy, in his attempt to parse the sociological implications of the term Brat Pack, seeks the counsel of wise man on the mount (and Tipping Point author) Malcolm Gladwell. Is there anything more Andrew McCarthy than that?\n\nBut McCarthy himself knows it's kind of funny, and that's what makes Brats so enjoyable. The movie's lo-fi vibe is part of its charm. It's structured something like this: We see McCarthy pacing the streets of his home city, New York, musing aloud on the way he and his old friends have come to be lumped together in this monogroup, rather than being considered artists in their own right. He bravely rings up his comrades, one by one, leaving friendly, hopeful messages. These are people he hasn't spoken with in several decades. When one or another of them gets back to him, he asks, jauntily, \"How's your life been these past 30 years?\"\n\nRead more: The Best Shows to Watch on Hulu\n\nThis is how McCarthy sets up on-camera conversations with Emilio Estevez and Rob Lowe, two of the key figures of Blum's original article; the third of Blum's subjects was Judd Nelson, who turns out to elude McCarthy, though he may, in absentia, end up getting the movie's best laugh. McCarthy sets up the movie by establishing the Brat Pack label as one that essentially tarnished these actors' reputations, in addition to just generally hurting their feelings. His journey takes him from New York to numerous locations that are most decidedly not New York: He travels to Estevez' spare, elegant house, where the two chat amicably from opposite sides of a spacious kitchen island. He drops in on the forever-and-always likable Jon Cryer, who also has a very nice kitchen. It takes a while for Lowe to return McCarthy's calls, but the two of them finally do meet up, in yet another nice kitchen.\n\nThe subtext is that these guys haven't done badly for themselves. But what McCarthy learns is that everyone who was either in the Brat Pack or Brat Pack-adjacent (that latter category would include actors like Timothy Hutton and Lea Thompson, also interviewed in the film) has a slightly different take on what the Brat Pack designation meant at the time, and each of them carries their current-day baggage differently. Estevez still feels stung; he was the chief subject of Blum's article, and he feels it ended up creating \"the perception that we were lightweights.\" Cryer notes what he saw as the article's main thrust: these young actors were riding too high and needed to be knocked down a peg. Lowe has taken it all in stride, reminding McCarthy, rightly, that the group was part of a great wave of movies geared to 18- to 20-year-olds, a marker of the era and one that changed the industry. His observations segue into a delightful story about the night, circa St. Elmo's Fire, he and McCarthy met Liza Minnelli at Spago's and later ended up at Sammy Davis Jr.'s house. At this point, even McCarthy has to admit: Being part of the Brat Pack was cool.\n\nRead more: The 100 Best Movies of the Past 10 Decades\n\nAlthough Molly Ringwald, arguably the grande dame of the Brat Packers, declined to talk to McCarthy -- she prefers not to look back -- it's the two other notable women of the group, Ally Sheedy and Demi Moore, who bring the healthiest perspective. Moore, speaking not from a well-appointed kitchen but from a massive, luxuriously landscaped yard, makes the point that Blum, in coining that unforgettable moniker, was just doing what any person doing creative work for hire has to do. \"It was about the person who wrote it trying to be clever and get their next job,\" she says. But McCarthy's meeting with Sheedy, who played the recessive Allison in The Breakfast Club, is the best of all. She has the most realistically comfy and cheerful digs of all, which appear to be somewhere in New York: its features include a squishy blue couch, a dresser whose blue paint is chipping off, and a half-dead poinsettia perched on a table. From that comfy couch, she speaks with unalloyed affection about The Breakfast Club and her association with this group of actors. \"I finally belong somewhere,\" is what she thought at the time, she says. \"And I have friends.\" If that seems like something The Breakfast Club's Allison would say, it's also the observation of a person who recognizes that a twist of fate that changed her life for the better.\n\nAfter watching Brats, the only reasonable thing to do is to go back to Blum's original article. How damning was it, really? For one thing, it focuses almost exclusively on Estevez, Nelson, and Lowe, depicting them as somewhat clueless rising stars who aren't taking their professions as seriously as their forebears Brando or Pacino did, but who instead like to get drunk and -- stop the presses -- pick up beautiful young women. It mentions none of the Brat Pack actresses at all, save a brief reference to Moore and what's referred to as her \"on-again, off-again\" relationship with Estevez. And McCarthy is barely mentioned, beyond a sideswipe: Blum notes that unlike most of the other Brats, he's based not in Los Angeles but in New York, which automatically makes him something of an outsider, and goes on to quote another Brat Packer, anonymously, as saying, \"He plays all his roles with too much of the same intensity. I don't think he'll make it.\" Ouch.\n\nYou can understand why the Brat Pack actors would have been upset by Blum's article. It's human nature to be sensitive about anything a journalist writes about you, and in the 1980s, before the advent of the Internet and the 24/7 news cycle, a seemingly derogative observation could stick for a long time. McCarthy is obviously still feeling the sting -- maybe even the sting of his barely being mentioned in Blum's article in the first place, though he doesn't articulate that. And so his odyssey eventually brings him right into the lair of the dragon. He meets with Blum himself.\n\nIf Blum was once a hotshot New York writer, he's now just a past-middle-aged guy in an office full of books, trying to make the journalism thing work in an era when no one seems to care about it. McCarthy doesn't say as much, but he seems to sense this. Their conversation is, at first, a little prickly on McCarthy's part and a little defensive on Blum's. Then they settle into a kind of accord. Blum was 29 when he wrote the Brat Pack article, still practically a kid himself. Now these two are just a couple of aging guys, reckoning with obsolescence, which eventually comes for us all. As McCarthy makes his goodbyes, he marvels that Blum is actually a really nice guy. What he's learned is that the nickname you hate -- and the one that sticks -- may also be the thing that keeps you alive forever in the public's imagination.

But when the buzz for St. Elmo's Fire caught, well, fire, that feature blew up into a cover story that infamously christened Estevez, Rob Lowe, Demi Moore et al \"Hollywood's Brat Pack.\"\n\nAndrew McCarthy, as director of BRATS, sets out to reconcile his own past struggle with the \"Brat Pack\" label by interviewing Estevez, Moore, Lowe, Ally Sheedy and other rising young stars of that time. (\"It's been a blessing more than a curse in my life,\" McCarthy shared at the TCA winter press tour, echoing his BRATS narrative. \"We were branded as 'partying, wanting to have a good time and get famous,'\" and as a result the young actors lost control of the narrative of their careers.)\n\nBut if you're looking for a trip down Brat Pack memory lane rife with fun anecdotes, once-hot goss and wall-to-wall clips from St. Elmo's Fire, The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink and the like, this is not that documentary.\n\nMcCarthy's individual reunions with his fellow Brat Packers -- some of whom he hadn't seen in 30 years -- are across-the-board genial and warm. His sit-down with Ally Sheedy was a highlight for me, and Rob Lowe is always gonna Rob Lowe.\n\nWhen McCarthy drops in on Demi Moore, it becomes crystal clear (if there was any doubt) that BRATS served as a bit of needed therapy for its maker. Moore's insightfulness fuels one of the film's more complex conversations, as she, from a place of love, nudges her onetime co-star to reconsider his toxic, decades-long relationship with the bratty label.\n\nIn addition to participating bona fide Brat Pack members -- McCarthy posits that the \"official\" line-up is him, Estevez, Lowe, Moore, Sheedy, Judd Nelson and Molly Ringwald -- Jon Cryer and Timothy Hutton also are paid a visit, while other talking heads include authors of related tomes and filmmaker John Hughes' go-to casting director. (Nelson decided not to participate in the docu, reportedly telling McCarthy, \"The Brat Pack didn't exist,\" and neither did Ringwald, but both appear in archival interviews.)\n\nThe breezy docu builds to McCarthy confronting New York Magazine vet Blum himself about siring the moniker that would prompt many Brat Pack members to instantly distance themselves from the others in subsequent films. Blum's recollection of coining the term is candid, non-apologetic, and in its own weird way helps bring McCarthy some closure.\n\nAs a filmmaker, McCarthy takes a few swings that don't land. BRATS has a clunky start due to his decision to chronicle his first exploratory cell phone calls to Estevez & Co., but since (recording consent laws!) we never hear the other end of those convos, the moments are inert. Similarly, he tries to film his arrival at each Brat Pack member's home, but the camerawork repeatedly fails to properly capture the long-awaited hellos and hugs.\n\nAs an interviewer, McCarthy left me wishing, hard, that he had asked his former co-stars one question: What film project did they think (or hope) broke them out of their Brat Pack mold? (Like, does Moore go with Ghosts? A Few Good Men? Striptease?) It could could have offered an insightful look into who each actor thought they could be, beyond the Brat Pack.\n\nWhere BRATS greatly succeeds is as a reminder of, hot damn!, what a moviegoing time we Gen Xers lived in back then! The Brat Pack and their peers were prolific during the 1980s, thanks in part to, yes, John Hughes, but also the trend of moviemaking at the time. A steady stream of low- and mid-budget films about high school and friends and college and relationships? With only the occasional blockbuster sci-fi film in sight? We lived, people.

As Emilio said [in the movie], we were kryptonite to each other in a certain way. I never thought of it the way he said it, but I thought that was quite accurate,\" said the actor, who went on to focus on directing and travel writing.\n\nMany of the key players agreed to rehash their shared past on camera for McCarthy -- but a few, including Judd Nelson, declined to participate.\n\n\"Any people that are or aren't in the film, I think that speaks to the proof of concept. People had different reactions to it, and they still do,\" the filmmaker explained. \"One of the first things I thought going into this was, 'I hope at least one person doesn't want to do this because it'll speak to how complicated it still is.\"\n\nHe further noted how his attitude towards the phrase has changed over the years and whether the pack plans to stay in touch after reconnecting.\n\nTheWrap: Was it cathartic to get back in touch with everybody else who was labeled a Brat Packer?\n\nAndrew McCarthy: I felt liberated, which is slightly different. But I achieved what I wanted to. I wasn't interested in a nostalgia romp, but I'm always very interested in how we reassess and make sense of our lives and how that changes over time. It was liberating in the sense that it brought the past to the present in a way that was rewarding.\n\nHow have your feelings about being part of the Brat Pack changed?\n\nAt the time, there was a seismic change happening in Hollywood. Young movies took over almost overnight, and we were at the forefront of that.\n\nSo there was a segment of the old guard that went, \"Who the hell are these punks?\"And then David Blum comes up with this really zippy phrase and they go, \"Oh, exactly. They're brats.\" It was always a very stigmatizing thing.\n\nWhereas the public was smarter than all of us and thought, \"No, we love these guys.\" That's what I didn't see for so long. They just wanted to grab this satchel of youth movies and run with it.\n\nWe were responding to what we felt was the industry reaction, whereas the public was responding to their own emotional needs, which are, \"I see these people in these movies and I identify with them.\" And we love that, that they saw themselves in us.\n\nYou meet with David Blum in the film and at one point he refers to the Brat Pack as \"collateral damage\" of his article.\n\nMy overriding feeling for David was affection, which was quite shocking. In the film, I say, \"You're someone who I felt did me such harm. And I look at you now with affection.\"\n\nDavid forgot about us very quickly, probably didn't think about us for a second when he was writing that. He just knew, \"I've got a great lede and this is a really good spin.\" And it was right at the time of that classic '80s snarky journalism, so was he thinking about the effect it would have?\n\nI think he says, \"No, it didn't actually occur to me.\" Once he had it, we stopped being people, we were just useful for the article. And that's what we can all be guilty of doing.\n\nJon Cryer was in \"Pretty in Pink,\" but he says he's not part of the Brat Pack.\n\nYou ask 10 people [and they will all say something different]. That's why we have that moment in the middle of the movie, like, \"Who's actually in the Brat Pack?\" And none of us know. It was always more of an idea.\n\nIt very much exists because we are still talking about it, but it wasn't a literal kind of thing. It existed as an idea and a concept, so I don't think it matters who's in it or not. I wasn't even in the article that David Blum wrote. I wasn't in the Brat Pack, according to him. [But people tell me], of course you're at the center of the Brat Pack at this point.\n\nThe truth is that I was an iconic member of the Brat Pack. The truth of 1985 is, no, I was excluded. So, which is right? They're both right.\n\nIt reminds me of Christopher Plummer, who hated \"The Sound of Music\" and the song \"Edelweiss\" for many years, and then he finally embraced it and was like, \"OK, it's part of who I am.\"\n\nAbsolutely. People come up to me on a daily basis and say, \"Oh, my God, those movies you made [mean so much to me].\" And I know they're really talking about themselves and their own youth and that wondrous moment the Brat Pack represents to a generation of people. If that's not a beautiful thing, I don't know what is.\n\nDo you think you will stay in touch with Demi and Rob and the other people you reconnected with?\n\nWell, I'm seeing Demi tonight, actually, and I was just texting with Rob yesterday. So we have so far. It's really nice.\n\nIs there a Brat Pack group text?\n\nNo, but we should get one going. That's a good idea. I don't actually know how to group chat. Somebody else would have to start it.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk subculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edelweiss_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edelweiss (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sound of Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Plummer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Plummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/thewrap.com/fa4b1cde258a50a304ba2a629ad55a4f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Andrew McCarthy's documentary is a personal story about his insecurities and interactions with the Brat Pack. Despite its focus on McCarthy, Brats offers a raw, entertaining, and reflective look at fame and nostalgia.\n\nWhen you think of classic coming-of-age movies, you'd probably first think about the movies of John Hughes. From The Breakfast Club to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Hughes forever reinvented the way that teens and young adults were portrayed in movies. Hughes was far more in touch with youth than any of the filmmakers who came before, and part of the magic of his movies was the actors he'd cast. From Molly Ringwald to Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall, the list goes on and on.\n\nMany of these actors were part of a group that the media dubbed as \"the Brat Pack.\" Taking its name from the \"Rat Pack\" from the 1950s and '60s, the word \"Brat\" isn't really something that builds confidence in oneself. It feels almost a bit demeaning, more like something an older person would call a group of spoiled teens who won't sit still and shut up.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, one of the many members of the so-called Brat Pack, hopes to set things straight with his new documentary, simply titled Brats. It's a documentary that feels less like a puff piece and more like therapy for its many subjects. It would have been fairly easy for a movie like this to feel more along the lines of a celebration, but Brats proves to be so much more than just that.\n\nBrats (2024) Documentary\n\nBrats offers an in-depth look at the lives of military children, capturing the complexities of growing up on the move. Through heartfelt interviews and vivid storytelling, the documentary highlights the resilience and adaptability required to navigate frequent relocations.\n\nRelease Date June 13, 2024 Director Andrew McCarthy Cast Lea Thompson , Molly Ringwald , Andrew McCarthy , Demi Moore , Ally Sheedy , Rob Lowe , Emilio Estevez , Jon Cryer Runtime 92 Minutes Main Genre Documentary Writers Andrew McCarthy Expand 'Brats' Doesn't Have the Ego Its Title Suggests and That's A Good Thing\n\nBrats begins with McCarthy talking about the big boom of young actors and actresses that occurred in Hollywood throughout the 80s. After years of never getting proper representation, McCarthy reminisced that it felt like nearly every weekend a new movie would open in theaters starring a youthful face. What started with the success of Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Risky Business, soon evolved into the success of John Hughes, as well as movies such as St. Elmo's Fire, Top Gun, Back to the Future, Dirty Dancing, Footloose, and The Karate Kid. It was like the output was never-ending.\n\nThe success story hits a road bump when McCarthy brings up a New York Magazine cover story dubbing the young actors dominating the movie world as the \"Brat Pack.\" What was initially planned to be a small piece on Emilio Estevez, soon became warped into a snarky, quasi-hit piece full of hurtful rhetoric. For the rest of the documentary, McCarthy reaches out and meets up with several of the members of the Brat Pack, such as Demi Moore and Rob Lowe, many of whom he hasn't seen in decades.\n\nBrats is as much a celebration as it is a meditation. Many times throughout the documentary, the actors share happy memories about their past, but there is just as much time spent, if not more time, where the actors talk about their reflections on their feelings. Moore in particular has a moment where she questions if it was reasonable for her feelings to be hurt by the New York Magazine article despite her success. For a movie full of big-name stars, not many of the folks being interviewed feel like they're full of themselves. There's not much ego on display.\n\n'Brats' Is Andrew McCarthy's Story Through and Through Close\n\nBrats is completely unafraid to go into the drama between the actors. It is made clear from the jump that the reason McCarthy chose to make this documentary wasn't just to take a walk down memory lane and pump audiences full of nostalgia, but because he still has insecurities of his own that have loomed over him ever since the original \"Brat Pack\" story was published. Each of the actors interviewed has their responses to the article, but their conversations aren't about their respective careers, they are more about McCarthy. However, McCarthy doesn't paint himself as some holier-than-thou saint. Instead, he presents himself as someone who is just looking for some old friends he can vent to, and in response has some sort of understanding with them.\n\nBrats isn't about the Brat Pack as a whole. After all, neither Molly Ringwald nor Judd Nelson make an appearance in the movie (although their presence looms large). There isn't a whole lot about Sheedy, Lowe, or Timothy Hutton's own stories about their lives after the eighties, and honestly, it may have been a tad more interesting if this were a docuseries rather than a 90-minute movie. Regardless, that wasn't what McCarthy set out to do anyway. This is a movie that he is using to tell his story. He lets his former costars share their thoughts, but that is primarily relegated to their feelings on the name \"Brat Pack.\"\n\nDespite the array of familiar faces, the main attraction of Brats is McCarthy's conversation with David Blum, the author of the article that birthed all of McCarthy's insecurities. Their conversation is as engrossing as it is uncomfortable. There is clearly a lot there that McCarthy and Blum want to say to one another, and it is fascinating to watch both of the men attempt to walk around their true feelings.\n\nWhile Brats may not be the complete history of the Brat Pack that many viewers may have hoped for, McCarthy's documentary is still a fascinating look into the other side of fame. It isn't scandalous nor is it overly schmaltzy. It's raw and unfiltered but entertaining nonetheless. This isn't an overly cynical 90 minutes either. McCarthy still includes enough allusions to The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink through needle drops and camera shots that are enough to satisfy one's thirst for nostalgia. Brats serves as not only an enjoyable walk down memory lane but also something deeper and more self-reflective.\n\nREVIEW Brats (2024)\n\n'Brats' may not be as expansive as its title suggests, but it is still an entertaining and unfiltered look into Andrew McCarthy's reaction to stardom.\n\n710\n\nProsAndrew McCarthy is willing to show himself and his former co-stars in a less glamorous light than you'd expect.McCarthy finds ways to make himself and his former co-stars feel relatable.McCarthy's interview with David Blum is a major highlight and is uncomfortable as it is engaging.

Some of the members were young enough to still be in school, while others were old enough to party.\n\nRelated: Rob Lowe: Brat Pack to Backpacks\n\nBecoming associated with the Brat Pack might seem like great advertising to launch the group's careers.\n\nBut it did the opposite for several of the pack -- especially the females.\n\nMolly Ringwald appeared as the lead female in several '80s films that fans still consider classics, including Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club, and For Keeps.\n\nThese John Hughes films featured other Pack members, such as Anthony Michael Hall, Andrew McCarthy, Judd Nelson, and fellow Bratette Ally Sheedy.\n\nRingwald was only 16 when her name landed among the party-going Brats, and the association did not help her career.\n\nShe and Anthony Michael Hall were the two youngest actors in the group.\n\nThey did not party like the older members, so she struggled with being connected to a group known for its risque behaviors.\n\nGiven that she and Anthony Michael Hall were of similar age and did several movies together, it's no surprise that they became an '80s power couple for a short time.\n\nRelated: Top TV Couples from the 1980s\n\nShe recently appeared on a podcast, WTF with Marc Maron, ahead of Andrew McCarthy's Brats documentary's release.\n\nShe revealed that, like many others, she was also taken advantage of as a young actor.\n\nAfter getting typecast as the teen heartthrob girl next door, Molly struggled to find jobs where she would appear as anything else.\n\nRingwald received so much attention as America's sweetheart that she left the country to move to France after her last film, For Keeps, in 1988.\n\nWhile away, she had a successful career as a French jazz singer, which gave her a start as a French literature translator and novelist.\n\nWe didn't see her back on screen until 1996, when she did a brief stint in a TV series, Townies.\n\nShe returned big time when she scored a recurring role in The Secret Life of an American Teenager from 2008 to 2013.\n\nMore recently, she had a long-term role on Riverdale, the modern remake of the classic comic book from 2017 to 2023, and Feud: Capote vs The Swans in 2024.\n\nRelated: Does the Death of Syndicated Reruns Mean the End of Catchphrases and Cult Shows?\n\nAlly is best known for her role as the oddball, all-in-black weirdo in Breakfast Club, who made us non-popular people feel less strange.\n\nShe also starred in another Brat Pack film, St. Elmo's Fire, which landed her as the second female on the pack list.\n\nMuch like Ringwald, Sheedy did not like having a negative association with a group that had a reputation -- unjustly -- as entitled and wild.\n\nBecause she ended up connected with the Brats, she struggled with her acting career after the Brat Pack movies.\n\nShe had a few roles in movies by female filmmakers over the years, preferring to work with women filmmakers.\n\nBut she turned down bigger roles like Short Circuit 2 because they didn't want to pay her a higher salary.\n\nAs her fame started to fade, Hollywood tried getting Sheedy to change so she could compete with other leading actresses.\n\nThroughout her early career, she dealt with addiction, depression, and an eating disorder. She published a poetry book in 1991 recounting her struggles and recovery.\n\nFellow Bratlette Demi Moore helped Sheedy get into rehab.\n\nRelated: The Brat Pack: Dissension in the Ranks\n\nAfter struggling to find acting jobs, she landed her dream role with High Art in 1998, which earned her an Independent Spirit Award.\n\nShe's done multiple independent films over the years before declaring that she was done acting in 2018.\n\nDemi Moore might have been most successful after getting linked with the Brats. Her association was dual entry.\n\nShe started in several roles before appearing in the 1985 Brat Pack film St. Elmo's Fire. Before that, she was a regular on General Hospital for two years.\n\nDemi's engagement to head Brat, Emilio Estevez is the second reason for her Brat pack association.\n\nThey never married.\n\nBut she did marry Freddy Moore, Bruce Willis, and Ashton Kutcher.\n\nRelated: Quit Your Day Job: What 11 Stars Did Before Making It Big\n\nDemi also struggled with addiction, once getting kicked off the set of St. Elmo's for being high. Through tough love, Moore was able to recover and continue acting.\n\nHer career took off, leading her to greatness four decades strong and still going.\n\nAlong with appearing in the Brats documentary, Demi will be starring with fellow Bratlette Molly Ringwald in Feud.\n\nAs with the other Brats, Demi didn't approve of the name or its implications.\n\nIn a recent interview with Good Morning America, she stated that the nickname insulted them as professionals, as it had nothing to do with their careers.\n\nIt was just a good headline.\n\nWhile the fan-based Brat Pack only had three females, a few other actresses could have rightfully been included based on the premise of being in a Brat Pack movie.\n\nMare Winningham appeared in St. Elmo's Fire with Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, and Andrew McCarthy.\n\nShe's been in over 100 roles, starting her career a good decade sooner than the rest of the Brat Pack. Despite being in St. Elmo's, she stayed as a brat adjacent actor.\n\nRelated: The Age of Nostalgia: Why Young Audiences Are Seeking Out Old TV\n\nAndie MacDowell was also in St. Elmo's Fire. She felt awkward during filming because she was an outsider among an ensemble of actors who had worked together before.\n\nShe was also doing romantic scenes with Estevez while he was engaged to Demi, who was on site while they were filming.\n\nDespite those connections, MacDowell never made it to Brat Pack status. But she's been in many things, with her trademark curls and dimples.\n\nLea Thompson is a third Brat adjacent who never ascended to belonging to the pack. She certainly saw similar success from her work on the series Some Kind of Wonderful.\n\nShe was in several prominent '80s movies, like the Back to the Future franchise and Red Dawn -- the original, not the remake with Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck.\n\nIf you were to ask fans what they thought of the brat pack, you'd likely hear a lot of love, respect, and appreciation for their part in changing movies for young people.\n\nBut if you asked any of the group -- especially the ladies -- it was a burden.\n\nWe get it. It must suck to be labeled, judged, and treated a certain way without cause or reason.\n\nMost of us still can't figure out how the three women -- Demi, Molly, and Ally -- became part of a group that never actually existed.\n\nAll we can say is that we're glad they did! This is one '80s lady who will never forget the impact that group of unassociated celebs had on my childhood and subsequent adulthood.\n\nRelated: Why Has Gen Z Produced So Few Prominent TV Stars?\n\nHow about you? What is your favorite Brat Pack movie featuring one of our three stunning lady loves?\n\nDo you think it's fair that they ended up labeled as part of a group of actors that originally stood for spoilt, self-indulgent good-timers?\n\nDrop your thoughts in the comments and pass this piece on to your Brat Pack and '80s-loving friends!", "source": {"uri": "tvfanatic.com", "dataType": "news",

Associated Press\n\nHe's 61 now, well-off and trim. He has many accomplishments as an actor but there's this one thing he finds hard to shake: Back in 1985, he got called something. During the Reagan administration, rising star Andrew McCarthy was lumped into an amorphous group of young actors who were changing Hollywood. They were called the \"Brat Pack.\" Now, it's never nice to be called a \"brat\" or to lose your individuality to a pack, but McCarthy and the members of this collective -- Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe and maybe Anthony Michael Hall -- seemed to implode. \"That changed my life,\" says McCarthy, who starred in \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" After being branded, the so-called bratty actors scattered, not wanting to work together again. The stigma, McCarthy says, was \"defining.\" He has PTSD, he suggests.\n\nNow almost 40 years later, McCarthy hit the road to star in and direct his new Hulu documentary, \"Brats,\" trying to get a handle on the label and how some of the pack handled it.\n\nFirst stop is a wary Estevez, who acknowledges that the Brat Pack term had some early benefits but was ultimately \"more damage than good.\" \"It created the perception that we were lightweights,\" he adds.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nGriffin Dunne chronicles the story of his family in the new memoir\n\nRoger Daltrey talks about new tour and future of The Who\n\nJennifer Aniston gets emotional as she reminisces 30 years of 'Friends'\n\nThen there are visits to Sheedy, Moore, Lowe, Jon Cryer, Tim Hutton and Lea Thompson -- all who commiserate with McCarthy. (Ringwald and Nelson are notable absences, perhaps still nursing wounds.) These visits have the feeling of therapy sessions. \"Marty Scorsese, Steven Spielberg is not going to call up somebody who's in the Brat Pack,\" McCarthy tells Estevez, who admits to pulling out of a movie at the prospect of teaming up with McCarthy.\n\n(Not to be rude, but the Brat Pack-adjacent Tom Cruise did a movie with Scorsese, \"The Color of Money,\" Moore became the hottest thing in Hollywood in the 90s and Robert Downey Jr., also Pack-adjacent, just took home an Oscar.)\n\nAs he pays one former colleague after another a visit at their well-appointed homes, the heat of injustice has dissipated. Moore's estate with its tasteful wood panels, shaded pool, massive glass walls and Japanese-inspired minimalism doesn't exactly scream, \"That label from 1985 really destroyed my life.\"\n\nThe doc is scored well, with songs by The Cure, Lou Reed and Steve Winwood, \"Forever Young\" by Alphaville and a haunting \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" cover by Zoe Fox and the Rocket Clocks.\n\nBut McCarthy's visual style is too fragmented, happy to capture his scrambling camera and sound operators in the frame and changing up his shots from guerilla-style jerky iPhone images to tasteful, polished portraits. His use of old clips is excellent, incorporating not just scenes from movies but TV interview outtakes, too.\n\nA more interesting thing happens in McCarthy's road movie by the halfway mark - it becomes a sort of celebration of Brat Pack movies. Cultural observer Malcolm Gladwell talks about the generational transition in Hollywood, while Susannah Gora, who wrote \"You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried\" about the Brat Pack's impact, notes that teens in the Midwest were singing British New Wave synth-pop tunes thanks to McCarthy.\n\nPop culture critic Ira Madison III zeroes in on the lack of diversity in Brat Pack movies, \"Less Than Zero\" writer Bret Easton Ellis notes the influence the movies had on his work, and screenwriter Michael Oates Palmer comments that Brat Pack movies were the first to take \"young people's lives seriously.\"\n\nThese are the building blocks of a better movie -- Gladwell cutely mentions that he used parts of Cryer's character Duckie from \"Pretty in Pink\" as his identity in high school -- but McCarthy isn't willing to stray. He comes across as a very thoughtful guy, able to quote Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill, reserved, shy and wry, so often deep in his feelings. But this bratty label he cannot shake. He also wrote about it in \"Brat: An '80s Story.\" It is his Moby Dick.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And on how the story is told.\n\nViewers might see him in footage from iconic 1980s films. But the actor himself did not participate in the ABC News project, which premiered on Hulu on Thursday, June 13.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, like Nelson, was a clear member of the Brat Pack. And Brats is McCarthy's project.\n\nBut Judd Nelson told Us Weekly that he won't be part of the Brat Pack movie, as he \"politely declined\" the invitation.\n\n\"It seems strange to have that subject matter be something for edited entertainment,\" Judd Nelson commented back in March.\n\n\"Also, like, [McCarthy's] a nice guy,\" he he emphasized. \"But I hadn't seen him in 35 years.\"\n\nNelson continued at the time: \"And it's like, I'm not going to [be] like, 'Hey!' No, dude.\"\n\nTo be clear, the \"Brat Pack\" was not an official label. In 1985, New York magazine branded the cast of The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire under that seemingly derogatory name.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, Judd Nelson, Demi Moore, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Mare Winningham, Molly Ringwold, Jon Cryer, and Ally Sheedy were all clear-cut members of the group. Even if they did not wish to be.\n\nHowever, other -- sometimes more famous -- young 1980s actors like Timothy Hutton, Tom Cruise, Nicholas Cage, and Sean Penn have sometimes become associated with the label.\n\nThe group's name is, of course, a play on Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack. In the mid-1980s, the Rat Pack was not as distant of a memory as it is today.\n\nOf that group, McCarthy, Lowe, Moore, Cryer, Sheedy, and Estevez (and more) signed up to participate in Brats.\n\nFor some, it's an amazing opportunity to dive into their early years of acting. For others, it's a chance to remind everyone that they're still around. Some success stories last longer than others.\n\n\"I don't even know who's in the Brat Pack,\" Nelson admitted. \"It's like, why kind of rebirth something that wasn't necessarily fun? How can we be experts on something that didn't really exist?\"\n\n\"What was so strange is I lived in New York, then I did a movie with people out here [in LA]. So it's like, then I'm hanging out with them ... then when the movie's over, I go back to New York,\" he explained. \"I'm not going to be like, 'Hey, let's go to Hard Rock Cafe.' It's weird.\"\n\nIn addition to not wanting to exaggerate decades-old friendships, Nelson also did not appreciate the \"brat\" label. \"They kind of portrayed my generation of actors as being entitled and irresponsible and unprofessional,\" he recalled. \"Whereas my experience was on time. \"Everyone knew their lines. It's so weird.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_delott@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Simon Delott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Winningham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mare Winningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Hutton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Hutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Cafe", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Cafe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Penn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Penn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Sinatra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/06/0612_juddnelson_header.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 619, "textEnd": 626}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

They were, in his view, \"a roving band of famous young stars on the prowl for parties, women, and a good time,\" a group that Blum cleverly named to evoke the Rat Pack of 20 years prior.\n\nBut once that phrase entered the lexicon, its meaning morphed into something broader and more culturally significant than Blum could have anticipated. The Brat Pack became shorthand for the key actors who stood at the epicenter of the 1980s' teen-movie explosion. There was no official list of its members; who was in and who wasn't remained a matter of debate, although Blum offers his own (extremely misguided in retrospect) assessment in his piece. But most Gen-Xers who grew up during that period shared a common understanding of who qualified and who did not.\n\nThe Brat Pack included some mix of the stars of John Hughes movies, the postgrad pals of St. Elmo's Fire, and the faces that decorated the covers of Beats both Tiger and Teen. Everyone in it was a distinctive actor, but collectively, their filmographies (and, occasionally, personal lives) overlapped like the paths of students who keep crossing each other on campus. We're talking Emilio Estevez and Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, and Andrew McCarthy. You know: the Brat Pack.\n\nBut as more time passes, the definition of the Brat Pack continues to evolve. Even though Blum's article was published in June of 1985, the term it invented has become synonymous with the 1980s as a whole. For too long, the Brat Pack -- the subject of the new documentary Brats, a revisitation of the group's significance directed by one of its members, McCarthy -- has been defined by people who weren't in it and didn't grow up on the coming-of-age films its actors helped popularize. Like the kids in The Breakfast Club, its members were initially categorized (cough by baby-boomers cough) \"in the simplest terms, and the most convenient definitions,\" with little nuance or respect for what each actor had to offer.\n\nIt's time to redefine the Brat Pack in light of what it now signifies -- to create a Revised Brat Pack, if you will -- using a carefully considered list of criteria and an openness to the entirety of the decade and its impact on youth culture. Yes, this group skews male and is white as hell. Sadly, that was how mainstream Hollywood was back then.\n\nThe Revised Brat Pack consists of three tiers -- the Brat Pack Inner Circle, the Brat Pack Adjacent, and the Next-Gen Brat Pack -- and includes actors who meet some or all of the following criteria.\n\n1. They played a teenager or very young adult in multiple popular films in the 1980s aimed at young audiences and, for a period, were defined by that. Every word in this requirement should be taken very literally, which is why some actors don't quite fit under the Brat Pack umbrella. Timothy Hutton, identified as a member in Blum's piece, is not really in the Brat Pack because, with the exception of Taps, his notable early works were not teen movies. This is also true of Forest Whitaker, who played a small role in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, arguably the first '80s high-school movie of consequence, but pivoted to more adult roles too quickly to feel \"Brat Pack-y.\" The same can be said of Matthew Broderick, who, with the exception of WarGames and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, did not appear in many explicitly teen-oriented movies. (Before you ask: Tom Cruise is in his own category and that is not open to debate, sorry.)\n\n2. They became famous in movies, not on TV first. The Brat Pack was born when the biggest, most revered stars were products of the movie business. So while Michael J. Fox may have starred in Back to the Future and Teen Wolf, he was known first for his breakout role on Family Ties, which knocks him out of contention. One could argue that Molly Ringwald, the queen of '80s youth cinema, is also disqualified by this since she technically appeared in the first two seasons of The Facts of Life. But it was Sixteen Candles and the John Hughes oeuvre that truly catapulted her to fame, so she's totally in the group, whether she wants to be or not. (Both she and Judd Nelson opted not to participate in McCarthy's documentary.)\n\n3. They were in The Outsiders, The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, or more than one of these films. These three ensemble movies came along in the middle of the decade and established the appeal of the teen movie. 1983's The Outsiders turned every guy in its cast into instant heartthrobs, while the overlapping ensembles in The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire in 1985 reinforced the idea that the hot young actors of the moment were members of the same clique. Blum name-checks all three of them in his original piece, and on this point he was correct.\n\n4. They were in at least one John Hughes teen movie. Because Blum's article was published before Weird Science, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Some Kind of Wonderful were released, it de-emphasized the importance of the Hughes canon, which is synonymous with what the Brat Pack came to represent. And that is wrong.\n\n5. They co-starred in a project with at least one of the actors in the Brat Pack Inner Circle or Brat Pack Adjacent category. There has to be some IMDb overlap with the first two tiers of Brat Packers to be included.\n\nThe OGs of '80s teen cinema.\n\nShe was John Hughes's muse, an actress who could believably play the popular snob (Claire in The Breakfast Club) and the outsider too hip for the normies (Andie in Pretty in Pink). To practically every preteen and teenage girl in the '80s, she felt like both a relatable best friend and the cool girl you desperately wanted to be.\n\nCriteria met: All five.\n\nThe \"nucleus\" of the original article, as McCarthy puts it in Brats, he is the only actor who pulled off the Brat Pack hat trick by appearing in all three of the films mentioned in the third criterion for inclusion: The Outsiders, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire.\n\nCriteria met: All five.\n\nIt's odd that Hall's name is not mentioned in Blum's article -- perhaps because he was still an actual teenager at the time? -- or in McCarthy's documentary, because he is core to the Brat Pack as the only person other than Ringwald to star in three of the Hughes teen movies (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Weird Science). He and Ringwald also briefly dated in the '80s.\n\nCriteria met: All five.\n\nShe played Matthew Broderick's girlfriend in WarGames, Rob Lowe's love interest in Oxford Blues, and Judd Nelson's conflicted partner seeking independence in St. Elmo's Fire. But it was her role in The Breakfast Club as Allison Reynolds, the introverted goth weirdo who decorates her artwork with her own dandruff, that made her a forever Gen-X icon.\n\nCriteria met: All five.\n\nWhile Nelson meets all the Brat Pack requirements, it's true that he did not appear in as many popular teen movies as his colleagues. Counterpoint: He played John Bender in The Breakfast Club, a role that freeze-framed him with his fist raised in the air, creating one of the most recognizable symbols of '80s teen cinema.\n\nCriteria met: All five.\n\nSomehow, he was never cast in a John Hughes movie, but Lowe racked up more than enough coming-of-age credits in the 1980s, including The Outsiders, Class, Oxford Blues, and St. Elmo's Fire, to qualify for Brat Pack success. In his piece, Blum described him as the Brat Pack's \"Most Beautiful Face,\" and that face was on the cover of every teen magazine, over and over again.\n\nCriteria met: 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nLike Nelson, she doesn't have as many blatantly teen-friendly '80s credits as her cohorts. She started out playing women in their early 20s, but in movies that were aimed at teens (No Small Affair, St. Elmo's Fire, One Crazy Summer). But largely because of her role in St. Elmo's -- and, perhaps, the fact that she and Estevez were once engaged -- she'll always be an OG Brat Packer.\n\nCriteria met: 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nThe sensitive soul among the Brat Pack men, he meets all the criteria. He gave Molly Ringwald the perfect first kiss in Pretty in Pink, and he made a documentary about the Brat Pack. While he once obviously yearned to shake his association with all these '80s teen movies, he seems to have finally embraced it.\n\nCriteria met: All five.\n\nThey traveled in the same cinematic terrain as the members of the Inner Circle but weren't quite one of them.\n\nDillon broke out as a teen star in 1980's My Bodyguard well before the Brat Pack existed. That always made him feel separate from it, as did his status as the face of another '80s teen-movie subgenre: the S.E. Hinton adaptation. He starred in three of those: Tex, The Outsiders, and Rumble Fish.\n\nCriteria met: 1, 2, and 5.\n\nBecause he was a Chicago guy and, at first, more of a supporting player, maybe Cusack didn't make it onto Blum's radar. But this guy was all over the teen-movie spectrum in the '80s and one of its most beloved representatives. Class, Sixteen Candles, The Sure Thing, Better Off Dead (!), The Journey of Natty Gann, and Say Anything as Lloyd Dobler, the high-school graduate who doesn't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career? People, bow down.\n\nCriteria met: 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nI was on the fence about including Sheen because, you know: #winning. But it's hard to act as though he weren't a notable part of the '80s teen-movie scene -- he was in Red Dawn and the sweet and underrated Lucas (best slow clap in an '80s teen movie!), and, most memorably, he played a burnout in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. He's also connected to the Inner Circle by birth, as Estevez's brother.\n\nWhen McCarthy interviews Thompson in Brats, she describes herself as \"Brat Pack adjacent,\" which is why this category is called that. And she's right. She wasn't quite in the Brat Pack, but her career ran right alongside it. She played Tom Cruise's girlfriend in All the Right Moves, went to Space Camp with a very young Joaquin Phoenix (then known as Leaf), hit on her own son (in her defense, she didn't know he was her son) in Back to the Future, and eventually made her way into a John Hughes movie thanks to Some Kind of Wonderful.\n\nCriteria met: 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nShe played a teen in three of the most memorable youth movies of the era: Red Dawn, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Dirty Dancing. The latter two were among the top-grossing teen movies of the decade. So we're not putting her in a corner, but we are putting her in the Brat Pack Adjacent tier.\n\nThese were the teen stars who emerged in the latter half of the decade and therefore got completely ignored by the New York Magazine article. They also more clearly represent the Gen-X sensibility: These actors were a little edgy, a tad outside the mainstream, and cool as hell.\n\nWhile we think of Reeves these days as an action star and a seemingly very nice guy who actually dates women his own age, he got his start mostly by playing sweet stoner types in films like the influential indie River's Edge, Parenthood, and Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, in which he portrayed San Dimas High School's own Theodore \"Ted\" Logan. (He also co-starred with Lowe in Youngblood and would later work with Ryder on more than one occasion.)\n\nCriteria met: 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nGreetings and salutations to the bad boy of late-'80s teen cinema, who made his mark in The Legend of Billie Jean and Gleaming the Cube, and, most importantly, as J.D., the James Dean of the darkly comedic classic Heathers, in which he seduces Ryder. (Pump Up the Volume and Young Guns II, in which Slater acts opposite Estevez, came out just after the '80s ended, in 1990.)\n\nCriteria met: 1, 2, and 5.\n\nIf Phoenix hadn't died of an overdose so tragically in 1993, it's possible he would have become the most accomplished actor on this list. It was clear that he was gifted from the very beginning, whether he was starring in coming-of-age fare -- Explorers, Stand by Me, A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon -- or major films like The Mosquito Coast or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. In addition to appearing in Stand by Me, as Cusack did, he co-starred in multiple films with Reeves.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jen_chaney@vulture.com", "name": "Jen Chaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teen film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(filmmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Hughes (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Science_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weird Science (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby boomers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferris Bueller (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Youth culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Hutton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Hutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Broderick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Broderick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming of age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IMDb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxford Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelson (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Facts_of_Life_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Facts of Life (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breakthrough role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forest Whitaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael J.

Fox and Val Kilmer documentaries, but \"Brats\" turns Andrew McCarthy's near-40-year-old beef about \"the Brat Pack\" label into an exercise in self-indulgence, too heavily skewed toward his point of view. While it's fun seeing \"The Breakfast Club\" as they near \"The Early-Bird Dinner Club\" years, this is one of those projects that would have benefited from a more journalistic tone.\n\nThe origin of the term dates back to a New York magazine story with the headline \"Hollywood's Brat Pack,\" which lumped together stars of movies like \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"Pretty in Pink,\" playing off the \"Rat Pack\" nickname that defined Frank Sinatra and his celebrity pals.\n\nMcCarthy and his contemporaries, however, found the designation dismissive and insulting, underscored by rapid-fire video clips with news/\"Entertainment Tonight\" types throwing it around in the '80s, and the young actors fidgeting through questions about it from the likes of Phil Donahue, Charlie Rose and Merv Griffin.\n\nNow in their early 60s, McCarthy - having written a memoir, \"Brat: An '80s Story,\" about his experiences - transforms that into this ABC News documentary for Hulu, which is presented almost entirely looking over his shoulder. That includes an extended sequence of him on the phone trying to set up interviews with his contemporaries, which is every bit as scintillating as that sounds.\n\nA hit-miss collection of conversations follows, with some of the key players (Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson notable among them) taking a pass, while Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Lea Thompson, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer and Rob Lowe - some of whom question their own \"Brat Pack\" credentials - walk down memory lane, generally exhibiting less animus toward being \"branded\" that way than McCarthy appears to harbor.\n\nRob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy during the \"Brat Pack\" era, as seen in \"Brats.\"\n\nABC News Studios\n\nAs it happens, the most interesting exchanges come from third-party voices, such as authors Malcolm Gladwell and Bret Easton Ellis, which underscores that a sense of distance and perspective can be helpful in these situations, from noting how director John Hughes avoided issues of race to the significance of music in films of that era.\n\nAs the actors acknowledge, they benefited from a shift that saw Hollywood chasing their demographic, an emphasis on catering to youth that permeated TV as well as movies and persists to this day. Gladwell makes the astute case that such productions will never be quite the same as they were back then thanks to fragmentation brought about by streaming and an abundance of choices.\n\n\"We've gone from a relatively unified youth culture ... to everything's all over the place,\" Gladwell observes. \"There's no common denominator.\"\n\nMostly, \"Brats\" plays like a latter-day therapy session like the one the kids underwent in \"The Breakfast Club,\" only with the benefit of four decades of hindsight. It certainly feels like McCarthy seeks to build toward that by meeting with the writer of the article who coined \"Brat Pack,\" David Blum, who understands how the young actors might have seen it as dismissive or \"unjust,\" as Moore puts it, but doesn't apologize for something that amounted to a playful turn of phrase half a lifetime ago.\n\nAs noted, \"Brats\" joins a long list of confessional and/or nostalgic documentaries, with Soleil Moon Frye's \"Kid 90\" and Alex Winter's \"Showbiz Kids\" among other examples.\n\n\"We fit a niche that needed to be filled in pop culture at that moment,\" McCarthy says of himself and his peers back in their heyday.\n\nDon't look now, but \"Brats\" does much the same thing, filling a slightly different niche as streaming services look for ways to garner attention and distinguish themselves from the Subscription Pack.\n\n\"Brats\" premieres June 13 on Hulu.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_lowry@cnn.com", "name": "Brian Lowry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael J.

We were who you wanted to hang with, who you emulated, or envied, who you wanted to party with, but for those of experiencing the Brat Pack from the inside, it was something very different.\"\n\nWith McCarthy the director relying a bit too heavily on a raw, indie-style approach, McCarthy the intrepid narrator attempts to track down and set up interviews with his former colleagues, and it's a surprise to learn he hasn't talked to most of them in decades -- not because of any feuds, but because after the article came out, they all took great pains to distance themselves, personally and professionally, so as not to participate as a punchline in their own lives.\n\nCatching up with Emilio Estevez in Estevez' Malibu home, McCarthy notes they haven't seen each other since the premiere night of \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" while Estevez recalls how the two were supposed to do a film called \"Young Man With Unlimited Capital,\" but it didn't happen after the article came out. Visiting Ally Sheedy, McCarthy says, \"I had a crush on you,\" to which Sheedy responds, \"You did not, Andrew.\" McCarthy also talks to \"Brat Pack Adjacent\" actors Jon Cryer and Lea Thompson, as well as cultural commentator Malcolm Gladwell, who tries to help McCarthy comes to grips with his legacy.\n\nThe journey continues, with stops at the respective homes of Rob Lowe and Timothy Hutton and Demi Moore. (All of these actors have clearly done quite well for themselves, whether they're living in oceanside palaces or rustic country homes.) It becomes clear that while many of them share McCarthy's view that the article was unfair, none has been affected by it nearly as much as McCarthy. Moore says that while she felt the piece was unjust, \"Why did we take it as an offense? Because we were young...\" Lowe makes the case that those early 1980s movies paved the way for youth-oriented fare such as \"Glee\" and even \"Friends.\" We're also reminded of how so many of those films have become beloved, generational touchstones.\n\nWe keep wondering if McCarthy will have a face-to-face with Blum, and sure enough, Blum welcomes McCarthy to his apartment. (They've never met before.) It's a cordial, respectful exchange, even ending with a hug, though we can sense the underlying tension, with McCarthy trying to get Blum to acknowledge the harm the article caused, and Blum saying that yes, in retrospect it seems scathing, but, \"I feel more redeemed than ever. ... You were all adults ... it wasn't meant to destroy or hurt anyone.\"\n\nAs for disappointments ... Judd Nelson wasn't available for the documentary, while Molly Ringwald declined to participate.

The article's author, David Blum, name-checked a select few - Estevez, Tom Cruise, Judd Nelson, Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon - but the term quickly came to encompass others for a variety of reasons.\n\nOne of those was Andrew McCarthy, who became a member by virtue of starring in the 1985 ensemble film St. Elmo's Fire. He and the others came to resent the label, thinking it to be reductive and inaccurate, despite the fact that many of them starred in multiple movies together. Now, almost 40 years later, McCarthy is attempting to sort through those complicated feelings by directing the new Hulu documentary, Brats.\n\nMcCarthy makes himself the face of the film, conducting self-interviews of sorts while walking or driving. He also takes it upon himself to reach out to anyone who was labeled or associated with the Brat Pack to see if they would be willing to talk about that time of their life. This leads to interviews with a variety of actors, including Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer, Lea Thompson, Hutton, Demi Moore, and Rob Lowe.\n\nWhat comes out of these conversations is how baffling each of them found the frenzy surrounding the term, especially since most of them didn't hang out with each other away from movie sets. And while McCarthy and others say that the label tapped into the fears/doubts the actors had about themselves, others like Cryer and Thompson lament that they weren't \"officially\" members.\n\nThe interviews also reveal that no one can agree on who exactly was part of the group. Those who starred in St. Elmo's Fire - McCarthy, Lowe, Moore, Nelson, Estevez, and Sheedy - seem to be at the top of the heap, but whither their co-star Mare Winningham? Three of those six actors also starred in 1985's The Breakfast Club, but only one of that film's other two stars - Molly Ringwald - is mentioned in the film, with the name Anthony Michael Hall never even coming up.\n\nMcCarthy illustrates the media obsession with the group by showing a variety of old interviews with himself and other stars. He also conducts interviews with industry insiders like director Howard Deutch and producer Lauren Shuler Donner, pop culture critic Ira Madison III, novelist Bret Easton Ellis, and others to get the perspective of people not in the group. He even tracks down Blum, resulting in an illuminating talk that ends with the two expressing feelings of a kinship with each other.\n\nWhat becomes evident is that the name \"Brat Pack\" represented a specific moment in time, and then somehow morphed to define an entire generation of actors. As McCarthy says in the film, \"That it didn't really exist doesn't even matter.\" That's because many of them felt that the name changed how they were perceived in the industry, and therefore limited the potential of many of their careers.\n\nDespite the somewhat downbeat nature of their conversations, fans of the actors will likely get a jolt of enjoyment at seeing them reconnect after all these years. And McCarthy makes liberal use of both scenes from films of the era and the iconic songs that came from them, leaning heavily into the nostalgia they elicit. The very last scene hits the perfect note for both, connecting the documentary to a film many know and love.\n\nWhile how the label of \"Brat Pack\" affected a small number of actors is not the most important topic in the world, the enduring movies they made in a short period of time represent an important part of movie history. If nothing else, Brats further demonstrates how actors share the same doubts, fears, and insecurities about themselves as everyday people. The only difference is the light shined upon them can exacerbate those feelings immeasurably.", "source": {"uri": "dallas.culturemap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CultureMap Dallas"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Hutton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Hutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lea_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lea Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Winningham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mare Winningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Deutch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard Deutch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Shuler_Donner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lauren Shuler Donner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Easton_Ellis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bret Easton Ellis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dallas.culturemap.com/media-library/rob-lowe-and-andrew-mccarthy-in-brats.jpg?id=52451255&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C15%2C0%2C23", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

And it changed our lives, really.\"\n\nMcCarthy added that though he once \"hated\" the term, his feelings have \"changed pretty much 180 degrees,\" which became the motivation for the documentary.\n\n\"I hated it so much when I was a kid, and now I've grown to realize it's probably the greatest blessing of my professional life,\" he said. \"And so, I thought I'd go see what everybody else thought about it, because I haven't talked to most of those guys in 30 years.\"\n\nNot everyone participated in the documentary. The most notable absences are Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson, who both starred in \"The Breakfast Club\" alongside Estevez, Hall and Sheedy. Nelson, Estevez and Sheedy also joined the cast of \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" the second movie that defined the \"Brat Pack\" era.\n\nMcCarthy and Tapper touched on the \"real seismic cultural shift\" the two films and their casts caused at the time. \"I mean, before that, movies were adult entertainment -- you know, 'The French Connection,' 'The Godfather' ... and then suddenly Hollywood discovered that kids go to the movies five, six, seven times, grown-ups go once,\" McCarthy said.\n\nThe solution? Studios thought, \"Let's make movies for kids.\"\n\nThe pre-internet, pre-social media era meant \"it was such a unified youth culture then, because now everything is so fractured.\"\n\n\"But back then,\" McCarthy continued, \"everybody was looking in the same direction, and the direction they ended up looking was our direction.\"\n\nIt is unclear exactly why Ringwald and Nelson didn't participate in the film. In a February interview with NPR's \"Fresh Air,\" Ringwald said she should have worked with director John Hughes on a fourth movie after the success of their first three (\"Sixteen Candles\" in 1984, \"The Breakfast Club\" in 1985 and \"Pretty in Pink\" in 1986), but at the time she hoped to diversify her acting chops.\n\nWhen she was asked by Hughes to star in 1987's \"Some Kind of Wonderful,\" Ringwald said no. \"He asked me to do it, but I didn't.

There are moments of embarrassment, humility and catharsis, with apologies offered and new perspectives gained.\n\nThe \"Brat Pack\" was coined by journalist David Blum in a 1985 New York Magazine profile of Emilio Estevez that contextualized Esteves and peers like Judd Nelson and Rob Lowe within the new dynamics of a Hollywood that sought to cater to the tastes of younger audiences. It was a not wholly flattering portrait that at times painted the actors as under-trained and overestimated, scoring free movie tickets that they could likely afford and picking up girls in the Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nReading the article today, audiences may be surprised at how far the label morphed and expanded outside its original classification. The name Molly Ringwald, the canonical Queen Bee of '80s coming-of-age cinema like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles, doesn't even appear in the story. \"It was always really more of an idea than a fixed thing. The culture decided who was in it,\" explains McCarthy.\n\nLargely, the Brat Pack is considered to be performers who, like McCarthy, appear in St. Elmo's Fire or the larger Hughes ouever. In the doc, the director talks to fellow Brat Pack-ers Esteves, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, and Lowe. They reveal how the label led to being typecast by a comp-obsessed Hollywood, missing out on roles and potential projects. They also talk about how age and decades worth of distance and full careers have bred an appreciation and new perspectives like inclusion in the Brat Pack may be, as McCarthy describes it, \"perhaps the biggest professional blessing of my life.\"\n\nAhead of Brats premiere on June 13 on Hulu, McCarthy talked about convincing his former co-stars to participate, a nerve-wracking interview with Charlie Rose and why a cultural phenom like the Brat Pack could never happen, again.\n\nWhy make Brats, now?\n\nI wrote a book called Brat about that time about my experiences of the Brat Pack, and what it felt like at the time and to look under that rock that I've run from for a long time. And it was really illuminating. So when I finished it, I thought, \"That's what I feel like. What does everybody else feel like?\" Someone said to me, we were members of a club, and we didn't ask to join, and we were the only members. We're the only ones that know what that felt like. As for why now: Yes, the movie is about the Brat Pack, but to me it's about how we interpret and make sense of the events of our lives and how our perception of them changes and evolves over time. I feel 180 degrees different about the Brat Pack now than I did 30-odd years ago. I hated it then. Now, I look at it as perhaps the biggest professional blessing of my life.\n\nYour own experience and history with the term \"Brat Pack\" is the cornerstone of Brats. When starting work on the doc, did you know that would be the case?\n\nI wasn't making a definitive Brat Pack movie, I was making a very subjective movie about my experience and this seismic event that happened in my life and maybe get some clarity on that. It's the evolution of my relationship to that term is what the event of the movie is to me. How we received it -- whether it was fair or not fair, whether we received it appropriately or selfishly like immature children -- none of that matters. What matters is that I did experience it that way and then it's come to be experienced in an entirely different way. That was fascinating to me. When I went and talked to people, one on one of them, I can't remember which, said, do you have questions for me that I can look at before you come? I'm like: No. I'm just gonna come talk to you. Even talking to David Blum when I called him and asked him if he'd do it, he said, \"What's your agenda?\" My only agenda is to see what was your experience of it then, what is it now and has that changed. That was my agenda for him and for everyone. I turned 60 last year so you get started looking at time differently, particularly when you get old.\n\nYour book Brat, where you explored similar topics and themes seen in the doc, seemed to be a more solitary experience, whereas the making of Brats was more of a communal conversation.\n\nThat's a really interesting point because we can experience these things and begin to grow and to understand them, alone. But it's so nice to connect with people. It reminds you of why we shouldn't be alone, and why we need community because that connection helps us feel less isolated. It's just a better feeling than when we're in our own heads alone. I can figure something out alone and go, 'Okay, that makes sense to me. All right, I'm good with that.' Once you share it with other people, and they share with you, this bond happens. That's why movies are so powerful. Like I said to Howie, this generation saw us on the screen, and they went, \"That's me. I feel less alone now.\" That's why we became famous and why people still love us because we represent that moment in their lives when they're just blossoming. That's a very scary, wondrous, and isolating time. So if you see yourself up on the screen and go, \"That's what I feel like.\" You can forever hold me or Molly or whoever is in that position. So, reconnecting with everyone, for me, was also meaningful in that way, as opposed to just holding it alone.\n\nAt what point did you know you wanted to talk to journalist David Blum?\n\nI always knew I would talk to him because he's the pink elephant in the room. He's the fifth Beatle. And I always wanted to talk to him. And his whole thing was: \"What's your agenda?\" My agenda is to hear your experience. Then he was willing to jump right in. And, frankly, [he was] a lot easier to schedule than everybody else was.\n\nThere is that great moment in the doc where you have gotten an interview canceled last minute and you are in the car and you recall your wife telling you that making the documentary would likely be a humbling experience. In that moment, you said you understood what she meant.\n\nI was like, oh my God, Rob canceled, again and I've got the whole crew here. So let's go talk to somebody because I paid for this crew. The whole movie was like that! It took a year. And it was maybe 10 days of filming but it took over a year to get everybody to sit down. Some days people would cancel and I'm like, \"Who can I call? [St. Elmo's Fire producer] Lauren Shuler would love to talk!\" It was all just me calling people that I knew and going, \"Will you talk to me about this?\"\n\nWhen did you reread the New York Magazine story?\n\nI can't remember when I reread it. I don't think I reread it for the book, but for the movie I did. And you know, when I reread it, I found it to be -- it's not so bad. I mean it's not like we [were] treated like Britney [Spears], you know what I mean? It wasn't that. It's kind of snarky in that '80s way. It was clearly, to me, him trying to make an impression to get himself into, as he said, Tina Brown's office. That was his agenda. His agenda wasn't to portray us in a clear, insightful way. His agenda was to get himself into Tina Brown's office and this is how he thought he could do it, which is fine. I can't remember when I reread it, but I didn't think it was as scathing as I did, initially.\n\nYou don't talk to Brat Pack players Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson in the doc and include their reasonings behind not participating in the doc. Why did that also feel like that was something you had to include?\n\nThey are in the movie, in a smart and sensitive way that I know them to be. I thought it just simply needed to be addressed in as quick and gracious way as possible. Otherwise, you would go, \"Where's Molly?\" And Judd was Judd. In the beginning, he agreed to do it and was wonderfully insightful. On camera, I'm saying [on the phone to Judd] \"Don't tell me now. Don't tell me. No, I want to get on film!\" He just launched in. And then he eventually became a unicorn and disappeared and decided he didn't want to do it. But I think even that is insightful and has insight into the Brat Pack.\n\nWas any one conversation the most edifying when it came to your understanding of the Brat Pack?\n\nWhat I found really illuminating to me was, is how it happened and why it happened at that moment. All the conditions that made the Brat Pack ripe to happen. There was this seismic, cultural change is happening where movies were suddenly about young people. Hollywood discovered kids go to the movies half a dozen times, grownups go once, the hell with the grownups, let's make movies for kids. And that happened overnight, and we were the ones right out in front of that. Youth culture was very unified -- all of our culture was pretty unified at that time. Every Friday night, every kid knew what movie they were going to see. Every kid was gonna see Karate Kid this week and Teen Wolf the next week. Now, [the culture] is so fractured. We can't even comprehend that. Then David Blum comes along next is really witty phrase calls, so Hollywood can grab us and put us in a satchel. We were just the ones who fit the costumes at the time. We were in the right place and the right time for that to happen. In my opinion, none of that could ever happen, again. People always say to me, \"Can you imagine now with social media what it would be like?\" It never would have happened. It wouldn't even have registered, except for a day or two in the news cycle.\n\nThe archival talk show interviews and television segments you have sprinkled throughout Brats were pretty great to watch. How was it to relive those?\n\nWhen we first dug up the Charlie Rose [interview] that begins and ends the movie I was like, \"Oh, no, don't show it to me! I don't want to look at it!\" It's like this kid is so uncomfortable and so scared. That was the first interview I've ever had where I was told to look at a dot on the camera and I'm like, \"I'm talking to a dot? He's on the other side?\"'\" That's why I was so afraid to look up because I felt so self-conscious looking at a dot. It was a very naive, innocent time. When we're doing archival stuff, I knew I wanted a moment when multiple journalists were saying, \"The Brat Pack! The Brat Pack. The Brat Pack.\" And I said it's only going to happen between June and August of 1985 because, after that, no publicists would allow any show that we ever went on to use the words \"Brat Pack.\" Our archival researchers, who were great, said, \"I can't find anybody saying that.\"'\" And I told them that's because you have to look at this one six-week window before all the publicists shut it down. Things like that all came back to me. We're also so naive and innocent and unsophisticated, in certain ways, and it was just kind of fantastic. It made me feel really tender toward everyone.\n\nThere wasn't as much media training in the way there is now.\n\nNo. It was, \"You go on and look at this dot.\"\n\nBut that meant there also wasn't any type of performance in those interviews.\n\nWe were all just experiencing it and coming of age and growing up and figuring it out, in real time. That's why a bunch of times we used [the footage] from before the interview starts where we are just sitting there like deer in the headlights. That appears a lot in the film: Us just sitting there, not knowing what to do, which was what it felt like at the time.\n\nI don't think we will ever see moments like that, again, either.\n\nNo. There is too much protection and people are too savvy. When I did an audition tape for my first movie, Class, I'd never seen myself on tape, moving. I'd never seen myself moving through space before. Everyone's so much more sophisticated now and self-aware and self-conscious in a way that we just were not. But of course, at that time, we thought we were at the cutting edge of sophistication.\n\nWhat do you hope audiences glean from Brats?\n\nI suppose in the same way they saw themselves in us in those movies, whether they do it consciously or not, I hope they see their own journey through life in our journey with this relationship with the Brat Pack. Like: I felt this way about certain seismic events in my life and over time and with different understandings, I have come to feel a different way about it. All these things that we go through, depending on how we choose to perceive them and experience them, can lead to positive things.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news",

However, there are two notable members of the group missing from the documentary: Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson.\n\nRingwald and Nelson are synonymous with the Brat Pack. Ringwald starred in Brat Pack hits like Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Pretty in Pink. Nelson starred alongside Ringwald in The Breakfast Club and appeared with more Brat Packers in St. Elmo's Fire.\n\nSo, why are Ringwald and Nelson missing from the Brats documentary, except for archival footage?\n\nMcCarthy's Pretty in Pink co-star Jon Cryer asks him during their discussion if he's spoken to Ringwald. McCarthy says he's reached out to Ringwald about participating. \"She said she'd think about it, but that she would probably just like to keep looking forward.\"\n\nCryer acknowledges that Ringwald wants to \"move on\" and \"taken without the baggage of our pop cultural references as an actor.\"\n\nMcCarthy, who directed the documentary, tries to reach out to Nelson, who is off the grid. He has to contact Nelson's manager to get his phone number. At the end of the documentary, McCarthy receives a call from Nelson, but it's unclear what they talked about.\n\nAhead of the documentary's premiere, Nelson spoke out about why he declined to appear in Brats. \"It seems strange to have that subject matter be something for edited entertainment,\" the actor to Us Weekly in March 2024. \"Also, like, he's a nice guy, but I hadn't seen him in 35 years. And it's like, I'm not going to [be] like, 'Hey!' No, dude.\"\n\nRelated'Brats' on Hulu: Everything to Know About Hulu's Brat Pack Docuseries\n\nNelson continued, \"It's like, why kind of rebirth something that wasn't necessarily fun? ... How can we be experts on something that didn't ever really exist?\"\n\nDespite Ringwald and Nelson's absences, McCarthy was able to talk to several figures connected to the Brat Pack about their experience. The director doesn't hold any ill will to those who turned down his offer.\n\n\"The Brat Pack is an ongoing relationship, you know what I mean? And some people are at different places in their lives to want to or not want to talk about it. I think that just informs it even more. I mean, that's my takeaway from it,\" McCarthy told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Anthony Michael Hall, who starred in Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, does not appear in Brats and is not mentioned in the documentary.\n\nBrats, Streaming Now, Hulu\n\nMore Headlines:\n\nDid 'Criminal Minds: Evolution' Just Introduce Series' Most Disturbing Storyline Yet?'Evil' Bosses Talk Andy's Sacrifice & Ben's Feelings for KristenMark James, Songwriter Behind 'Suspicious Minds' & 'Hooked on a Feeling,' Dies at 83'Bridgerton' Embraces Queer Stories in Season 3: What It Could Mean Moving ForwardMama June & Daughter Alana Address 'Stolen' Money Scandal in New Video\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "khq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KHQ Right Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelson (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pretty in Pink (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Candles_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "16 Candles (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(Elton_John_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice (Elton John song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspicious Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooked_on_a_Feeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hooked on a Feeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Minds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal Minds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scandal (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.fox41yakima.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Top-Stories-Entertainment-1141.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

For me, the new Brat Pack documentary feels personal", "body": "Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, left to right, in \"The Breakfast Club,\" a 1985 hit that helped cement the Brat Pack mystique.\n\nWhen I watch the trailer for Andrew McCarthy's new documentary, \"Brats,\" my pulse races as if I'm watching old home movies of myself and my friends.\n\nI'm not a Hollywood star -- ahem! -- and I don't know anyone in the film, but I have frantically searched the Internet for more on the movie, which revisits a group of young actors -- principally Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Anthony Michael Hall and McCarthy himself -- who came to be known in the 1980s as the \"Brat Pack.\"\n\nThese former stars made movies during one of the most pivotal periods in my life, when I left behind my childhood, entered the fraught universe of my teen years and became aware that boys were interesting. Maybe a little too interesting.\n\nMcCarthy's documentary, which premieres today on Hulu, explores the lives today of actors who starred in such films as \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Sixteen Candles,\" \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"Pretty in Pink.\" The film is not about my life, but judging from the trailer it's full of my memories and music.\n\nOn its surface, \"Brats\" is about the stars we '80s kids lived and died by (and how they didn't like the \"Brat Pack\" label). On a deeper level it also appears to be about the passage of time, the vagaries of fate and the way labels can loom large enough to change lives.\n\nWhen the Brat Pack movies came out, I was a Long Island girl, on the cusp of my teen years. The youngest of four daughters, I woke up each day to my clock radio playing Top 40 or New Wave. I read \"Seventeen\" magazine religiously and frequented the mall, where I could watch coming attractions of new movies -- including previews of R-rated films forbidden by my Catholic mother.\n\nThe first movie I saw to star some of the Brat Packers was 1983's \"The Outsiders,\" the drama about rival youth gangs in early-'60s Oklahoma. It's not strictly considered a Brat Pack movie, but it features Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez, two charter members of the club. My oldest sister, Tricia, loved it, So I did, too.\n\nI was too young to watch it right away but I read the book a dozen times to match the number of times Tricia saw the movie. I still have my dog-eared paperback of the S.E. Hinton classic, and the faded cover is torn just below the image of actor C. Thomas Howell.\n\nThe movie was set in a different era far from my Long Island town, and featured terms like \"greasers\" that meant nothing to me. But it had the same teenage angst I was feeling, and some of the hottest actors I'd ever seen. During a sleepover at a friend's house, we rewound the videocassette on the VCR countless times trying to catch the unscripted moment when Lowe's towel almost falls off after he's taken a shower. Lowe was older and even better-looking -- if that's possible -- two years later in \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" where he played a recent college grad.\n\nWhat made these movies so alluring to me was one simple fact: The characters -- high school students, college students and even young professionals -- showed me a world I hadn't yet fully entered. It was the world of my older sisters, and as any little girl will tell you, that's the world that matters the most.\n\nMolly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy and Jon Cryer in 1986's \"Pretty in Pink.\"\n\nMoviestore/Shutterstock\n\nLike many younger siblings, I experience nostalgia not just for my own childhood and adolescence but for the many events I experienced vicariously through my sisters. Whatever films or actors or musicians caught my sisters' attention inevitably captured mine.\n\nThe movie that most captured the attention of my sister, Denise, was \"Pretty in Pink.\" Just like the Molly Ringwald character, Denise loved to shop for vintage clothing. She and I would take the Long Island Railroad into New York City, visiting shops like Canal Jean Co. and Antique Boutique in Greenwich Village where we'd skim the racks of 1940s men's suit jackets and vintage jeans. We pored over magazine spreads that showed the looks from these films and tried to emulate them.\n\nWhen I asked Denise recently about the movie, she recalled seeing it over and over in the theater, not only because she thought Ringwald was \"the coolest\" but also because back in that pre-Netflix era, teens went out to the movies. That may partly explain why these movies loom so large for me.\n\n\"Going to the movies was the big thing to do every Friday and Saturday night,\" Denise said.\n\nWe listened to her cassette tape of the \"Pretty in Pink\" soundtrack on repeat in our house and I can remember blaring the movie's big hit, \"If You Leave,\" by OMD, at high volume. Its heartache sentiments might strike some people as sappy, but for me it still conjures the feeling of falling hard for someone.\n\nI soaked it all in, and in a scrapbook I made during high school, I pasted pictures from magazines of the bands I liked, including New Order, INXS and the Psychedelic Furs, who recorded \"Pretty in Pink's\" title song.\n\nI also was enchanted by Demi Moore's smart-mouthed character, Jules, in \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" who delivered snarky comments with a smoky, world-weary voice. That was the kind of woman I wanted to become (although the scenes of her meltdown after she locked herself in her apartment didn't reflect my naturally upbeat personality but then again, I wasn't dealing with my \"stepmonster's funeral.\")\n\nThe Brat Packers became unwitting role models for me. This was partly because some of the movies were written and directed by John Hughes, who in the mid-1980s portrayed young adult life in a way that was much more realistic than ABC after-school specials or TV shows like \"The Brady Bunch.\" Film critic Roger Ebert once called Hughes \"the philosopher of adolescence.\"\n\nAlly Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Mare Winningham and Andrew McCarthy in \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" Unlike most of the Brat Pack movies, it wasn't written or directed by John Hughes.\n\nMoviestore/Shutterstock\n\nHughes' characters spoke our language and got our visual cues. In one scene in \"Sixteen Candles,\" a poster of the band Culture Club hangs on the wall. It resonated with me because my sister, Liz, was crazy about Boy George. In \"The Breakfast Club,\" Hughes explored how a popular girl like Claire, played by Ringwald, would be seen as more important than other students and how even someone as outwardly rebellious as Judd Nelson's character, John Bender, would feel stung by the implicit pecking order.\n\nAs the Brat Pack era dawned, I was attending a public school where I didn't care for the industrious kids in my Honors class but was too bookish for the popular crowd. In my sophomore year, I transferred to a Catholic high school that I loved partly because doing well academically didn't isolate you socially. The president of the Honor Society was also the cutest guy in the school.\n\nBut it was in a far wealthier town than my own, and some of the preppy kids were rich and obnoxious like James Spader's character in \"Pretty in Pink.\"\n\nSoon after transferring, I tapped a perfectly thin, perfectly attired blonde on the shoulder in math class to ask her a question. I'd noticed that her uniform skirt fit her perfectly and clung to her sinewy frame while mine was loose, bulky and unflattering. Her family must have paid a seamstress to trim the skirt. She turned around, took one look at my hair-sprayed bangs -- I hadn't yet adopted the preppy bob that was popular at the school -- and then turned away without saying a word. I was beneath her.\n\nToday, some 40 years later, I can say some of the Brat Pack films hold up better than others. \"The Breakfast Club,\" for example, is deservedly in the National Film Registry, which recognizes movies of cultural significance.\n\nBut the performances and scenes in \"St. Elmo's Fire\" now strike me as trite. (Remember Rob Lowe's sax-playing character climbing out on the roof?) And of course, \"Sixteen Candles,\" despite some tender and hilarious moments, was sexist and racist. The one non-White character was an Asian exchange student, Long Duk Dong, a crude stereotype played for laughs. And the character played by Anthony Michael Hall is encouraged to have sex with a girl who is passed-out drunk.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, from left, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore and Jon Cryer attend the \"Brats\" premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 7, 2024, in New York.\n\nCharles Sykes/Invision/AP\n\nBut what does hold up is the films' music.\n\nThe song that closes out \"The Breakfast Club\" -- Simple Minds' \"Don't You Forget About Me\" -- remains an iconic embodiment of the raucous feelings of that era of my life. It plays as Judd Nelson's troubled rebel walks away from the school, fist defiantly raised, a moment after Ringwald's princess character has placed in his hand one of her diamond earrings.\n\nThe mismatched classmates have formed an unlikely bond, and we're all swooning. I could sleep for a thousand years and would still wake up knowing the words: \"As you walk on by, will you call my name?\"\n\nSoundtracks from the MTV era help these movies transcend moments that have aged poorly, and my own penchant for nostalgia helps when even the music falters. John Parr's \"Man in Motion\" from \"St. Elmo's Fire\" is cheesy, but in its over-the-top earnestness I can still feel my breathless excitement over the film and its actors.\n\nAs McCarthy wrote in a 2021 memoir that gave rise to his documentary, \"It's not just the work; maybe now more importantly, it is the memory of the work that's so valuable to people.\" The movies came out for all of us '80s kids \"when the future was a blank slate, when anything was possible.\"\n\nNow he has made a documentary that I have no choice but to watch because he's investigated not only his distant past but a part of mine, too.\n\nI can't wait to see what he found out about a moment we shared through the silver screen and what it all meant -- if it really mattered. Actually, forget that last part. It definitely mattered.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanne_bonner@cnn.com", "name": "Jeanne Bonner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pretty in Pink (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(filmmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Hughes (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(American_magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seventeen (American magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Candles_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "16 Candles (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Thomas_Howell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C.

On June 10, 1985, New York Magazine published Hollywood's Brat Pack. I just remember seeing that cover going oh bleep. I never talked to anyone about what that was like,\" McCarthy said in a clip from the \"Brats\" documentary.\n\nNearly 40 years after that article, McCarthy is out with a documentary exploring the cultural phenomenon of that time. It's called, \"Brats.\"\n\nJoelle Garguillo: It is such a pleasure, I'm going to try to contain myself and not geek out too much. But congratulations on this.\n\nAndrew McCarthy: Thanks, very much.\n\nGarguilo: What was life like before that article came out just in the sense of like being part of this group to usher in a whole new phase in Hollywood?\n\nMcCarthy: It's hard to imagine now, but movies didn't always used to be about young people and youth culture. And that was the moment when everything kind of changed and Hollywood studios realized, wait, kids go to the movies 5, 6, 7 times, grownups go once, good... let's make movies for kids. And overnight almost every movie started to be about and for young people, starring young people. And we were there right at the start. And so it was this extraordinary and wondrous kind of time.\n\nAnd then the article, it's impact was explored in \"Brats.\"\n\nGarguilo: Why now?\n\nMcCarthy: I, you know, as we get old, we start to sort of view our past differently. We hated the term, we hated it. You know, that's also hard to realize now, because it's become such an iconic affectionate sort of beloved term, that it wasn't always that way.\n\nGarguilo: Just to be clear, at the time, it was not changing your life for the better.\n\nMcCarthy: Oh, it was scathing at the time. It was that time, and you know, New York journalism grill, snarky kind of journalists and it was really, negative pejorative article, he really was scathing about all of us.\n\nAfter that, everybody wanted to be in \"The Brat Pack,\" except \"The Brat Pack.\"\n\nGarguilo: What was life like, before that article? And what was life like after that article?\n\nMcCarthy: That's what the movie's about, is going from, wait, there was this thing that we hated. And now all these many centuries later, it's become this sort of, for me, personally, it's become probably the greatest professional blessing of my life, you know, and I didn't always think of it that way, in what ways because people of a certain generation will come up to me almost daily on the street and go, oh, my God, that 'Brat Pack,' oh, those movies. And they'll start talking and their eyes will start to glaze over. And I realized they're not even talking to me anymore. They're talking to their own youth, and I am the mirror or the avatar of their youth. And so they're talking about that moment in time when of coming of age, when it's a thrilling wondrous time in life, when your whole worlds a blank slate to be written on. And I represent that to a certain generation.\n\nGarguilo: Can you just describe the energy of getting back together?\n\nMcCarthy: When we saw each other again, for the first time in all these years. It's like, we're from the same litter. We just looked each other on oh my God, it's you, you know. So I saw Ali, and I instantly had a crush on her again. It was all very kind of sweet.\n\nGarguilo: I want you all to do more together. Now.\n\nMcCarthy: That's what we're just all talking about. Okay, we're going do some, we're going to do something because there's a there's an audience for it.\n\nGarguilo: Clearly, there's an audience for it.\n\nMcCarthy: I think there's an appetite for it for us too. I mean, we were all, we were, I think everyone was surprised how much like, wow, yeah, this is meaningful on a personal level. It was quite meaningful.\n\nGarguilo: Can I ask you about 'Pretty in Pink' anything that the public doesn't know about your time?\n\nMcCarthy: I mean, the most iconic story of the project the public doesn't know is, we changed the ending entirely.", "source": {"uri": "6abc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "6abc Action News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brats_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brats (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pretty in Pink (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming of age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youth culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14943836_061324-wabc-andrew-mccarthy-img.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-06-", "textStart": 487, "textEnd": 494}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Two Words Made Them Question That.", "body": "The new documentary \"Brats\" attempts to take aim at a magazine narrative without recognizing the privilege of being young, white and famous.\n\nIt takes about 30 minutes of writer-director Andrew McCarthy's new documentary \"Brats\" to realize that it's not really about anything. Or rather, it's about vaguely hurt feelings.\n\nThat's not to seem inconsiderate. Celebrities are human and well within their right, just as much as anyone else, to explore the difficult emotions they have about something that has impacted them -- for better and worse.\n\n\"Brats\" is trying to have a complex conversation, though it mostly exists on vibes. The film reflects on the effects of the \"Brat Pack\" moniker, given to a group of young white movie stars in the '80s, including McCarthy, by journalist David Blum in a 1985 New York magazine article.\n\nIt was a nod to the \"Rat Pack,\" which referenced a similarly popular group of entertainers but from the '40s and '50s -- including Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin -- that was a catchy phrase to describe wildly successful superstars/friends who often partied and worked together.\n\nAccording to legend, it was actor Lauren Bacall who originally came up with the otherwise throwaway name when she walked in on Davis, Frank Sinatra, Martin and the others having an alcohol-fueled good time in Vegas one evening and said, \"You look like a goddamn rat pack.\"\n\nThen she turned on her heels and walked away, probably.\n\nOK, that last line was added there for effect. But also to highlight a phrase Bacall likely instantly forgot about. Davis, Sinatra and the others were well respected and enjoyed success throughout the end of their lives, apparently unaffected by the \"Rat Pack\" label.\n\nMcCarthy has a different perspective of what happened to him and his group, though. Or so he aims to articulate in \"Brats.\"\n\nYes, he and his peers -- including Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez -- were making big money, went to clubs and often co-starred in films like 1985's \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" But they were also, as per the director's biggest gripe, serious actors.\n\nThey were in great films like 1980's \"Ordinary People,\" 1982's \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\" 1983's \"The Outsiders\" and \"Risky Business,\" and 1985's \"Back to the Future\" and \"The Breakfast Club.\" McCarthy feels like the article and moniker that followed the actors in other interviews, which he includes in archival form in the film, didn't capture that.\n\nFor whatever it's worth at this point, Blum's article does a very good job of dropping the reader right into the scene, illuminating its actor subjects exactly where they're at (a bustling scene at the Hard Rock Cafe in LA, to be exact) -- which is the mark of any great writing. It captures the point that they're young, white-hot in Hollywood and having lots of fun with their new fame.\n\nWhat it doesn't do is create a particularly flattering image of the stars. They come off a little flighty and self-involved. For instance, Estevez checks out a \"Playmate of the Month\" nearby. It's also sarcastic at times, complete with a list of Brat Pack superlatives, such as \"The Hottest of Them All -- Tom Cruise, 23\" or \"The Most Gifted of Them All -- Sean Penn, 24.\"\n\nIt's cheeky, and gets its largest point across that a traditionally older Hollywood had seemingly suddenly birthed a previously elusive class of young actors in their 20s that were thriving.\n\nTo put this into a more current perspective, consider it along the lines of how Elle magazine recently published its \"Hollywood Rising Class of 2024\" package highlighting the new and hot young stars on the block. Blum's article pulls off the veneer, but it accomplishes a similar thing.\n\nFrom a journalist perspective, the \"Brat Pack\" piece, which only mentions McCarthy once, by the way, is a masterful snapshot that serves as a good reminder that journalists aren't interviewing stars to be their friends. They're there to tell the truth about what they see and what you tell them. Nothing more.\n\nThat's a hard fact that McCarthy only kinda realizes in \"Brats,\" even though Estevez, who the director interviews at what appears to be a mansion in the film, is the one to raise this point for him. \"Brats\" follows McCarthy as he attempts to reunite with some of the actors mentioned in or associated with the \"Brat Pack\" article to hear their thoughts on how it affected them.\n\nIn short, it didn't seem to have as grave an impact on them as it did on McCarthy's sense of self and his own career. Moore, who recently garnered acclaim at the Cannes International Film Festival for \"The Substance,\" adds crucial nuance, reminding McCarthy that they were all young and, for her in particular, juggling both ambition and excess. They were far from perfect.\n\nLowe playfully asks McCarthy whether a certain drunken night even happened, alluding to an evening where Davis himself appeared, during a rare clashing of both worlds. Lowe's and McCarthy's conversation infuses the film with a hint of nostalgia while reflecting on hard-learned facts about themselves and the privilege they all had early in their careers.\n\nThe interviews with actors Lea Thompson, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer and Timothy Hutton, who are all steadily working as the aforementioned, are versions of the same thing, and once again raise a critical question about \"Brats\": What is it about, actually? We don't really get the answer.\n\nMcCarthy continues to seek a sense of justification for his feelings as he meets with \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire\" producer, Lauren Shuler Donner, who rightfully tells him that \"Brat Pack\" was one of the best things that actually happened to his career. Because then everybody knew his name.\n\nBingo. Not every actor gets to say that.\n\nAs if finally coming to terms with what he's projecting with the title of his film, it's scenes that highlight McCarthy's curiosity and humility that are far more interesting to watch yet few and far between. Like when the director sits down with Blum, who graciously appears in the film and essentially tells him that he would write the exact same article today after he's pressed about it.\n\nIt's clear that McCarthy in this moment seeks some kind of acknowledgment of wrongdoing that he doesn't ever really get. They have a very thoughtful conversation that may or may not have satisfied the director, but certainly crystallizes the obvious misunderstanding between journalist and subject.\n\nThe recognition of privilege is something no one puts into sharper focus than Ira Madison III, a Black and queer cultural critic who is also the only non-white person in the entire documentary. Madison tells McCarthy that Black folks like him who grew up watching films with \"Brat Pack\" members were compelled to see themselves in their stories. And they often did so fondly.\n\nFrustratingly, McCarthy doesn't really engage with what Madison is actually saying there. He acknowledges it as true, but it would have behooved the director, amid his own seemingly self-obsessed rant about a nearly 40-year-old moniker, to also think about the advantages he was also granted with it that eluded many others.\n\nThere are several discussions that would have deepened \"Brats,\" which ultimately leaves the audience with the question of, well, were they brats, actually? Was the label deserved in that way? Considering the way the documentary unfolds, an even more awkward question rises to the fore: Is McCarthy still a brat?\n\nMaybe that's his point, but that would be a bit of a cop-out. There's a great opportunity here to truly delve into what it feels like to have to wrestle with whether you're a good actor or just famous, young and white? Blum's article, to McCarthy's overarching point, leaves that unclear.\n\nBut that's how a lot of media labels function. They don't exist to validate the actor or their talent. (That's what their management team should be doing). They're there to engage with their readers and audience, to help identify this person or group of people in a fun and/or truthful way so that they're remembered at all.\n\nMany celebs are vying for the attention of audiences. Not all of them get to be part of a \"Brat Pack\" or be the \"Sexiest Man Alive,\" or certainly not a \"Nepo Baby,\" a phrase that merely speaks to an undeniable truth about privilege in Hollywood yet somehow still manages to confuse. These are labels that make up some semblance of truth about who they are as celebrities.\n\nBy the end of \"Brats,\" it's hard to tell whether McCarthy actually reconciles any of that. Actor Judd Nelson, one of several actors he spends much of the film trying in vain to connect with (Ringwald is another one), finally calls him back.\n\nWill that conversation be just another trip down memory lane to satisfy nostalgia-hungry audiences or another effort for McCarthy to validate his own conflicted feelings? Or will he actually feel challenged? We never get to see how the conversation with Nelson plays out. The movie ends there, and so does any hope that anyone learns anything from this.", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Other actors who appeared often in Brat Pack movies include Robert Downey, Jr., James Spader and John Cusack.)\n\nThey were coined the Brat Pack by a New York Magazine writer in 1985 -- and deeply resented the label. \"It did have personal ramifications,\" McCarthy told PEOPLE of the nickname ahead of his Hulu documentary BRATS, which reunites the iconic '80s stars to discuss their movies and experiences. \"Were we brats? We were certainly privileged. But there wasn't anything great about us. We were just in the right place at the right time and represented that seismic change in pop culture. You're easy prey when you're exposed in that way.\"\n\nStill, the Brat Pack has become a permanent fixture in nostalgia for the 1980s -- and changed the movie industry forever. \"Suddenly Hollywood realized kids go to the movies way more than adults,\" McCarthy explained. \"We've been inundated with movies for young people ever since, but before that, movies were not for the young.\"\n\nAmong those movies were plenty of popular coming-of-age films like Sixteen Candles and The Outsiders. And just like there's no official list of Brat Pack members, there's no official list of Brat Pack movies -- but 12 feature at least two of the group in them. Ahead, read all about the Brat Pack's movies.\n\nIf you've ever heard the phrase \"Stay golden, Ponyboy,\" then you definitely know something about The Outsiders. When it debuted in 1983, the movie introduced the world to a new generation of A-list actors like Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze and Matt Dillon. Based on the 1967 novel by S.E. Hinton, the film was directed by Frances Ford Coppola and centered on teenagers of different socioeconomic statuses clashing in 1965 Tulsa. The Outsiders featured Lowe in his first feature film role (as Sodapop) and Estevez in one of his earliest roles (as Two-Bit).\n\nMcCarthy's first feature film appearance was a starring role in 1983's Class, which was also Cusack's film debut and Lowe's second film. In the movie, McCarthy's \"Jonathan\" is new to a posh private school, where Lowe's \"Skip\" is his roommate. After a bumpy start, they become fast friends -- until McCarthy becomes involved with an older woman and the relationship threatens everything.\n\nThe film that introduced the world to Jake Ryan, Sixteen Candles, premiered in 1984 and was John Hughes' directorial debut. The movie features Molly Ringwald as Sam, who's navigating life as a teenager, surviving high school and turning 16 as her extended family descends on her house for her sister's wedding. When they do, they forget her birthday -- but one very important boy doesn't. Anthony Michael Hall plays The Geek, who has an unrequited crush on Sam, and John and Joan Cusack have small roles.\n\nA less memorable entry into the Brat Pack canon, 1984's Oxford Blues starred Lowe as a lovesick teenager trying to woo the object of his affection, the British Lady Victoria Wingate. He follows her to England, enrolls in Oxford, meets Rona (played by Ally Sheedy) and, as expected, hijinks ensue. A young Cary Elwes also appears in one of his earliest roles, just a few years before The Princess Bride.\n\nOne of the most iconic 1980s movies, The Breakfast Club had an almost all-Brat Pack cast. In the John Hughes classic, five high school students from different social groups -- \"a brain, an athlete, a basketcase, a princess and a criminal\" -- have all-day Saturday detention, and are tasked with writing essays that day with the topic \"who you think you are.\" What they find out is that the five of them, who seem extremely different at the outset, have a lot more common ground than they realized.\n\nThe 1985 film stars Ringwald as Claire, the popular, preppy girl; Estevez as Andy, the jock wrestler; Sheedy as Allison, the reclusive weirdo; Hall as Brian, the brainy nerd; and Judd Nelson as Bender, the rebellious outcast.\n\n\"The movie has this message that in spite of people's differences, there is something unifying in the experience of growing up and trying to find yourself,\" Sheedy told PEOPLE in 2015.\n\nThe same year, another of the seminal Brat Pack films debuted: 1985's St. Elmo's Fire. The film, set in Washington D.C., follows a group of friends who have recently graduated from Georgetown University as they hang out at their favorite watering hole, St. Elmo's Bar, and try to navigate adult life for the first time. Alec (Nelson) is a politico who's in a relationship with Leslie (Sheedy); he's pressuring her to get married, but she suspects he's unfaithful. Kevin (McCarthy) is an aspiring writer who's secretly in love with Leslie. Kirby (Estevez) is hopelessly obsessed with Dale (Andie MacDowell), and takes a questionable job to impress her. Jules (Demi Moore) is wealthy but troubled by her absent parents. Party boy Billy (Lowe) dropped out from partying too much, and is now reluctantly married with a baby and struggling to meet his responsibilities. Sheltered good girl Wendy (Mare Winningham) is longing for independence and is endlessly helping Billy because of her unrequited crush on him.\n\nOf his role as Billy, Lowe told PEOPLE, \"I became so identified with it -- the wild, fun, rock and roll, quasi-debauched with the heart of gold [guy]: that's my early twenties in a nutshell.\"\n\nAnother John Hughes film, 1986's Pretty in Pink was named after a Psychedelic Furs song -- and New Wave music plays a big role in the film. In 2013, Rolling Stone named the Pretty in Pink soundtrack among the 25 best of all time.\n\nIn it, Andie (Ringwald) is an artsy, offbeat teenager who's keeping her underemployed dad afloat by working at a record store. Her best friend Duckie (Jon Cryer) is a loveable weirdo desperately in love with her -- but she's enamored with one of the \"richies\" in high school, Blane (Andrew McCarthy). They try to date, but are pulled apart by their friends: Duckie is adamantly against Blane, questioning his intentions; Blane's best friend Steff (James Spader) sows resentment against Andie because he's burned by her rejection of him. They finally reconnect at the prom, where Andie has repurposed an out-of-date prom dress into her own creation, and the sparks fly.\n\nAnother rare box office flop for the Brat Pack was the 1986 thriller Blue City, starring Nelson as Billy, who has returned to his Florida hometown to discover that his father was mysteriously killed. In seeking revenge, Billy reconnects with his best friend Joey and Joey's sister Annie (Sheedy). After traumatic losses, Billy and Annie escape together.\n\nIn this steamy 1986 comedy-drama, Lowe and Moore play Dan and Debbie, who are figuring out their first serious relationship together. They meet at a softball game, have an immediate connection and spend the night together. After a conversation \"about last night,\" they decide to keep seeing each other, but things inevitably get complicated despite their strong feelings for each other.\n\nTalking to Good Morning America in January 2024, Moore opened up about the impact of the \"Brat Pack\" moniker on her and her costar. \"For Rob, it kind of just slid off his back,\" she said. \"For me, I didn't love it, being thought of as a brat because I thought it kind of diminished us as professionals.\"\n\n\"It's really interesting cause you know, the Brat Pack moniker that came about really didn't have anything to do with us as people, as professionals,\" she added. \"It was just a clever headline.\"\n\nThis 1986 crime drama, written and directed by Estevez, is the actor's filmmaking debut. He plays John Wisdom, who was convicted of grand theft auto and, struggling to find a job, feels detached from society. He and his girlfriend Karen, played by Moore, go on a Robin Hood-style crime spree -- but instead of stealing money, they break into banks to erase records and give struggling people relief from their debts.\n\nIn this 1988 film, McCarthy stars as Matt, a college student who meets Jewel (Ringwald) by chance and tries to help her out of desperate circumstances. Jewel is a teenager in an abusive marriage, who married only to escape her abusive stepfather -- but despite his feelings for her, Matt can only do so much to help. Fresh Horses also features Ben Stiller and Viggo Mortensen in some of their earliest film roles.\n\nReleased in 1990, Betsy's Wedding is generally considered the final Brat Pack movie. In it, Ringwald plays Betsy, who's engaged to be married to Jake (played by Dylan Walsh), a man from a much wealthier family. In order to impress his future in-laws, Betsy's father Eddie (Alan Alda, who wrote and directed the film) gets himself in way over his head financially, and resorts to some unsavory characters to pay the bills. Sheedy plays Betsy's sister Connie.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Candles_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "16 Candles (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(filmmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Hughes (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowe's", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lowe's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Downey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andie_MacDowell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andie MacDowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._E._Hinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

This group was often described as a play on Frank Sinatra's famous \"Rat Pack\" from the 1950s and '60s.\n\nThe Brat Pack included stars such as Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, and Ally Sheedy. Some of the famous movies featuring members of the Brat Pack include \"Sixteen Candles,\" \"The Breakfast Club,\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\"\n\nIn 1985, a New York magazine cover story coined the term 'Brat Pack' for Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, and Judd Nelson, a label that not only defined a generation of actors but also left an indelible mark on pop culture, a legacy explored in McCarthy's documentary.\n\nABC News sat down with McCarthy for an in-depth discussion, where he shared his reflections on that era and the experience of reconnecting with his former Brat Pack colleagues after a decadeslong hiatus, a key theme in his new documentary.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: The 1980s was a time of blockbuster movie hits like \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Pretty in Pink,\" \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"16 Candles.\" The actors in these films were branded as the Brat Pack. However, the actors most associated with the Brat Pack movies often had a tumultuous relationship with that term. Now, actor and director Andrew McCarthy takes a deeper dive into that phase of his life and its impact on Hollywood. Let's take a look at a clip from his new documentary, \"BRATS.\"\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: Love that clip. Joining us now, Andrew McCarthy himself. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\nMCCARTHY: Nice to be here.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: So you really kind of take on this kind of investigative reporter role, connecting the dots, reaching out to the old friends. What made you decide to do this?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, several years ago, I wrote a book about my experience and of that time in the '80s, because it was such a life-changing experience and was a seminal time for me. I changed who I became, and when I finished the book, I kind of realized my feelings about it had actually moved probably 180 degrees. I hated the term at first. I didn't like it, and that I'd grown to sort of embrace it is probably the biggest professional gift of my life.\n\nAnd so I thought I would go seek out the other members of the gang because we're only few people in this club, you know, and we're the only ones. Well, I don't know how exclusive, but we were the only ones who had it happen. You know, it happened to. So I just thought I'd get their take on what it was, you know, and I. And it was really surprising and interesting. Liberating, really.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: What was the issue with the term in the beginning, and what prompted you to really evolve over time to ultimately embrace it?\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, I think it was a combination of different cultural events that were happening because it was in the early/mid-'80s when youth movies just took over in a way they never had been before. You know, it's a seismic cultural shift. It's hard for us to realize now because all movies are sort of geared toward a young adolescent mentality. But back then it wasn't the case, and this was the beginning of that.\n\nAnd then, you know, this article came along that branded us as the Brat Pack. And so there was suddenly a handle you could grab onto, and it just became, caught fire. The term, because it's such a witty, clever term. And so, you know, and it was sort of disparaging and negative. One, who wants to be called a brat, who wants to be lumped in a pack and all that? And so at first we, you know, we recoiled from it.\n\nBut the public was, I think, a lot smarter than us and realized right away that, like, we represented them, you know, for that generation up there. And we were like the cool kids. And so, they always embraced it. And it took me a lot, just a lot longer than them to realize that, you know, this was an amazing thing.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: It was such really an iconic era of, of films. And I think the people have this, at least those who are outside of the Hollywood circles. This idea maybe romanticize that. Oh, those characters are really friends in real life, and they hang out and spend time together during the movies and after, but kind of hip us to the game of of how that really might not be true.\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, I mean, I think we just sort of, well, work together. And then when that was done, we all went home. But we did represent that kind of, you know, because also movies before that were about so largely romantic love. It was about you and me get together and we then we break up and then and then we get back together. And that's the movie.\n\nBut those movies put friendship at the center. And that was new at that time. You know, \"Friends\" hadn't existed yet. St. Elmo's Fire is just a precursor to \"Friends.\" It's just about a group of kids who just graduated college, and they all hang out together. And, you know, would friends have happened without the Brat Pack? Yeah, probably. But we drove a, you know, a truck through that to open it up for people. And we forget that now. You know.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: You've done a book, now you've done a movie on a documentary.\n\nMCCARTHY: I know; it's just relentless, isn't it?\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: Is it healing? Is it, is it cathartic? Is it nostalgic? How would you describe the process?\n\nMCCARTHY: I mean, I would say it's more liberating than anything else. You know, it was a period I ran from and sort of stuffed under a rock and sort of I look under the rock and experience it from my own perspective was one thing, OK, let's figure out what I feel about it. But then to go connect with you or whoever else, those people that shared it with me, then you have a sense of community about it.\n\nAnd then once we have a sense of community, we're not so isolated. We're not so alone. I mean, that's, it's so powerful about movies. That's why those kids loved us because they saw us, you know, and they saw themselves in us. So suddenly they're not alone and they're not isolated anymore. And they can identify with Molly Ringwald, feelings of isolation or whatever, you know, and so, especially in that time of late adolescence or something, it's a real seismic time in your life. You're blossoming, you're coming of age, and people often feel very separate and different. And we allowed them to sort of feel seen.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Pack", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming of age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Sinatra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c61f020d-9f3f-4f98-ac4c-5673ccc2843a/240612_view_s5_andrewmccarthy1_west_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

He explained in the new BRATS documentary that it felt like the members were each other's \"kryptonite.\"\n\n\"I get the most upset about it because I had already seen a different path for myself, and I felt derailed. I didn't do a movie because of it,\" Emilio, 62, told fellow Brat Pack member Andrew McCarthy in the doc, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 7 and will begin streaming on Hulu on Thursday, June 13, of the negative impact the Brat Pack name had on his career. \"This was Young Men With Unlimited Capital, which was one of the best scripts I had read in a long time.\"\n\nAndrew, 61, admitted to Emilio that he was also asked to do Young Men With Unlimited Capital, but he learned that The Mighty Ducks actor \"didn't want\" him to participate in the film, which hurt Andrew's feelings. Emilio reassured him that it wasn't a direct issue with Andrew -- it was the Brat Pack as a whole.\n\n\"I didn't want to have anything to do with any of us. Do you know what I mean? I just didn't want to do any movies. If it were Judd, I would have said the same thing,\" he explained. \"To be seen again in another film would ultimately and could potentially have a negative impact. Working together just almost felt like we were kryptonite to each other.\"\n\nThe Breakfast Club star sat down with the Weekend at Bernie's actor in the documentary to discuss the fallout of David Blum's 1985 New York Magazine cover story that coined the term for a group of successful film stars in their early 20s. Along with Emilio and Andrew, the Brat Pack consisted of The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire alums Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy.\n\nAfter the article came out, the actors were often viewed as partiers and were not taken seriously in the film industry. Many of them went on to experience struggles with drug and alcohol addiction in the late '80s as a result.\n\nThough he agreed to discuss the Brat Pack with Andrew after years of avoiding the subject, Emilio said he is \"not interested in revisiting\" the past in depth. \"I think if you're too busy looking in your rear-view mirror, looking at what's behind you, you're going to stumble trying to move forward,\" he continued.\n\nWhen asked if he wished the Brat Pack name never existed, Emilio said, \"That's a difficult question to answer because you could only know the known. Was it something we benefited from? Maybe. But in the long run, I think we did not. I think there was more damage done by it than good.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elise_nelson@yahoo.com", "name": "Elise Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribeca Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mighty_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Mighty Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q..tu83YVogj.6pkWZXo.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/closer_weekly_341/e58077a5f675a7e418ec07e7592292d8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 610, "textEnd": 616}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 663, "textEnd": 670}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

In it, McCarthy, the star of '80s hits like \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"Pretty in Pink,\" tries to make peace with having been branded a member of the \"Brat Pack\" by the press.\n\nIn 1985, New York Magazine christened a collection of young actors with that sticky sobriquet -- itself a wink to the midcentury Rat Pack. The quasi-gonzo cover story by David Blum (who makes an appearance in the film) ran right before \"St. Elmo's Fire\" opened and a few months after \"The Breakfast Club\" hit multiplexes. Hollywood's youth quake was on. But not everyone reaped the benefits.\n\nEarly in the film, McCarthy says that the article \"affected my life massively.\" Over the next four decades, his filmography wasn't what he'd hoped for. Testing a theory that his fellow Brat Pack actors may have felt similarly pigeonholed, he phones Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe and others, whom he hasn't spoken to in decades.\n\nMcCarthy interviews them in person, sitting (or in the case of Estevez, standing) in what starts to resemble a therapy session. Often, McCarthy appears to be the only one who is still working through the trauma of instant, if fragile, icon status.\n\nThe film's through-line of woundedness is by turns touching, irritating and occasionally illuminating: A visit to the writer Malcolm Gladwell is insightful; watching Dick Cavett and Phil Donahue fawn offers a cringey lesson in how easy it is to rev the star-stoking machinery.\n\nAnd about that 1985 article: It doesn't actually mention McCarthy much. Though one of his co-stars had this to say about him: \"He plays all his roles with too much of the same intensity. I don't think he'll make it.\" If McCarthy's ire with the Brat Pack moniker begins to feel psychologically displaced, might this be the reason?\n\nBrats\n\nNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes.

Fox and Val Kilmer documentaries, but \"Brats\" turns Andrew McCarthy's near-40-year-old beef about \"the Brat Pack\" label into an exercise in self-indulgence, too heavily skewed toward his point of view. While it's fun seeing \"The Breakfast Club\" as they near \"The Early-Bird Dinner Club\" years, this is one of those projects that would have benefited from a more journalistic tone.\n\nThe origin of the term dates back to a New York magazine story with the headline \"Hollywood's Brat Pack,\" which lumped together stars of movies like \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"Pretty in Pink,\" playing off the \"Rat Pack\" nickname that defined Frank Sinatra and his celebrity pals.\n\nMcCarthy and his contemporaries, however, found the designation dismissive and insulting, underscored by rapid-fire video clips with news/\"Entertainment Tonight\" types throwing it around in the '80s, and the young actors fidgeting through questions about it from the likes of Phil Donahue, Charlie Rose and Merv Griffin.\n\nNow in their early 60s, McCarthy - having written a memoir, \"Brat: An '80s Story,\" about his experiences - transforms that into this ABC News documentary for Hulu, which is presented almost entirely looking over his shoulder. That includes an extended sequence of him on the phone trying to set up interviews with his contemporaries, which is every bit as scintillating as that sounds.\n\nA hit-miss collection of conversations follows, with some of the key players (Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson notable among them) taking a pass, while Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Lea Thompson, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer and Rob Lowe - some of whom question their own \"Brat Pack\" credentials - walk down memory lane, generally exhibiting less animus toward being \"branded\" that way than McCarthy appears to harbor.\n\nAs it happens, the most interesting exchanges come from third-party voices, such as authors Malcolm Gladwell and Bret Easton Ellis, which underscores that a sense of distance and perspective can be helpful in these situations, from noting how director John Hughes avoided issues of race to the significance of music in films of that era.\n\nAs the actors acknowledge, they benefited from a shift that saw Hollywood chasing their demographic, an emphasis on catering to youth that permeated TV as well as movies and persists to this day. Gladwell makes the astute case that such productions will never be quite the same as they were back then thanks to fragmentation brought about by streaming and an abundance of choices.\n\n\"We've gone from a relatively unified youth culture ... to everything's all over the place,\" Gladwell observes. \"There's no common denominator.\"\n\nMostly, \"Brats\" plays like a latter-day therapy session like the one the kids underwent in \"The Breakfast Club,\" only with the benefit of four decades of hindsight. It certainly feels like McCarthy seeks to build toward that by meeting with the writer of the article who coined \"Brat Pack,\" David Blum, who understands how the young actors might have seen it as dismissive or \"unjust,\" as Moore puts it, but doesn't apologize for something that amounted to a playful turn of phrase half a lifetime ago.\n\nAs noted, \"Brats\" joins a long list of confessional and/or nostalgic documentaries, with Soleil Moon Frye's \"Kid 90\" and Alex Winter's \"Showbiz Kids\" among other examples.\n\n\"We fit a niche that needed to be filled in pop culture at that moment,\" McCarthy says of himself and his peers back in their heyday.\n\nDon't look now, but \"Brats\" does much the same thing, filling a slightly different niche as streaming services look for ways to garner attention and distinguish themselves from the Subscription Pack.\n\n\"Brats\" premieres June 13 on Hulu.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

In an interview with Us Weekly, McCarthy shared insights into the making of the film and the dynamics of reaching out to former peers, including Molly Ringwald.\n\nRingwald, known for her significant roles in defining 1980s films, chose not to participate in the documentary, leaving McCarthy to rely on archived footage to include her perspective.\n\n\"She said she'd think about it and that was really the end of it,\" McCarthy recounted.\n\nRingwald's presence in the film is already significant through the archived footage, but McCarthy admits her absence is felt. (RELATED: 'The Breakfast Club' Star Admits Her Daughter Was Conceived In Studio 54 Green Room)\n\n\"She's so articulate and insightful about these things,\" he explained to Us Weekly. \"The Brat Pack's a funny thing. It's like an octopus -- it has these long tentacles you still reach out and you can either feel them as an embrace or as something [else]. People are at different places in their lives.\"\n\nThe term \"Brat Pack\" was coined in a 1985 New York Magazine article by David Blum and quickly became a double-edged sword for actors like Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer, Demi Moore, and Rob Lowe -- all of whom discussed in the documentary how the label both defined and confined their careers. McCarthy highlighted a shared feeling of isolation among the group due to public misinterpretation of their persona, US Weekly reported.\n\n\"We felt sort of, in a weird way, very alone in this thing because we interpreted it as one thing and the whole rest of the public interpreted it entirely differently,\" McCarthy told Us Weekly. \"That's all any of us ever want in life is to be seen, and we suddenly felt unseen in a certain way.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_54", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Studio 54"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1357785642-scaled-e1718237972672.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Moore, 61, spoke candidly about her \"beautiful\" experience working on the film with director Joel Schumacher.\n\n\"He really stuck his neck out for me because it's not like I had any box office draw; we were all just beginning,\" she recalled. \"They paid to have a sober companion with me 24/7 during the whole shooting. They could have easily found someone else.\"\n\nMoore, who has been candid about her past struggles with addiction, turned down \"going to treatment\" for St. Elmo's Fire.\n\n\"They said, 'Yes, what's more important: the movie or your life?' I said the movie,\" she explained. \"For me, I didn't have any value for myself. I think I was so fearful of failing, fearful of losing and desperate to fit in, belong and my need to please was definitely on high alert.\"\n\nMcCarthy, 61, spoke with Us Weekly exclusively about Brats ahead of its release and admitted he didn't really know what Moore was going through at the time.\n\n\"When you're in your early '20s, you're pretty self-absorbed.

The term first came about in a 1985 New York Magazine article written by journalist David Blum, who is also profiled in the film.\n\nMcCarthy speculated that the biggest \"surprise\" from Brats is the revelation that none of the Brat Pack members liked the moniker. In the doc, Moore remembered reading Blum's article and thinking, \"What the f -- k?\"\n\n\"[The term] definitely really irritated me. I felt like a sense of it being unjust.

Researchers say this \"bump\" can apply to experiences (a first kiss, a first dance), books, art, music -- which may explain why my Spotify most played list has many of the same tracks I was listening to on repeat in high school. And film is subject to this reminiscence bump too: The ones we see in adolescence have an indelible impact that doesn't fade as the years go by.\n\n\"The things that happen when you're young go deep,\" says Andrew McCarthy, narrating one scene in his compelling new ABC News documentary BRATS which premieres on Hulu this week. The movie's intention is to delve into the aftershocks that being snarkily christened the \"Brat Pack\" in a 1985 New York magazine cover story had on McCarthy and his fellow actors. What emerges is a heartfelt look back at films that not only defined a generation, but transcended it, and the enduring connection unwittingly shared by a group of poster children for young Hollywood in the '80s.\n\nThough the actors who make up the so-called pack have never been explicitly listed (and, in the documentary, it's a topic that's up for debate), most agree that the core members are Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe, Anthony Michael Hall, and Demi Moore. The group would overlap in a number of films: Pretty in Pink, St. Elmo's Fire, The Outsiders, Class, Sixteen Candles, Fresh Horses, and, perhaps most emblematic of the \"Pack\" spirit, The Breakfast Club.", "source": {"uri": "vogue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vogue.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6669bcbcd9db7b567dbe5819/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/MSDPRIN_PA007.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Seriously, I was so happy that McCarthy got to talk to the man who shifted his entire life in a way he couldn't have possibly predicted. The discussion is excellent when it comes to the complex dynamics that can sometimes arise between journalists and stars. McCarthy really gets to the core of what \"Brats\" is about in this interview, noting how Blum essentially took control of his career with what seems like a flippant nickname. As someone says earlier in the film, Martin Scorsese wouldn't call \"The Brat Pack,\" so the label became a stop sign for these performers, some of whom took years to shake it off, and some who arguably never did.\n\nMcCarthy's film consists primarily of conversations between McCarthy and former Brat Pack members like Estevez, Lowe, Sheedy, and Moore, some of whom he hasn't seen in decades. One of the most shocking elements of \"Brats\" for fans of these actors (and that era) may be how much it feels like the label broke up a band some hardcore fans would like to think is still running around a library on detention. Estevez says that a project with him and McCarthy immediately fell apart as every actor in this group fled the label to try to further their careers. Moore seems to have reached the best place about it all, putting it in a context that's downright moving regarding how much we tend to wallow in things we cannot change and how growth can only come when we stop.", "source": {"uri": "rogerebert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roger Ebert"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_tallerico@rogerebert.com", "name": "Brian Tallerico", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brats_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brats (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Scorsese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcore punk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/brats-documentary-film-review-2024/homepage_rebrats.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

McCarthy says he's reached out to Ringwald about participating. \"She said she'd think about it, but that she would probably just like to keep looking forward.\"\n\nCryer acknowledges that Ringwald wants to \"move on\" and \"taken without the baggage of our pop cultural references as an actor.\"\n\nMcCarthy, who directed the documentary, tries to reach out to Nelson, who is off the grid. He has to contact Nelson's manager to get his phone number. At the end of the documentary, McCarthy receives a call from Nelson, but it's unclear what they talked about.\n\nAhead of the documentary's premiere, Nelson spoke out about why he declined to appear in Brats. \"It seems strange to have that subject matter be something for edited entertainment,\" the actor to Us Weekly in March 2024. \"Also, like, he's a nice guy, but I hadn't seen him in 35 years.

The opposite is true when it comes to Hollywood's Brat Pack. The catchy moniker that came to define the '80s cineplex can be traced to June 10, 1985, when New York Magazine published a cover story pegged to the release of \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" The piece, written by David Blum, followed three of the film's stars -- Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe and Judd Nelson -- over several nights of heavy boozing and douchey antics, like ogling Playmates, encouraging groupies and trash-talking their rivals. Blum dubbed the group of young movie stars the \"Brat Pack,\" a phrase still recognizable four decades later.\n\nThe trio's \"St. Elmo's Fire\" co-star Andrew McCarthy remembers the exact moment when the film's producer, Lauren Shuler Donner, burst into an office on the Paramount lot waving a copy of the magazine. At first glance, he was disappointed that he had been cropped out of the cover image -- a publicity still from the movie, the shadow of his shoulder still visible. After poring over the 5,000-word piece, he was relieved by the omission: No good could come from being anointed a member of this A-list tribe of enfants terribles. But like it or not, he and the other stars of Joel Schumacher's coming-of-age drama about post-collegiate ennui -- including Estevez's fianc\u00e9e Demi Moore -- would soon be engulfed by the pop culture tsunami.\n\n\"We were in rehearsal for 'Pretty and Pink,' and I just remember sitting in that office going, 'Oh, fuck,'\" McCarthy recalls. \"It portrayed everybody as these frat boys who just wanted to party and get laid. Is it a good idea to take a journalist drinking with you? Probably not. I think everyone learned that lesson pretty quick.\"\n\nIndeed. On a sunny morning in late May, McCarthy is sipping iced tea at a caf\u00e9 inside the Museum of Modern Art. Wearing jeans and a button-down shirt, a pair of reading glasses perched atop his graying hair, he looks more like a prep-school teacher than the high school heartthrob who once wooed Molly Ringwald in \"Pretty in Pink\" and made teens girls across America swoon. He declines my offer to check out any of the museum's exhibits. \"Another day,\" he says, a note of impatience creeping into his voice. This location was chosen for convenience, being just blocks away from the Upper West Side apartment he shares with his wife, Irish writer and director Dolores Rice, and their two children, Willow and Rowan. (His older son from a previous marriage, Sam McCarthy, has followed in dad's footsteps, starring in the Netflix series \"Dead to Me.\")\n\nInstead, McCarthy is laser-focused on the topic at hand, revisiting the Hollywood era that spawned such teen-angst classics as \"The Outsiders,\" \"Class\" and \"The Breakfast Club.\" It's a subject he has ruminated on for years, resulting in the new documentary \"Brats,\" which he directed for ABC News Studios and Neon. The movie, which bows on Hulu on June 13, features Estevez, Lowe, Moore and others unpacking the pros and cons of the label, with McCarthy serving as a quasi-therapist helping them come to terms with the past.\n\n\"All these years later, 'Brat Pack' has become this wonderfully iconic phrase, looked upon through rose-colored glasses,\" says McCarthy, now 61. \"But at the time, it was very stigmatizing and affected all our careers adversely.\"\n\nABC News Studios head Mike Kelley wasn't sure what to expect when McCarthy walked into a Lincoln Center conference room in 2023 to pitch \"Brats\" to him and fellow executives David Sloan and Victoria Thompson. Sloan tried to lighten the mood by noting that he used to dress like McCarthy back in the day, when the movie star's rumpled blazers and open oxford shirts ushered in preppy chic. McCarthy told him that with \"Brats,\" he wasn't interested in merely cataloging his '80s star vehicles, like \"Mannequin,\" \"Less Than Zero\" or the \"Weekend at Bernie's\" franchise. Nor did he envision a cautionary tale, even though he and most of his co-stars confronted substance abuse issues after the spotlight dimmed. McCarthy, who has been sober since 1992 and carved out a lane as an in-demand TV director of such shows as \"Orange Is the New Black,\" \"The Blacklist\" and \"Gossip Girl\" in recent years, wanted to take a more sophisticated approach; his goal was to explore the double-edged sword of Brat Packdom and find out if any of his cohorts suffered similarly. The ABC team had just shepherded the Brooke Shields docuseries \"Pretty Baby\" to the screen and was looking for another project that could contextualize a societal inflection point. Kelley committed on the spot.\n\n\"I thought the idea of bringing audiences back to those nostalgic moments and then to have them reflect on how it affected these actors' lives was a really powerful prospect,\" says Kelley. \"To go back in time for that nostalgia but then to reflect on it in the present is a really effective way to pull on people's emotions.\"\n\nMcCarthy hadn't connected with any of his fellow Brat Packers in more than 30 years, with the exception of Moore, whom he ran into once when one of her daughters auditioned for a pilot he was directing. The last time he saw Estevez was at the \"St. Elmo's Fire\" premiere. He was finally ready to look back.\n\nFor those who came of age after the Brat Pack reign, there's no close approximation. New York Magazine dubbed Leonardo DiCaprio and friends Tobey Maguire and Lukas Haas the Pussy Posse in a 1998 cover story. The nickname didn't stick for obvious reasons. More recent times saw the birth of the tentpole Chrises (Pratt, Pine, Evans and Hemsworth), but they never captured the zeitgeist as a unit. The Brat Pack era coincided with the greed-is-good chapter in American history, when Madonna's \"Material Girl\" ruled the airwaves and teens obsessed over class distinctions. Movies like \"Class\" and \"Pretty in Pink\" reflected that sensibility, with McCarthy playing both ends of the economic spectrum in the two films. Most important to studio executives, these small-bet movies made money (think \"Breakfast Club's $1 million budget vs. its $52 million box-office haul).\n\nUnlike Brat Pack nepo babies like Robert Downey Jr., Estevez and Timothy Hutton, McCarthy made his inroads the old-fashioned way. As an NYU freshman, he saw an ad in Backstage for an open call for a movie. The ad said, \"Wanted: 18, vulnerable and sensitive.\" \"So I went up to the Ansonia Hotel on 73rd Street. I waited with 500 other 18-year-old vulnerable and sensitive kids out in the hallway for hours,\" he remembers.\n\nCasting director David Rubin, who later became the head of the Academy, handed McCarthy the script to \"Class,\" a comedy-drama about an underprivileged boarding school student who has an affair with the mother of his wealthy roommate (Lowe). \"Sixty scenes: I read them, and 10 auditions later, I was doing love scenes with Jacqueline Bisset. It was like winning the lottery,\" he says.\n\nThe film also mirrored the misogyny of the times. In a 2013 interview, Virginia Madsen, who had a small role in the film, said, \"Those guys were assholes\" of her \"Class\" cast mates that also included an up-and-coming John Cusack. McCarthy doesn't disagree. \"It was unfortunate because there's certainly no intimacy coordinator on set back then, but it's also a scene about a girl's top getting ripped open and her breast comes out, and the boys are supposed to react like stupid 15 year olds on camera. I mean, that was the scene,\" he says. \"Of course that's going to be humiliating, and I'm sure it was not handled sensitively. And then you have to do that X amount of times. Of course it's going to be a horrific. But when she was in 'Sideways,' she was so lovely in that, and matured into this really lovely being, and I was like, 'Good on you. Fucking A. Look at you.'\"\n\nDespite that now-cringeworthy scene, the film ended up earning more than three times its $7 million budget, and suddenly the genre was red-hot. \"Class\" paved the way for \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" the Brat Pack movie that put the spotlight on the group's excesses. Moore, fresh out of rehab, was trailed by a sobriety coach 24/7 on set. (\"There was always people hanging around her. I just thought it was an assistant,\" McCarthy says. \"All I knew is that she'd be coming [to set] and it was delicate.\") McCarthy was battling his own demon -- namely, vodka -- though he never drank during production. \"That film's vibe was kind of great, actually,\" he says. \"Certainly, no one was doing drugs or drinking on that set. People were there to work.\"\n\nThe Brat Pack era reached its zenith with the 1986 drama \"Pretty in Pink.\" Estevez's brother, Charlie Sheen, was supposed to play the film's rich hero, Blane. \"It was written for sort of a square-jawed, broad-shouldered quarterback type,\" McCarthy says. \"They gave me a courtesy audition because I'd just done 'St. Elmo's Fire.' And they go, 'No, he's totally wrong.' Molly read with me. And when I left, she said, 'That's the kind of guy I'd fall for. He's kind of dreamy and poetic, not some fucking jock.' And John Hughes said, 'That wimp?!' But to John's credit, what he did so well is he listened to young people. And he got on board with it and said, 'All right, you want him, you got him.'\"\n\nRingwald's endorsement didn't stop studio executives from suggesting that McCarthy enhance his physique. \"People used tell me I had to go to the gym all the time,\" he says. \"Like Arnold [Schwarzenegger] and Sly [Stallone] were everywhere. But if I was a bulked-up Blane, it would have been weird.\"\n\nThe original \"Pretty in Pink\" ending called for Blane to succumb to the pressures of the rich-bro code and dump Ringwald's Addie. \"I go to the prom with someone else, some extra,\" he adds. \"The test audience just fucking turned on the movie and hated it.\"\n\nSo the studio scrambled and called for reshoots. The only problem was, McCarthy had shaved his head for the Broadway play \"The Boys of Winter.\" \"So they made me a wig. And I remember it was just a really bad, cheap wig, and it looks like there's a bird's nest on my head,\" he says. \"I just walk up to Molly looking so forlorn with this thing on my head, and say, 'I love you.' But that movie was a fairytale. So you have to give the princess what she wants at the end.\"\n\nDitto for America's teens, who drove the $9 million film's $41 million in box-office receipts. Author Malcolm Gladwell notes in \"Brats\" that the '80s was the one era when audiences across the country were unified and teen concerns mattered. Today, attention spans are fractured, no one watches or discusses the same thing, and teen-led content, from \"Euphoria\" to \"13 Reasons Why,\" is aimed at adults, being too dark for kids.\n\nIn fact, the Brat Pack train began to derail when the studios opted for dark but couldn't quite pull it off. The arrival of 1987's \"Less Than Zero\" was meant to herald an edgier version of the genre. Based on Bret Easton Ellis' book about L.A.'s drug-addled upper-class teens, the final product proved to be significantly neutered, even if the set itself was a bacchanal.\n\n\"On 'Less Than Zero,' there were a lot of drugs happening, and that just was not a secret. It was the '80s, and that's what people did,\" McCarthy says. \"But it was also right when Nancy Reagan's 'Just Say No' campaign came out, and suddenly we had to reshoot 35% of the movie and have kids flushing cocaine down the toilet. Like, who ever has flushed cocaine down the toilet? If you've got to get rid of cocaine, you just snort it all up. The studio executives were like, 'Not having that.' And so the film had to have a message: 'Drugs are bad.'\"\n\nFor Downey Jr., who plays the film's spiraling antagonist, life was beginning to imitate life. \"Bobby's a really sweet guy, and he was going through his own self-immolation. He would just come in, do a bunch of push-ups before a scene to get out of breath. That was his process,\" McCarthy notes. \"'St. Elmo's Fire' was a joyful experience and a bright experience. 'Less Than Zero' was a very dark experience.\" Downey Jr. later acknowledged that for the first time in his career, he was using during production on \"Less Than Zero,\" sending him on a decade-long freefall that landed him in jail for six months in the late-'90s before he got sober. Critics, audiences and Ellis himself rejected the film, though Ellis, who appears in \"Brats,\" says that he eventually warmed up to the film.\n\n\"Brats\" hits at a time when '80s nostalgia is cresting. A Broadway musical based on \"The Outsiders\" nabbed 12 Tony nominations in April. Anticipation is mounting for the fifth and final season of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\" There's talk of rebooting \"St. Elmo's Fire\" as a TV series. And a new generation is discovering Brat Pack films like \"The Breakfast Club,\" which is now in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry.\n\nShuler Donner points to the perseverance of McCarthy and his \"St. Elmo's\" castmates and notes that maybe the New York Magazine story got them all wrong. \"I know these guys felt attacked by that piece,\" she says. \"They were 20 years old, and of course they're gonna party. But they were very serious and accomplished actors. I believe that the reporter was jealous. Over time, they all proved their mettle.\"\n\nFor decades, McCarthy refused to watch any of the films from that period. But as he began interviewing the old gang for \"Brats,\" he found comfort in knowing that he wasn't alone in how he processed the era. Though Ringwald and Nelson passed on being interviewed on camera, Moore was the first to say yes. Then Lowe made the time, as did Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Jon Cryer. McCarthy even tracked down Blum, the man who handicapped their fledgling careers by inventing the phrase and ensuring that Hollywood wouldn't take them seriously for years to come.\n\n\"The biggest surprise for me doing the movie was how much affection we all still have for each other,\" says McCarthy. \"We had this identification with the Brat Pack.

I didn't do a movie because of it,\" Estevez told McCarthy in the documentary. \"This was Young Men With Unlimited Capital, which was one of the best scripts I had read in a long time.\"\n\nMcCarthy admitted he was also asked to do Young Men With Unlimited Capital, but learnt that The Mighty Ducks actor \"didn't want\" him to participate in the film.\n\n\"I didn't want to have anything to do with any of us. Do you know what I mean?\" Estevez reassured him. \"I just didn't want to do any movies. If it were Judd, I would have said the same thing.\n\n\"To be seen again in another film would ultimately and could potentially have a negative impact. Working together just almost felt like we were kryptonite to each other.\"\n\nThough he agreed to discuss the Brat Pack with McCarthy, Estevez added that he was \"not interested in revisiting\" the period in depth. \"I think if you're too busy looking in your rear-view mirror, looking at what's behind you, you're going to stumble trying to move forward,\" he continued.\n\nWhen asked if he wished the Brat Pack name never existed, Estevez said: \"That's a difficult question to answer because you could only know the known. Was it something we benefited from? Maybe. But in the long run, I think we did not. I think there was more damage done by it than good.\"\n\nEstevez's comments mirror those of Ally Sheedy in a 2020 interview with The Independent's Adam White.\n\nSheedy told White that the women connected to the quartet by proxy of being in movies with them were sullied by association. \"The ladies weren't there! I think he got one particular angle when the truth is that the guys would hang out a bit, but we weren't hanging out as one big group. We weren't young actors running around town spending all our time together. I thought it was a little gossipy and undermining, and I didn't know that it was going to stick the way that it did.

Here are some of its most interesting moments.\n\nIn the documentary \"Brats,\" Andrew McCarthy attempts to come to terms with being part of the Brat Pack, the group of young actors who were ascendant in '80s movies. Turns out, many of them didn't like the nickname, or the association. \"I lost control of the narrative of my career overnight,\" McCarthy said of the period after the writer David Blum coined the immediately catchy term, in a 1985 New York Magazine profile of Emilio Estevez.\n\nHe and other actors, like Estevez and Rob Lowe, who had been frequently cast together in ensemble coming-of-age dramedies (\"St. Elmo's Fire\"), scattered, fearful that appearing together would be a career liability. In the documentary, streaming on Hulu, McCarthy, an actor, director and travel writer, checks in, after many years of absence, to see how they processed this pop culture twist.\n\nSome -- like Demi Moore, a \"St. Elmo's\" co-star -- handled it all a lot better than others.\n\nIn a phone interview from his Manhattan home, McCarthy, 61, said his impulse was not nostalgia -- though he knows that's what might draw an audience -- but an excavation of how time and memory collide with youthful expectations.\n\nIt was a leap: He walked around New York and cold-called Brat Packers he hadn't seen in decades, with a camera crew trailing. \"I thought, if anyone calls me back, I have a movie,\" he said.\n\nPrompted by McCarthy's low-key, conversational style, Moore, Lowe, Estevez and others turned up; Judd Nelson and Molly Ringwald did not. In kitchen table and couch-side interviews that also serve as a kind of celebrity home tour -- Ally Sheedy's Upper West Side apartment ranks as the most relatable -- the movie cracks the time capsule of the Brat Pack's appeal.

Depicted in the piece as out-of-control, party-hearty twits, they loudly objected to what they considered to be writer David Blum's shallow, sensationalistic treatment. \"That was ridiculous, and at the time I was very angry about it,\" Emilio Estevez said in early 1987. \"He painted us in a very negative light. He didn't portray us as hard-working young men and women who cared deeply about our craft.\"\n\nNearly 40 years later, a member of the Brat Pack is looking back on those times and wondering what they meant. Andrew McCarthy's documentary \"Brats,\" which just premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, brings together several of his fellow club-members to reminisce and reconsider, provoking fresh waves of cultural nostalgia for this gang of photogenic young actors who were both mocked and loved in the '80s.\n\nAlthough different actors have been placed in the Brat Pack over the years -- whether they liked it or not -- there are eight performers who are generally considered officially part of the group: Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy, Anthony Michael Hall, Demi Moore, Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Rob Lowe. But which of their movies from the Reagan era have stood the test of time? And which are outright embarrassments?\n\nTo answer those questions, I've put together a ranked list of Brat Pack movies, the rule being that at least two of the official members had to star in them. Of the 12 films that made the cut, I'd say only five would be classified as \"good,\" with many of them actually pretty terrible. Graying Gen-xers may think I'm being too harsh, to which I'd say many of these actors went on to better work after the '80s -- perhaps not surprisingly, once they stopped appearing in movies together. But from love stories to crime dramas to teen sagas, these were the films that defined their meteoric rise -- even if more than a few of these pictures, I'm sure, they'd love to forget.\n\nVincent Canby had little patience for \"Class,\" writing in his New York Times review, \"The movie can't make up its mind whether it's a lighthearted comedy ... or a romantic drama about a teenage boy who has a torrid affair with his roommate's mother. Either way it's pretty awful.\" It's hard to argue: The film starred McCarthy as a sheltered newbie at a prep school, with Lowe as his cool-guy roommate and Jacqueline Bisset as Lowe's mom, who McCarthy starts sleeping with. (Hilarity, allegedly, ensues once McCarthy discovers who her son is.) Bisset later expressed misgivings about the film, saying, \"[T]hey changed my character's behavior, making me look like a bimbo, out in the streets and trying to get laid,\" and especially with modern eyes, \"Class\" feels like a misguided attempt to capitalize on the sex-comedy trend popularized at the time by the gross \"Porky's.\" Neither Lowe nor McCarthy feel entirely comfortable in their roles -- better days were on the horizon for both.", "source": {"uri": "rogerebert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roger Ebert"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_grierson@rogerebert.com", "name": "Tim Grierson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribeca Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Canby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Canby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Bisset", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacqueline Bisset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/uploads/blog_post/primary_image/features/the-brat-pack-movies-ranked/homepage_MixCollage-12-Jun-2024-07-26-PM-2574.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

That's flattering, but not really true. What happened was, I destroyed the Brat Pack. The Brat Pack was left for dead on the night I named them in 1985.\n\nI didn't set out that evening with premeditated murder in mind, just excitement over the possibility of a cover story. I was 29 years old and restless for success in my new job at New York Magazine when young actors Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, and Rob Lowe agreed to join me for dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe, presumably so confident in their capacity to charm that they neglected to notice my murder weapon: a notebook and pen. While the St. Elmo's Fire stars amused themselves for hours by repeatedly toasting \"na zdorovye!\" with vodka shots, shamelessly flirting with an endless parade of eager women, and boldly cutting lines at nearby after-hours nightclubs, I quietly scribbled what I saw. It didn't take long to land on a line that would perfectly capture the narrative I'd stumbled on -- a story vastly more interesting than the one I'd set out to write. Here was Hollywood's Brat Pack.\n\nI'd originally pitched my editors on a story about Estevez, a lead in the new teen movie The Breakfast Club and a budding movie director at the time, and I went to Los Angeles with that angle in mind. But after a Monday night out, and several days trailing Estevez around Los Angeles, I had a notebook bulging with examples of bratty behavior: Estevez worming his way into an empty movie theater for free, trash-talking actors like Andrew McCarthy, asking me to follow him in his car and then gunning his engine to 90 miles an hour through the hills of Malibu. It wasn't the profile I'd intended to write, but I felt certain the young 1980s stars I'd grouped together in Estevez's crew would easily survive a headline. If anything, a good lawyer would get my sentence reduced to involuntary manslaughter.\n\nNearly four decades later, actor, writer and director Andrew McCarthy has released a Hulu documentary all about the agony inflicted on this era of Hollywood up-and-comers by my two words. Naturally, it's called Brats. In truth, I still don't understand why some Brat Packers feel so victimized. My headline paid homage to a beloved Hollywood institution known as the \"Rat Pack\" -- a phrase invented by Lauren Bacall to describe several drunk actors, including Frank Sinatra, David Niven, and her husband, Humphrey Bogart. I applied the term to several actors I hadn't even met or interviewed; I was aware, for example, that the notion of a \"pack\" first formed on the set of Taps in early 1981, involving that hunks-in-uniform movie's three leading men: Sean Penn, Tim Hutton, and Tom Cruise. For Hutton, the added pressure of already winning an Academy Award at the age of 19 (as the troubled kid in Ordinary People) made it an especially stressful shoot, and mandated regular goof-off sessions.\n\nThis much had already been documented in \"The Angry-Young-Manhood of Timothy Hutton,\" a cover story published in May of 1984 in Moviegoer magazine, in which veteran Hollywood journalist Gregg Kilday writes: \"Hutton spends much of his free time with other actors and actresses his own age. His friends include Tom Cruise [and] Sean Penn .... the group, says Hutton, offers its members an escape from the constant pressure of their burgeoning careers; by mutual agreement, they avoid talking about their work.\" It seemed to me fair game to include Cruise, Penn, and Hutton in my story, along with actors Matt Dillon and Nicolas Cage. Looking back now, I realize I must have deemed the Brat Pack an all-male club -- but history has correctly reconfigured the group to include Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, and Molly Ringwald. And some actors have simply decided they were in the Brat Pack, even though they never appeared in my story, hung out at the Hard Rock, behaved brattily or even lived in Los Angeles.\n\nI figured my cover story -- with \"Hollywood's Brat Pack\" splashed above a publicity still from St. Elmo's Fire that fortuitously caught Estevez, Nelson, and Lowe in a bar, grinning and hoisting brewskis -- would likely annoy these young stars for a few days, and perhaps cause some brief agita among Hollywood publicists who tend to want to control the stories that come out about their clients. Nothing prepared me for the firestorm of attention that resulted. It managed a mention in nearly every St. Elmo's Fire-related story that year; I saw the phrase inserted in dozens of headlines, profiles and reviews. Johnny Carson name-checked the Brat Pack in his monologue.\n\nBut I didn't hear from anyone directly and still assumed that whatever problems I might have created would blow over. I learned much later that the Brat Pack's agents and publicists had immediately ordered their clients to avoid one another at all costs -- no more Hard Rock burgers, no more na zdorovye! and especially no more ensemble movies. After a couple of weeks of silence, an exhausted, defeated Emilio finally called me at home. I heard his voice in my answering machine, and quickly picked up, naively hoping he was calling to forgive me. It didn't go quite that way.\n\n\"What the hell were you thinking?\" Emilio asked, plaintively.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I replied, honestly enough. After a long beat of silence, I added, \"I'm really sorry.\"\n\nI wasn't, though. And even after he hung up, I felt certain he'd realize that the phrase would be forgotten. He would have his still-ascending career, and I would have mine. But as all too often happens, the actors' public responses to my story only served to add fuel to the fire. Lowe and Nelson lashed out at me repeatedly in interviews, \"David Blum burned a lot of bridges,\" Lowe seethed to the Chicago Sun-Times. \"He burned people early in their careers. He took on the wrong people, though. He's not Hunter Thompson or Tom Wolfe; he's David Blum living in a cheap flat.\" (I did indeed rent a two-bedroom Upper West Side apartment near an express stop for only $1,500.)\n\nPenn piled on. \"All it is, is a condescending load of shit written by some person with a big vibrator up his ass,\" the Fast Times at Ridgemont High star said dismissively in an American Film interview. \"Sometimes writers, like actors, like anybody, do their work to impress three or four of their cool friends in Soho.\" (For the record, I only had two cool friends in Soho, and they weren't the least bit impressed.)\n\nDespite this tongue-lashing, I still maintain my story didn't change anyone's career trajectory. Sure, in the ensuing decades some members of the Brat Pack would subsequently fail to reach the starry heights they'd dreamed of when they first got famous. Was that my fault? It certainly seemed so to less successful members, who have watched the phrase live on for almost 40 years. In 2017, Judd Nelson told Bret Easton Ellis on his podcast that \"I should have punched him out when it happened.\" Ahead of the premiere of Brats at the Tribeca Film Festival last week, where I appeared on a post-screening panel with McCarthy, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy and Jon Cryer, a friend texted me wise words: \"The distance from Judd Nelson to John Wilkes Booth may not be that far.\"\n\nBut the fact that a Brat Pack documentary even exists in 2024 -- let alone deserves a Times Square billboard, a glittering red-carpet premiere and an after-party -- demonstrates the lasting and emotionally resonant hold this group of actors had on the culture, then and now. McCarthy's cleverly edited film, even while purporting to portray the Brat Pack as put-upon by the phrase, manages to smooth over the fact that no real animus exists anymore between the Brat Pack actors and me. At the end of our interview, McCarthy and I even hugged it out, sitcom style. At the Brats premiere, Demi Moore introduced herself to me, and clasped my hands in hers as though greeting an old friend.\n\nIn truth, the Brat Pack has been ingrained as a happy memory for a generation of moviegoers who came of age in the 1980s, learning life lessons from the likes of directors John Hughes, Francis Ford Coppola, Cameron Crowe, Paul Brickman, Joel Schumacher and Amy Heckerling. They're avatars of a once-vibrant celebrity culture that minted movie stars to last a lifetime, not a year or two. The epic, enduring star power of Brat Packers like Cruise, Lowe, and Penn -- with Robert Downey Jr. and Matthew Broderick right there with them -- have kept the Brat Pack brand alive and well. They've racked up a remarkable record of durability in an industry that now casts actors aside on a daily basis.\n\nIt struck me as an odd omission that the Brat Pack's current careers and successes don't even earn a mention in McCarthy's Brats. Maybe all their success contradicts McCarthy's thesis that the Brat Pack moniker mortally wounded everyone in its path. \"You're called a brat!\" McCarthy whines to Demi Moore, who correctly pushes back by asking, \"Why did we take it as something bad?\"", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We were certainly privileged. But there wasn't anything great about us. We were just in the right place at the right time and represented that seismic change in pop culture. You're easy prey when you're exposed in that way.\"\n\nStill, the Brat Pack has become a permanent fixture in nostalgia for the 1980s -- and changed the movie industry forever. \"Suddenly Hollywood realized kids go to the movies way more than adults,\" McCarthy explained. \"We've been inundated with movies for young people ever since, but before that, movies were not for the young.\"\n\nAmong those movies were plenty of popular coming-of-age films like Sixteen Candles and The Outsiders. And just like there's no official list of Brat Pack members, there's no official list of Brat Pack movies -- but 12 feature at least two of the group in them. Ahead, read all about the Brat Pack's movies.\n\nIf you've ever heard the phrase \"Stay golden, Ponyboy,\" then you definitely know something about The Outsiders. When it debuted in 1983, the movie introduced the world to a new generation of A-list actors like Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze and Matt Dillon. Based on the 1967 novel by S.E. Hinton, the film was directed by Frances Ford Coppola and centered on teenagers of different socioeconomic statuses clashing in 1965 Tulsa. The Outsiders featured Lowe in his first feature film role (as Sodapop) and Estevez in one of his earliest roles (as Two-Bit).\n\nRelated: The Outsiders Cast: Where Are They Now?\n\nMcCarthy's first feature film appearance was a starring role in 1983's Class, which was also Cusack's film debut and Lowe's second film. In the movie, McCarthy's \"Jonathan\" is new to a posh private school, where Lowe's \"Skip\" is his roommate. After a bumpy start, they become fast friends -- until McCarthy becomes involved with an older woman and the relationship threatens everything.\n\nThe film that introduced the world to Jake Ryan, Sixteen Candles, premiered in 1984 and was John Hughes' directorial debut. The movie features Molly Ringwald as Sam, who's navigating life as a teenager, surviving high school and turning 16 as her extended family descends on her house for her sister's wedding. When they do, they forget her birthday -- but one very important boy doesn't. Anthony Michael Hall plays The Geek, who has an unrequited crush on Sam, and John and Joan Cusack have small roles.\n\nA less memorable entry into the Brat Pack canon, 1984's Oxford Blues starred Lowe as a lovesick teenager trying to woo the object of his affection, the British Lady Victoria Wingate. He follows her to England, enrolls in Oxford, meets Rona (played by Ally Sheedy) and, as expected, hijinks ensue. A young Cary Elwes also appears in one of his earliest roles, just a few years before The Princess Bride.\n\nOne of the most iconic 1980s movies, The Breakfast Club had an almost all-Brat Pack cast. In the John Hughes classic, five high school students from different social groups -- \"a brain, an athlete, a basketcase, a princess and a criminal\" -- have all-day Saturday detention, and are tasked with writing essays that day with the topic \"who you think you are.\" What they find out is that the five of them, who seem extremely different at the outset, have a lot more common ground than they realized.\n\nThe 1985 film stars Ringwald as Claire, the popular, preppy girl; Estevez as Andy, the jock wrestler; Sheedy as Allison, the reclusive weirdo; Hall as Brian, the brainy nerd; and Judd Nelson as Bender, the rebellious outcast.\n\n\"The movie has this message that in spite of people's differences, there is something unifying in the experience of growing up and trying to find yourself,\" Sheedy told PEOPLE in 2015.\n\nThe same year, another of the seminal Brat Pack films debuted: 1985's St. Elmo's Fire. The film, set in Washington D.C., follows a group of friends who have recently graduated from Georgetown University as they hang out at their favorite watering hole, St. Elmo's Bar, and try to navigate adult life for the first time. Alec (Nelson) is a politico who's in a relationship with Leslie (Sheedy); he's pressuring her to get married, but she suspects he's unfaithful. Kevin (McCarthy) is an aspiring writer who's secretly in love with Leslie. Kirby (Estevez) is hopelessly obsessed with Dale (Andie MacDowell), and takes a questionable job to impress her. Jules (Demi Moore) is wealthy but troubled by her absent parents. Party boy Billy (Lowe) dropped out from partying too much, and is now reluctantly married with a baby and struggling to meet his responsibilities. Sheltered good girl Wendy (Mare Winningham) is longing for independence and is endlessly helping Billy because of her unrequited crush on him.\n\nOf his role as Billy, Lowe told PEOPLE, \"I became so identified with it -- the wild, fun, rock and roll, quasi-debauched with the heart of gold [guy]: that's my early twenties in a nutshell.\"\n\nIn it, Andie (Ringwald) is an artsy, offbeat teenager who's keeping her underemployed dad afloat by working at a record store. Her best friend Duckie (Jon Cryer) is a loveable weirdo desperately in love with her -- but she's enamored with one of the \"richies\" in high school, Blane (Andrew McCarthy). They try to date, but are pulled apart by their friends: Duckie is adamantly against Blane, questioning his intentions; Blane's best friend Steff (James Spader) sows resentment against Andie because he's burned by her rejection of him. They finally reconnect at the prom, where Andie has repurposed an out-of-date prom dress into her own creation, and the sparks fly.\n\nAnother rare box office flop for the Brat Pack was the 1986 thriller Blue City, starring Nelson as Billy, who has returned to his Florida hometown to discover that his father was mysteriously killed. In seeking revenge, Billy reconnects with his best friend Joey and Joey's sister Annie (Sheedy). After traumatic losses, Billy and Annie escape together.\n\nIn this steamy 1986 comedy-drama, Lowe and Moore play Dan and Debbie, who are figuring out their first serious relationship together. They meet at a softball game, have an immediate connection and spend the night together. After a conversation \"about last night,\" they decide to keep seeing each other, but things inevitably get complicated despite their strong feelings for each other.\n\nTalking to Good Morning America in January 2024, Moore opened up about the impact of the \"Brat Pack\" moniker on her and her costar. \"For Rob, it kind of just slid off his back,\" she said. \"For me, I didn't love it, being thought of as a brat because I thought it kind of diminished us as professionals.\"\n\n\"It's really interesting cause you know, the Brat Pack moniker that came about really didn't have anything to do with us as people, as professionals,\" she added. \"It was just a clever headline.\"\n\nThis 1986 crime drama, written and directed by Estevez, is the actor's filmmaking debut. He plays John Wisdom, who was convicted of grand theft auto and, struggling to find a job, feels detached from society. He and his girlfriend Karen, played by Moore, go on a Robin Hood-style crime spree -- but instead of stealing money, they break into banks to erase records and give struggling people relief from their debts.\n\nIn this 1988 film, McCarthy stars as Matt, a college student who meets Jewel (Ringwald) by chance and tries to help her out of desperate circumstances. Jewel is a teenager in an abusive marriage, who married only to escape her abusive stepfather -- but despite his feelings for her, Matt can only do so much to help. Fresh Horses also features Ben Stiller and Viggo Mortensen in some of their earliest film roles.\n\nReleased in 1990, Betsy's Wedding is generally considered the final Brat Pack movie. In it, Ringwald plays Betsy, who's engaged to be married to Jake (played by Dylan Walsh), a man from a much wealthier family. In order to impress his future in-laws, Betsy's father Eddie (Alan Alda, who wrote and directed the film) gets himself in way over his head financially, and resorts to some unsavory characters to pay the bills. Sheedy plays Betsy's sister Connie.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(filmmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Hughes (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Candles_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "16 Candles (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowe's", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lowe's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andie_MacDowell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andie MacDowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._E._Hinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

He has many accomplishments as an actor but there's this one thing he finds hard to shake: Back in 1985, he got called something.\n\nDuring the Reagan administration, rising star Andrew McCarthy was lumped into an amorphous group of young actors who were changing Hollywood. They were called the \"Brat Pack.\"\n\nNow, it's never nice to be called a \"brat\" or to lose your individuality to a pack, but McCarthy and the members of this collective -- Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe and maybe Anthony Michael Hall -- seemed to implode.\n\n\"That changed my life,\" says McCarthy, who starred in \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" After being branded, the so-called bratty actors scattered, not wanting to work together again. The stigma, McCarthy says, was \"defining.\" He has PTSD, he suggests.\n\nAfter smallest Saturday crowd in decades, Cardinals attendance lows piling up Missouri teacher 'wouldn't recommend' OnlyFans career, says she's a 'total outcast' Kansas City home built by Whitey Herzog is for sale, complete with bat banister Mothers allege Kirkwood Schools withheld yearbook sex survey records St. Louis Public Schools asks teachers to drive buses this fall 2 truths and an underlying question: Revealing trends in Cardinals' riveting loss to Bucs Teen driver gets 4 months in deaths of 3 Lincoln County teens.

Francis Howell schools scrap video platform over claims it pushes 'social agendas' McClellan: Today's politics are a slow-motion trainwreck BenFred: There goes the Cardinals' momentum again. Here's why it keeps happening. Renovated Kirkwood home includes rentable outdoor oasis\n\nNow almost 40 years later, McCarthy hit the road to star in and direct his new Hulu documentary, \"Brats,\" trying to get a handle on the label and how some of the pack handled it.\n\nFirst stop is a wary Estevez, who acknowledges that the Brat Pack term had some early benefits but was ultimately \"more damage than good.\"\n\n\"It created the perception that we were lightweights,\" he adds.\n\nThen there are visits to Sheedy, Moore, Lowe, Jon Cryer, Tim Hutton and Lea Thompson -- all who commiserate with McCarthy. (Ringwald and Nelson are notable absences, perhaps still nursing wounds.) These visits have the feeling of therapy sessions.\n\n\"Marty Scorsese, Steven Spielberg is not going to call up somebody who's in the Brat Pack,\" McCarthy tells Estevez, who admits to pulling out of a movie at the prospect of teaming up with McCarthy.\n\n(Not to be rude, but the Brat Pack-adjacent Tom Cruise did a movie with Scorsese, \"The Color of Money,\" Moore became the hottest thing in Hollywood in the '90s and Robert Downey Jr., also Pack-adjacent, just took home an Oscar.)\n\nAs he pays one former colleague after another a visit at their well-appointed homes, the heat of injustice has dissipated. Moore's estate with its tasteful wood panels, shaded pool, massive glass walls and Japanese-inspired minimalism doesn't exactly scream, \"That label from 1985 really destroyed my life.\"\n\nThe doc is scored well, with songs by The Cure, Lou Reed and Steve Winwood, \"Forever Young\" by Alphaville and a haunting \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" cover by Zoe Fox and the Rocket Clocks.\n\nBut McCarthy's visual style is too fragmented, happy to capture his scrambling camera and sound operators in the frame and changing up his shots from guerilla-style jerky iPhone images to tasteful, polished portraits. His use of old clips is excellent, incorporating not just scenes from movies but TV interview outtakes, too.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Where He Is Now", "body": "Emilio comes from a famous family with his dad, Hollywood star Martin Sheen, and brother Charlie Sheen. He was born on May 12, 1962, and made his screen debut in the TV movie To Climb a Mountain in 1982. One year later, he nabbed the role of Two-Bit Matthews in the classic film The Outsiders.\n\nAfter The Outsiders, Emilio became the unofficial leader of the Brat Pack after his role in The Breakfast Club. He starred as the popular jock, Andrew Clark, alongside fellow teen stars Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall. As the '80s petered out, several members of the Brat Pack saw their careers close to drying up as they became too old for the coming-of-age dramas that made them so popular. However, Emilio went on to star in 1992's The Mighty Ducks.\n\nIn the early '80s, Emilio dated actress Mimi Rogers, and was involved on-and-off with model Carey Salley, whom he fathered a son and daughter with. He famously dated and subsequently proposed to fellow Brat Pack member Demi Moore in 1995, but Demi called off the wedding once she learned Emilio had been unfaithful. The same year Disney introduced the world to The Mighty Ducks, Emilio married singer Paula Abdul. Unfortunately, their relationship ended just two years later.\n\nThe Brat Pack was a term coined by a 1985 New York Magazine article about some of the hottest teen stars at the time. Emilio, Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald, Demi Moor, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall and Andrew McCarthy all became associated with the nickname and never managed to shed the label.\n\nEmilio Estevez's Feelings on the Brat Pack\n\nThe Loaded Weapon 1 actor has never been especially excited to be known as a member of the Brat Pack over the years. Much of his annoyance with the label comes from people's inability to not question him about his time in the popular teen group.\n\n\"That [term] will be on my tombstone,\" Emilio told The Guardian in an interview published on January 10, 2020. \"It's annoying because Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon have worked together more than any of us have. We just made two movies and somehow it morphed into something else.\"\n\nIn Andrew's Brats, the Pretty in Pink star stops by to visit Emilio and get his thoughts on the label and how it attached itself to him and his costars for years. Emilio believed that the Brat Pack had some advantages early on, but said it \"ultimately it did more harm than good.\"\n\n\"It created the perception that we were lightweights,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "whitney_danhauer@yahoo.com", "name": "Whitney Danhauer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mighty_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mighty Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Sheen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Sheen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Abdul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paula Abdul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimi_Rogers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mimi Rogers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming of age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Damon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television_and_Movies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television and Movies", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7KJSUCmcvvR8rD5KTPQFyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/closer_weekly_341/99261f2de3ab0f99433f89297362a6b5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-10", "textStart": 1939, "textEnd": 1955}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-05-", "textStart": 119, "textEnd": 125}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Nelson starred alongside Ringwald in The Breakfast Club and appeared with more Brat Packers in St. Elmo's Fire.\n\nMore from this section\n\nJudge Scolds Claim In Madonna's Late Concert Legal Battle - #Shorts\n\nThe Best FPS Games To Play in 2024\n\nFlavor Flav In Red Lobster Ad After Vowing To Help Bankrupt Chain", "source": {"uri": "mycouriertribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Courier-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "avery_thompson@mycouriertribune.com", "name": "Avery Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelson (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hit song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pretty in Pink (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor_Flav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flavor Flav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo's_Fire_(Man_in_Motion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Breakfast", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Breakfast", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo_Queens", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo Queens", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/mycouriertribune.com/content/tncms/custom/image/1a7338c4-e7f0-11e6-b11a-f71a45eda02e.png?resize=600%2C125", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Joined by his sons -- John Owen, 29, and Matthew, 30 -- his family teamed up with Ancestry to discover all the different genetic similarities they share.\n\n\"We were actually in the same building where Robert Downey Jr. and I had eighth-grade history together,\" Lowe tells PEOPLE. \"So I was trying to figure out what seat each of us were sitting in.\"\n\n\"Then we went to the auditorium. Beautiful,\" he continues. \"I was overwhelmed with how amazing this auditorium still is. It was probably built in 1930, so it's that kind of construction that we did in those days that was significant and amazing.\"\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nThere's also a special feature behind the curtains in the beautifully constructed space. \"Backstage, apparently, everybody wrote their names -- the names of all the actors that had performed there,\" he explains.\n\n\"Now, in high school, I wouldn't lower myself to be a part of a high school production because I was a professional, don't you know?\" the actor laughs. \"So, I didn't have that experience, but when I went back, the first name I saw written on the back wall was Emilio Estevez.\"\n\nLowe says that going back \"was unbelievable.\"\n\n\"In particular, because my boys were there, but also because the nostalgia of it,\" he shares. \"I haven't set foot there in 40-plus years. I've not, I haven't been there since I left to shoot the [1983] movie The Outsiders.\"\n\nThe father of two isn't the only one who has been looking back. Lowe appears in the Hulu documentary BRATS, directed by his St. Elmo's Fire costar Andrew McCarthy. The film looks back at the height of the Brat Pack -- a group of young actors that ruled Hollywood in the 1980s -- as well as the aftermath for the group and its adjacent cohorts.\n\nTo Lowe, it's \"really, really cool\" to see fans' dedication to that time in their lives, many years and projects later.\n\n\"To be a part of something that has the staying power is something. The fact that people are still interested, remember, love the Brat Pack is really, really cool. What was fun about that and what I think is fun about the documentary and fun about talking to Andrew, is how differently we all perceived being a part of that phenomenon. Some people really struggled with it,\" he says.\n\nThese days, the actor says he keeps in touch with a few people from the time. \"I see Demi [Moore] around. She's the one I see most at events or out in the world. She and I talk.\"\n\n\"Andrew did a movie with my son a couple of years ago. He actually played his father, so he connected with Andrew and that was fun,\" he continues. \"And it was fun in the documentary to hear from Emilio and Andie MacDowell. They even got Tim Hutton in there. It's definitely worth the price of admission.\"\n\nLowe says he's looking forward to seeing audience reactions to the documentary, since he admits, \"I'm the worst person to ask. There are five people in the world who are in the Brat Pack, so we're like the last people to ask about what we thought about it.\"\n\nHe continues, \"My takeaway is just how sweet it all is. To look at those relationships and the movies that we got to make together ... it would be like if they did a documentary about your sorority or fraternity, right?\"\n\n\"There's all the feels that you would get from it. That is what I get from this Brat Pack documentary.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nLowe also had some feels when learning about the similarities between himself and his sons following their DNA tests.\n\n\"One of the features learned we share is about being ambitious and competitive. When I was in those hallways, I knew what I wanted to do and was actively working on being an actor,\" he says.\n\n\"Most people in high school haven't even really thought about what they want to do yet. My younger son has always kind of known what he wanted to do. My older son hasn't necessarily known what he wanted to do, but has always been such a hard worker. Those things were borne out in the Ancestry DNA test.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Puzzler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People Puzzler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1:_Lone_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "9-1-1: Lone Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Downey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstage_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backstage (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Monica High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crossword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Monica, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Monica, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Outsiders (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andie_MacDowell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andie MacDowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Hutton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Hutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web_Columns", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web Columns", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/Fv7FJ_-fh-4qUMxoDbGF0cCDyr8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(742x128:744x130)/rob-lowe-high-school-061024-4b2d96bc86a14f1b960b7ca8bce47fc8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

It's like reliving my adolescence", "body": "(CNN) -- When I watch the trailer for Andrew McCarthy's new documentary, \"Brats,\" my pulse races as if I'm watching old home movies of myself and my friends.\n\nI'm not a Hollywood star -- ahem! -- and I don't know anyone in the film, but I have frantically searched the Internet for more on the movie, which revisits a group of young actors -- principally Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Anthony Michael Hall and McCarthy himself -- who came to be known in the 1980s as the \"Brat Pack.\"\n\nThese former stars made movies during one of the most pivotal periods in my life, when I left behind my childhood, entered the fraught universe of my teen years and became aware that boys were interesting. Maybe a little too interesting.\n\nMcCarthy's documentary, which premieres today on Hulu, explores the lives today of actors who starred in such films as \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Sixteen Candles,\" \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"Pretty in Pink.\" The film is not about my life, but judging from the trailer it's full of my memories and music.\n\nOn its surface, \"Brats\" is about the stars we '80s kids lived and died by (and how they didn't like the \"Brat Pack\" label). On a deeper level it also appears to be about the passage of time, the vagaries of fate and the way labels can loom large enough to change lives.\n\nWhen the Brat Pack movies came out, I was a Long Island girl, on the cusp of my teen years. The youngest of four daughters, I woke up each day to my clock radio playing Top 40 or New Wave. I read \"Seventeen\" magazine religiously and frequented the mall, where I could watch coming attractions of new movies -- including previews of R-rated films forbidden by my Catholic mother.\n\nThe first movie I saw to star some of the Brat Packers was 1983's \"The Outsiders,\" the drama about rival youth gangs in early-'60s Oklahoma. It's not strictly considered a Brat Pack movie, but it features Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez, two charter members of the club. My oldest sister, Tricia, loved it, So I did, too.\n\nI was too young to watch it right away but I read the book a dozen times to match the number of times Tricia saw the movie. I still have my dog-eared paperback of the S.E. Hinton classic, and the faded cover is torn just below the image of actor C. Thomas Howell.\n\nThe movie was set in a different era far from my Long Island town, and featured terms like \"greasers\" that meant nothing to me. But it had the same teenage angst I was feeling, and some of the hottest actors I'd ever seen. During a sleepover at a friend's house, we rewound the videocassette on the VCR countless times trying to catch the unscripted moment when Lowe's towel almost falls off after he's taken a shower. Lowe was older and even better-looking -- if that's possible -- two years later in \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" where he played a recent college grad.\n\nWhat made these movies so alluring to me was one simple fact: The characters -- high school students, college students and even young professionals -- showed me a world I hadn't yet fully entered. It was the world of my older sisters, and as any little girl will tell you, that's the world that matters the most.\n\nLike many younger siblings, I experience nostalgia not just for my own childhood and adolescence but for the many events I experienced vicariously through my sisters. Whatever films or actors or musicians caught my sisters' attention inevitably captured mine.\n\nThe movie that most captured the attention of my sister, Denise, was \"Pretty in Pink.\" Just like the Molly Ringwald character, Denise loved to shop for vintage clothing. She and I would take the Long Island Railroad into New York City, visiting shops like Canal Jean Co. and Antique Boutique in Greenwich Village where we'd skim the racks of 1940s men's suit jackets and vintage jeans. We pored over magazine spreads that showed the looks from these films and tried to emulate them.\n\nWhen I asked Denise recently about the movie, she recalled seeing it over and over in the theater, not only because she thought Ringwald was \"the coolest\" but also because back in that pre-Netflix era, teens went out to the movies. That may partly explain why these movies loom so large for me.\n\n\"Going to the movies was the big thing to do every Friday and Saturday night,\" Denise said.\n\nWe listened to her cassette tape of the \"Pretty in Pink\" soundtrack on repeat in our house and I can remember blaring the movie's big hit, \"If You Leave,\" by OMD, at high volume. Its heartache sentiments might strike some people as sappy, but for me it still conjures the feeling of falling hard for someone.\n\nI soaked it all in, and in a scrapbook I made during high school, I pasted pictures from magazines of the bands I liked, including New Order, INXS and the Psychedelic Furs, who recorded \"Pretty in Pink's\" title song.\n\nI also was enchanted by Demi Moore's smart-mouthed character, Jules, in \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" who delivered snarky comments with a smoky, world-weary voice. That was the kind of woman I wanted to become (although the scenes of her meltdown after she locked herself in her apartment didn't reflect my naturally upbeat personality but then again, I wasn't dealing with my \"stepmonster's funeral.\")\n\nThe Brat Packers became unwitting role models for me. This was partly because some of the movies were written and directed by John Hughes, who in the mid-1980s portrayed young adult life in a way that was much more realistic than ABC after-school specials or TV shows like \"The Brady Bunch.\" Film critic Roger Ebert once called Hughes \"the philosopher of adolescence.\"\n\nHughes' characters spoke our language and got our visual cues. In one scene in \"Sixteen Candles,\" a poster of the band Culture Club hangs on the wall. It resonated with me because my sister, Liz, was crazy about Boy George. In \"The Breakfast Club,\" Hughes explored how a popular girl like Claire, played by Ringwald, would be seen as more important than other students and how even someone as outwardly rebellious as Judd Nelson's character, John Bender, would feel stung by the implicit pecking order.\n\nAs the Brat Pack era dawned, I was attending a public school where I didn't care for the industrious kids in my Honors class but was too bookish for the popular crowd. In my sophomore year, I transferred to a Catholic high school that I loved partly because doing well academically didn't isolate you socially. The president of the Honor Society was also the cutest guy in the school.\n\nBut it was in a far wealthier town than my own, and some of the preppy kids were rich and obnoxious like James Spader's character in \"Pretty in Pink.\"\n\nSoon after transferring, I tapped a perfectly thin, perfectly attired blonde on the shoulder in math class to ask her a question. I'd noticed that her uniform skirt fit her perfectly and clung to her sinewy frame while mine was loose, bulky and unflattering. Her family must have paid a seamstress to trim the skirt. She turned around, took one look at my hair-sprayed bangs -- I hadn't yet adopted the preppy bob that was popular at the school -- and then turned away without saying a word. I was beneath her.\n\nToday, some 40 years later, I can say some of the Brat Pack films hold up better than others. \"The Breakfast Club,\" for example, is deservedly in the National Film Registry, which recognizes movies of cultural significance.\n\nBut the performances and scenes in \"St. Elmo's Fire\" now strike me as trite. (Remember Rob Lowe's sax-playing character climbing out on the roof?) And of course, \"Sixteen Candles,\" despite some tender and hilarious moments, was sexist and racist. The one non-White character was an Asian exchange student, Long Duk Dong, a crude stereotype played for laughs. And the character played by Anthony Michael Hall is encouraged to have sex with a girl who is passed-out drunk.\n\nBut what does hold up is the films' music.\n\nThe song that closes out \"The Breakfast Club\" -- Simple Minds' \"Don't You Forget About Me\" -- remains an iconic embodiment of the raucous feelings of that era of my life. It plays as Judd Nelson's troubled rebel walks away from the school, fist defiantly raised, a moment after Ringwald's princess character has placed in his hand one of her diamond earrings.\n\nThe mismatched classmates have formed an unlikely bond, and we're all swooning. I could sleep for a thousand years and would still wake up knowing the words: \"As you walk on by, will you call my name?\"\n\nSoundtracks from the MTV era help these movies transcend moments that have aged poorly, and my own penchant for nostalgia helps when even the music falters. John Parr's \"Man in Motion\" from \"St. Elmo's Fire\" is cheesy, but in its over-the-top earnestness I can still feel my breathless excitement over the film and its actors.\n\nAs McCarthy wrote in a 2021 memoir that gave rise to his documentary, \"It's not just the work; maybe now more importantly, it is the memory of the work that's so valuable to people.\" The movies came out for all of us '80s kids \"when the future was a blank slate, when anything was possible.\"\n\nNow he has made a documentary that I have no choice but to watch because he's investigated not only his distant past but a part of mine, too.\n\nI can't wait to see what he found out about a moment we shared through the silver screen and what it all meant -- if it really mattered. Actually, forget that last part. It definitely mattered.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Blum ran the Brat Pack profile that changed the lives of McCarthy, Estevez, Lowe, Nelson, Demi Moore, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy forever.\n\nDuring \"Brats,\" McCarthy, who wrote, directed, and stars in the project, went to see Blum at his hotel room to hash things out decades later.\n\n\"If you had told me 10, 20, 30 years ago I'd be walking out to see David Blum's apartment, the writer of the Brat Pack article, I'd say you're f-king crazy,' \" McCarthy said just before the sit-down.\n\nBlum told the \"Pretty in Pink\" actor how he never meant for the Brat Pack article to come off negative.\n\n\"I didn't dislike any of them -- I thought they were all quite nice,\" Blum said. \"It's hard to explain, but I didn't think at the time, 'Ugh, these brats.' At all.\"\n\nHe also revealed how he came up with the Brat Pack title: the night before the dinner, he was out with other journalists, and one of them referred to the group as the \"fat pack.\" That joke \"reemerged\" in Blum's head before he went out with Estevez and company.\n\n\"It didn't cross my mind really that it was all that big a deal,\" Blum told McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy, still bothered about the situation, asked Blum if he thought the Brat Pack title was \"scathing.\"\n\n\"I guess in retrospect, yes. At the time, no,\" said Blum. \"I was proud of my creation of the phrase. Look, I was 29. I definitely knew it was gonna have a reaction.\"\n\nMcCarthy explained: \"My recollection was that it was instantaneous and burned deep. i just remember seeing that cover and going, 'What just happened.' I felt instantly that I had lost control of the narrative of my career.\"\n\nThe \"Weekend at Bernie's\" star continued: \"What really upset me about the article was that it felt like they're not that interested in doing the craft of it. They want to be famous and party. I took offense at that. It felt like to me, and I know to the other people at the time, that we have to reposition this or deflect this or get away from this. Because it certainly wasn't perceived in the industry as a compliment.\"\n\nBlum said that in hindsight he feels \"more redeemed than ever by the fact that I was not wrong.\"\n\nBut McCarthy called out Blum for not writing the article \"with any affection\" towards the group.\n\n\"You were all adults,\" Blum pointed out. \"I would not have written that story about minors.\"\n\n\"There were a couple things in the article that were plain old not nice, and I should've been scolded by somebody,\" Blum added. \"And I was. I was just trying to be funny. I hope I won't sound too arrogant by thinking that I might have succeeded.\"\n\nBlum said that while his life didn't change as much as he thought it would after the Brat Pack article came out, he's still \"proud\" of the piece and doesn't regret publishing it.\n\n\"You're 29. That's when you make mistakes,\" he said. \"Even if it was a mistake, I still don't think it was, you've gotta take chances and just swing and do crazy things.\"\n\nAs they said goodbye, McCarthy asked Blum if he could have been nicer in the article.\n\n\"It's collateral damage in my view to making the point,\" Blum answered. \"Here was a bunch of people that had become very famous and popular.\"\n\n\"Sticks and stones,\" Blum added.\n\nMcCarthy addressed his sit-down conversation with Blum in an interview with Decider.\n\n\"We all tell ourselves what we have to tell ourselves so we can live with ourselves. I think his perspective as writing this magazine piece as a young man was to make a splash and get the next job,\" said McCarthy. \"This was a heyday of snark journalism, and New York magazine was at the forefront of it. He wasn't thinking about his subjects. I think he ultimately came down on 'I know this wasn't cool, but I stand by it.'\"\n\nMcCarthy also mentioned that he had to \"actively restrain\" himself from talking back to Blum.\n\n\"But I didn't want to do to him what he did to us. Really, I just wanted to get his take. At the end, when I asked if he could have been nicer, he simply said 'sticks and stones.' A callous remark, but I let him speak for himself,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Blum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelson (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Michael_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Michael Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demi Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Organizations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Fiction", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Non-Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Non-Fiction", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/83735066.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

And if not, well, why not?\n\nThe movie, airing on Hulu, is a strange but worthy watch: cringey here, unexpectedly revelatory there, sincere and blinkered and articulate and dumb. McCarthy, now 61, is a slightly more wizened and concentrated version of his teenage self, his pale blue eyes still searching for reassurance. The cameras follow him with at times uncomfortable frankness as he dials up Emilio Estevez and Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe and Jon Cryer, and asks them if he can come over and chat. I know many of us think these people all hang out at the same country club, but the truth is that McCarthy hasn't seen most of them in 30 years. So, yes, he's that guy, too, calling long-ago friends out of the blue to talk over the bad old days.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ty_burr@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Ty Burr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brat Pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teen film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_Sheedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ally Sheedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molly Ringwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Estevez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Estevez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cryer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cryer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judd Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Lowe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FFR5XJS3QNEONPRNKXZSJAN2FA.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646925", "eventUri": "eng-9646925", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

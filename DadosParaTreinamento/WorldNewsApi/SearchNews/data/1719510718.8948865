Submit it here. Dear Care and Feeding, I loved being a mom and have always looked forward to being a grandmother. For years, I\u2019ve told my kids, who are now in their 30s, that I can\u2019t wait, and that once they have kids I\u2019d be happy to help with child care. My son and his wife had a son four months ago and asked me to do bridge care between her maternity leave and her summer vacation (she\u2019s a teacher). But she is incredibly particular about her son\u2019s care, and as a first-time mom she\u2019s way too anxious about the small stuff. She\u2019s too hard to work with, and my own daughter and son also sided with her about all kinds of parenting decisions\u2014and my daughter doesn\u2019t even have kids! Now that summer vacation is here, I have put a blanket ban on all grandma childcare. My daughter, who just announced her pregnancy, is furious. My son is mad because he and his wife apparently had been planning for once-weekly daycare with me without ever having asked! How do I get everyone to calm down? \u2014Grandma, Not Personalized Nanny Dear Grandma, A student of mine, in a long-ago undergraduate creative writing workshop, used to say, \u201cThis is a WW moment\u201d\u2014her own coinage, which I never forgot and made liberal use of myself in the years following. WW stands for \u201cWait\u2014what?\u201d and it\u2019s invoked whenever a character in a story says or does something that contradicts what\u2019s been established by the writer. That\u2019s what I thought when I read your question. Wait\u2014what? You told your kids for years that they could count on you for child care\u2014that you were so looking forward to grandparenthood, you couldn\u2019t wait!\u2014and now that the grandchildren have started appearing, you\u2019ve announced that you have no intention on following through. And you\u2019re so self-righteous about it! Your daughter-in-law is too particular about her baby\u2019s care! Your own kids take her side in \u201cparenting decisions\u201d (how dare they, when you\u2019re the one who knows how things should be done)! Listen, Grandma, I don\u2019t know why you imagined that the grandbabies you dreamed about would be yours to care for as you wished and that you would get to overrule their parents if you disagreed with them, but grandmothering isn\u2019t mothering. You absolutely have the right to refuse to help out with your grandchildren, current or future. You have the right to renege on a promise (which you should never have made). But you don\u2019t get to demand that your children \u201ccalm down.\u201d If you\u2019re interested in repairing your relationships with them after this debacle, consider being honest with them: Tell them you should not have promised to help with child care. Tell them you had no idea what that might actually entail. And if you search your soul and discover that, somewhere deep inside, you know that it\u2019s the children\u2019s parents who are in charge of how they\u2019re cared for\u2014and that you can live with that\u2014you might offer to try again. If not, your role in your grandchildren\u2019s lives will be that of the loving visitor. There is no shame in that. But you won\u2019t even have that if you don\u2019t own up to your mistake.

Dear Care and Feeding, I have two boys, ages 8 and 12, who play one sport a season. We have local family\u2014on my side, my mom and her husband (who typically have my children sleep over once a month); on my husband\u2019s side, his sister and her husband, whose mother-in-law lives with them, and who have no children (so they also have my children spend the night once a month). All of these people used to come to a game a couple of times a season, which was fine. But they\u2019ve all started coming to EVERY game, and it\u2019s too much for me and my husband. Five people to entertain is a lot when I just want to watch my sons play! And my sister-in-law talks my ear off, so I can\u2019t enjoy the game. But even beyond that, because we have to entertain/socialize with them, we are not getting to know other families in our community, which is very important to us. It seems to me they see more than enough of my kids. They each get 24 uninterrupted hours per month with my boys, plus family holidays and birthdays. How do I set things up so we can go back to them only coming to one or two games each season without hurting their feelings? I tried leaving one weekend off the schedule I shared with them, and then just as they were leaving the week before it, they said, \u201cNo games next weekend?\u201d and my kids said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re playing!\u201d I just wanted some peace and quiet! Help! \u2014Too Much Talking on the Sidelines Dear Too Much, Well, I\u2019ve got to say, right at the outset, that an awful lot of people will read this letter and think, OMG, I\u2019d give anything if anyone in my extended family had any interest in coming to my kids\u2019 games! Nobody cares! It\u2019s just us, week after week, alone in the stands. I mention this not because I don\u2019t think you have a problem\u2014you do, I can see that. Anything that troubles anyone is by definition a problem. (It\u2019s like the answer to the question of what makes a plant a weed: A weed is anything that grows where you don\u2019t want it to.) I mention this because I think it\u2019s important to have perspective. Even as I offer you advice about how to solve this problem, I do want to point out that, while vexing, it is also an excellent problem to have: too much love and interest. I get that the grandparents and aunts and uncles are horning in on something you want to keep just for you. I also get that, to you, 24 uninterrupted hours every month, plus holiday gatherings, seems like plenty of time with your kids. Apparently, it\u2019s not to them. This disconnect can be solved only by an honest conversation. To avoid hurting them (or at least to soften the blow\u2014because it will feel like a blow to them), make it clear that you are glad and grateful that they care so much, that they want to be so involved, and that your children are lucky enough to have adults in their lives other than their parents whom they can count on. (Take a moment, please, to be glad and grateful and not just be saying it.) But as happy as you are about that, tell them, you need time to spend as a family on your own, too\u2014and as a family among the other families in your community. Tell them you consider the kids\u2019 games special time for you. Then let them know how many games they\u2019re welcome to attend. Let them plan for those games (you decide whether you\u2019re willing to have all five of them at once, once or twice a season, or whether you\u2019d prefer to have your mother and her husband pick one game and your sister-in-law and her family pick another). If they pout or argue, stand your ground, but with kindness and love. You get to make the rules. (But they\u2019re not rules if you keep your wishes to yourself and only think of them as rules. So speak up.) Catch Up on Care and Feeding \u00b7 Missed earlier columns this week? Read them here.\u00b7 Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group! Dear Care and Feeding, My 14-year-old daughter, \u201cMelissa,\u201d has two very close friends, and no other friends. She is equally close to both of them; she doesn\u2019t prefer one over the other. But her two friends do not get along. This is not because anything happened between them, but because they both have a need to be Melissa\u2019s only and absolute best friend (despite the fact that both of them have lots of friends other than my daughter). Melissa\u2019s friends will frequently tell her malicious lies about each other in an attempt to be her \u201cbest\u201d or only friend, making her feel that she has to pick a side. She\u2019s getting to the point where she doesn\u2019t want to be friends with either of them anymore. I don\u2019t know what advice to give her. \u2014Can\u2019t Pick a Side Dear Pick a Side, Here\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering: Why doesn\u2019t Melissa have any other friends? If you ask her and she says she doesn\u2019t like anyone else\u2014or tells you no one else likes her\u2014wouldn\u2019t it be worth pursuing why this is? You seem to know a lot about the dynamics of this friendship triangle, which suggests that your daughter is comfortable talking to you about it. I\u2019d ask a lot more questions. If all three of these kids were close, I wouldn\u2019t be so concerned. (I remember being in an \u201cus-against-the-world\u201d trio in junior high.) If the other two girls didn\u2019t have plenty of other friends and only Melissa is otherwise friendless, ditto. But this particular dynamic\u2014your daughter in the middle as two people fight over which one \u201cgets\u201d her\u2014raises questions for me. Is there something about this dynamic that she secretly likes? It seems to me that several things are going to have to happen for this push-and-pull to end. Melissa needs to understand her role in this. She needs to have frank conversations with both of her close friends about it. And she needs to make an effort to expand her social circle, just as her two best friends have already done. Dear Care and Feeding, In the next month, my husband and I have to decide whether to keep our daughter in her daycare or move her to a school-based preschool. The decision feels impossible. The daycare\u2019s administration has been a mess (lots of teacher turnover), but it\u2019s safe and convenient, our daughter has made great friends there, and\u2014crucially\u2014it closes only on federal holidays (which has been a godsend, because we don\u2019t have family nearby who could help out with school breaks while we\u2019re working). The school-based preschool is rated off the charts. Every teacher there has a master\u2019s degree in early child education. Friends who send their kids there describe it as \u201ca magical place.\u201d We were shocked when we managed to lottery in. But it closes for Christmas break, spring break, several weeks in the summer, etc. Many of the families whose kids are there have a stay-at-home parent, so this isn\u2019t a problem for them them, but it would require real sacrifice and organization on our part (alternating our vacation time, competing for slots in the rare summer camps that accommodate four-year-olds, etc.). If it weren\u2019t for the many breaks, this wouldn\u2019t even be a competition; the school would be an easy choice. But I\u2019m worried that we can\u2019t pull off the juggling. Can we? How do parents do this? \u2014Either Option Sounds Good, Right? Dear Sounds Good, Question: What are you going to do when she\u2019s 5 and starts school? I ask because you\u2019re going to have to be doing this juggling then. Parents who have full-time jobs handle this in a variety of ways (and often, in any one family, in a combination of ways). After-school programs, vacation childcare programs, part-time babysitters, parent co-ops, shifting to work with more flexible hours when possible, and, yes, alternating vacation time (not an inclusive list!) are all ways of balancing child care and work. If you already have a plan in place for next year, and the school-based preschool is that appealing, put the future plan in place now. If you have not begun to make a plan for next year, well, you need to start. Because this problem is not going to magically solve itself once your kid\u2019s in school. It\u2019s not easy to figure out how to handle work and child care\u2014no question about it. And as a society we\u2019ve failed miserably in this area. That it\u2019s every parent for themselves struggling to find a way to solve this problem is unfair, unreasonable, and infuriating. But one way or another, you\u2019re going to have to find your own solution. If the thought of doing so now fills you with dread, then, sure, put it off a year. It sounds like the daycare is a good enough place to keep your child parked until kindergarten. As long as she\u2019s safe and happy, don\u2019t feel as if you have no choice but to make the switch. But don\u2019t kid yourself, the juggling act eventually comes for us all. \u2014Michelle More Advice From Slate When I married my husband about a decade ago, he was a widower with a 13-year-old son, \u201cToby.\u201d Toby was extremely precocious and intelligent, and my husband, raising him alone, quickly grew frustrated with the level of his math instruction at school. Having the means to do so, he had Toby educated at home by private tutors.

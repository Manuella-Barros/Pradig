It had Aditya Roy Kapur in it. It's fine\u2026It's fine.\u201d She said, \u201cAisa pehli baar ni hua hai. Yeh pehle bhi bahut hua hai. [This hasn't happened for the first time. This has happened a lot before]. I started my career at a very young age. So, I have seen rejections. But it has never really been a thing. I mean, of course, if you really want to play a character and it doesn't work out, you feel a bit sad. But you know life goes on and something better comes along. I truly honestly believe in that. Every time, something has not worked for me, something even better has happened. So, now I really don't look at it as a setback and a failure. I just know something better is coming and it always has.\u201d The Night Manager is the Hindi remake of the British series of the same name.

When asked to name an actor who was easiest to work with, Jennifer said, \u201cNo definitely, Karan Wahi. I mean, we worked fourteen years ago. And honestly, we were just talking the other day because you know we have each other on the set\u2026we are the first ones to come in and the last ones to go. But because of the bond we have, because of the friendship we have, it has actually been a cakewalk. At least for me.

Hotel employees have been fired since the incident, and police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell's death, Milwaukee police said in a statement to CNN at the time. A homicide investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"This 43-year-old male was restrained by four people after being combative in the hotel lobby,\" an investigation report from the medical examiner's office states. \"He reportedly went unresponsive while staff awaited police arrival. Illicit drug paraphernalia was found on his person. The decedent was conveyed to this office for an autopsy.\"\n\nThe encounter unfolded as the use of force - particularly against people of color - by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after protests flared nationwide following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nIn a statement, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Mitchell family, said the findings from the medical examiner's report \"demand immediate charges against the officers involved.\"\n\nMitchell's mother believes he was suffering from a mental health episode, and cell phone video footage corroborates accounts of witnesses who reported seeing \"three to four security guards with their knees on Mitchell's neck and back and one of them striking him in the head with an object.\"\n\n\"Mitchell was in the midst of a mental health crisis and, instead of abiding by their duty to protect and serve, the security officers and other Hyatt staff used excessive force that inflicted injury resulting in death,\" the statement continued. \"We will not rest until we achieve justice for Mitchell and his grieving family.\"\n\nNew details emerge about what happened\n\nAccording to the medical examiner's investigation report, Mitchell \"entered the lobby of the Hyatt Regency Hotel and appeared to be frantic and panting.\n\n\"He was noted by staff and hotel guests hiding behind various objects throughout the lobby. He tried to hide in the concession area but was told to leave by hotel staff,\" the report states.\n\nMitchell \"ran into the women's restroom and attempted to lock himself inside with other females using the restroom,\" the report continued. \"The women inside began to scream, so two hotel security staff gained entry into the restroom and removed Dvontaye. He reportedly became combative with security and attempted to reach into their pockets. Security personnel struggled to subdue him and began to physically drag him out of the hotel through the front entrance.\"\n\nTwo other hotel employees assisted the two security personnel once Mitchell was outside, the report states. \"He was still combative, so all four employees held him down on the concrete face down until MPD arrived,\" the report says. \"It was unknown at this time where the hotel staff restrained Dvontaye and to what extent.\"\n\nPart of a video posted on social media shows security guards and others pinning Mitchell to the ground. Mitchell grunts and pleads with the guards, repeatedly saying, \"Please,\" and \"I'm sorry,\" the video shows.\n\nOne of the guards, who appears to be White, can be heard saying, \"Stay down,\" and \"Stop fighting,\" as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \"This is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\"\n\nWhen officers arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures, Milwaukee police have said, without mentioning Mitchell by name.\n\nMitchell was punched, dragged out of hotel onto sidewalk, video footage shows\n\nDuring a Friday evening news conference, Mitchell family attorney William Sulton painted a different picture from the medical examiner's report, playing several more videos from the incident, including security camera footage that revealed for the first time a view from inside the Hyatt as employees were removing Mitchell from the building.\n\nThe footage shows Mitchell being dragged across the floor inside the lobby, and from another angle outside that shows employees holding him down on the ground.\n\n\"The first time I saw it, I couldn't even get it out of my mind ... I've never forgotten what this looks like, and now that it's made public, I have to make sure that my daughter doesn't see it,\" Mitchell's widow, DeAsia Harmon, said at the news conference. \"This is somebody I spent 12 years of my life with and now I have to watch his life being taken for nothing.\"\n\nThe Mitchell's family attorney claims he had been shown these new videos by the Milwaukee District Attorney's Office, but the office didn't provide copies of the videos to him. They were obtained after Sulton subpoenaed the medical examiner's office, he says.\n\nCNN has contacted the Milwaukee Police Department for comment on the videos.\n\nAt the beginning of the news conference, Sulton showed photos of injuries Mitchell suffered to his head, which had been repeatedly slammed to the ground during the encounter, he said. In the photos, Mitchell's eyes are swollen, red and purple, and his face bloodied.\n\n\"So, when you hear people say, 'oh, all we did was hold him down, all I did was do what I was being told' - none of that is true. They slammed his head into the ground multiple times, pressed his head into the ground. This is the photographic proof of that,\" the family's attorney said.\n\nSulton continued to play the security camera videos at the news conference, and at one moment pointed at a man wearing a red shirt who he identified as a guest of the Hyatt hotel, along with another man in a black shirt, who he said is an off-duty security officer.\n\n\"You can see they're dragging Mr. Mitchell behind,\" Sulton said. \"At no time, will you see Mr. Mitchell punching anyone, kicking anyone. In fact, it's apparent he's just trying to get up.\"\n\nThe video showed the Hyatt guest forcibly pulling Mitchell out of glass doors in the entrance of the hotel building. Mitchell is seen in the video struggling with his clothing falling off while the hotel guest pulls his clothing to drag him out of the doors, before the security officer approaches them again, along with another woman employee who then picks up a broomstick and appears to strike Mitchell in the leg.\n\nSeconds before that, the security officer is seen putting his hand out to stop his woman co-worker from hitting Mitchell.\n\nThe video then shows Mitchell's pants falling down as a man punches Mitchell in the face multiple times, while he's being dragged on the floor and then outside on the sidewalk by the Hyatt guest, the two Hyatt employees and an additional employee.\n\nAnother video from a security camera pointing at the sidewalk shows two additional Hyatt employees approach the group, one of whom appears to hit Mitchell with a walkie-talkie and kick him in the face while Mitchell remains on the ground.\n\nSulton said all four Hyatt employees had the ability \"to simply wait for police to show up if that's what they feel is necessary. They don't do that.\" The attorney said the security officer \"waved over\" the two additional employees outside, even though they are a desk agent and bellhop with \"no legal right to detain him or arrest him or to engage in any of this behavior.\"\n\n\"This is just a straight-up beat down,\" he said, adding the security agent should have intervened and had ample opportunities to do so, but instead contributed to Mitchell's pain. Mitchell also suffered broken ribs, said the attorney. \"This is how he got them,\" he continued.\n\nCompany says several people were fired\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the hotel management company that operates the Hyatt Regency in downtown Milwaukee, said \"several associates\" were fired after the incident.\n\n\"The conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\" the company said in a June statement.\n\n\"Following review of their actions, their employment has been terminated,\" the statement said. \"We will continue our independent investigation and do everything we can to support law enforcement with their investigation into this tragic incident.\"\n\nCNN's Alisha Ebrahimji, Ray Sanchez and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create

(AP) -- Prosecutors charged four Milwaukee hotel employees Tuesday with being a party to felony murder in connection with D'Vontaye Mitchell's death.\n\nMitchell was Black. The incident has drawn comparisons to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died in 2020 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd's death sparked a national reckoning on race relations marked by multiple protests around the country.\n\nCharged were hotel security guard Todd Erickson; front desk worker Devin Johnson-Carson; bellhop Herbert Williamson; and security guard Brandon Turner. If convicted, they each would face up to 15 years and nine months in prison.\n\nReached by telephone Tuesday evening, Erickson referred a request for comment to his attorney, Michael Steinle, who didn't return voicemail or email messages.\n\nIt was unclear if any of the other three employees had attorneys. Online court records didn't list any for them Tuesday evening. A telephone listing for Williamson had been disconnected, and The Associated Press could not immediately locate phone numbers or other contact information for Johnson-Carson or Turner.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said in a news release that arrest warrants had been issued for all four employees. The office and the Milwaukee Police Department did not immediately respond to emails inquiring if the employees had been arrested or had attorneys.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, the four employees dragged Mitchell out of the Hyatt Hotel on June 30 after Mitchell entered a woman's bathroom and held him on his stomach for eight or nine minutes. One of the employees told investigators that Mitchell was having trouble breathing and repeatedly pleaded for help, according to the complaint.\n\nAn autopsy showed that Mitchell suffered from morbid obesity and had ingested cocaine and methamphetamine, the complaint said.\n\nHyatt surveillance video shows Mitchell frantically running into the hotel's lobby and then into the gift shop before entering the women's bathroom, the complaint said. A few seconds later, a woman emerges and Turner, who was off-duty but happened to be visiting staff at that moment, drags Mitchell out of the bathroom into the lobby by his shirt.\n\nThe two begin to struggle, and Turner punches Mitchell, knocking him to the floor. He then punches Mitchell six times and drags him out of the hotel with the help of a bystander. Mitchell gets up and tries to go back inside.\n\nWilliamson, Johnson-Carson and Erickson, who was on duty as the security manager, then join the fray. Together with Turner they hold Mitchell down on his stomach for eight to nine minutes before police and emergency responders arrive. The video shows that during that span, Mitchell tries to break free multiple times, and Erickson hits him with a baton before he eventually stops moving, according to the complaint.\n\nA video taken by a witness includes audio of Mitchell moaning and saying he is sorry. An autopsy found that Mitchell was morbidly obese and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.\n\nThe county medical examiner ultimately determined that Mitchell died of \"restraint asphyxia.\" He may have lived if the employees allowed him to turn onto his side, the medical examiner said, according to the complaint.\n\nErickson told investigators that Mitchell was very strong and kept resisting them and tried to bite him. But the guard said he never did anything to intentionally hurt or harm Mitchell.\n\nTurner told a detective that said that he heard women screaming in the bathroom after Mitchell entered it, and he thought Mitchell was on drugs. At one point while the group was holding Mitchell down, he moved Mitchell's clothing off his face, he said, according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson told investigators that Mitchell was not in a \"stable sort of mind,\" and he was speaking \"gibberish,\" the complaint said.\n\nHe said he remembered Mitchell saying \"stop\" and \"why\" and something about breathing while he was being held down. He told Williamson to stop applying pressure, which he did. Johnson-Carson said that Mitchell displayed \"clear signs of extreme distress, including gags, distressed breathing and repeated pleas for help,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint concludes that the employees had to have known Mitchell was in distress. \"All of these factors, the gasping, the actions and words of DM, the distress that he was in, show that all four Defendants were aware that holding DM face first on the ground was 'practically certain' to cause impairment of his physical condition,\" the complaint says.\n\nMitchell's relatives and their lawyers had previously reviewed hotel surveillance video provided by the district attorney's office. They described seeing Mitchell being chased inside the hotel by security guards and then dragged outside, where he was beaten.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of a team of lawyers representing Mitchell's family, has said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media shows security guards with their knees on Mitchell's back and neck.\n\nCrump posted a statement on X on Tuesday evening calling the charges \"a significant step towards justice for the family of D'Vontaye Mitchell!\"\n\nDeAsia Harmon, Mitchell's widow, said Tuesday that the decision was a relief. But she questioned why it took weeks.\n\n\"These people are on camera taking my husband's life,\" she said. \"They should have been charged the moment they did that.\"\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the company that manages the hotel, said previously that several employees involved in Mitchell's death have been fired.\n\nThe company released a statement Tuesday evening saying it had cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to cooperate with prosecutors. \"Our hearts are with Mr. Mitchell's family and loved ones as this case moves forward,\" the statement said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

on X on Tuesday evening calling the charges \"a significant step towards justice for the family of D'Vontaye Mitchell!\"\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the company that manages the hotel, said previously that several employees involved in Mitchell's death have been fired.\n\nThe company released a statement Tuesday evening saying it had cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to

Floyd's death sparked a national reckoning on race relations marked by multiple protests around the country.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, the four employees dragged Mitchell out of the Hyatt Hotel on June 30 after Mitchell entered a woman's bathroom and held him on his stomach for eight or nine minutes. One of the employees told investigators that Mitchell was having trouble breathing and repeatedly pleaded for help, according to the complaint.\n\nAn autopsy showed that Mitchell suffered from morbid obesity and had ingested cocaine and methamphetamine, the complaint said.\n\nReached by telephone Tuesday evening, one of the employees, security guard Todd Erickson, referred questions to his attorney, Michael Steinle, who did not immediately return voicemail and email messages seeking comment. It was unclear if the other three employees had attorneys. Online court records didn't list any for them Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said in a news release that arrest warrants had been issued for all four employees. The office and the Milwaukee Police Department did not immediately respond to emails inquiring if the employees had been arrested or had attorneys.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Hyatt surveillance video shows Mitchell frantically running into the hotel's lobby and then into the gift shop before entering the women's bathroom. A few seconds later, a woman emerges and an off-duty hotel security guard who happened to be visiting staff at that moment drags Mitchell out of the bathroom into the lobby by his shirt.\n\nThe two begin to struggle, and the guard punches Mitchell, knocking him to the floor. The guard then punches Mitchell six times and drags him out of the hotel with the help of a bystander. Mitchell gets up and tries to go back inside.\n\nA bellhop, a front desk worker and Erickson, who was on duty, then join the fray, and together they hold Mitchell down on his stomach for eight to nine minutes before police and emergency responders arrive. The video shows that during that span, Mitchell tries to break free multiple times, and Erickson hits him with a baton before he eventually stops moving, according to the complaint.\n\nA video taken by a witness includes audio of Mitchell moaning and saying he is sorry. An autopsy found that Mitchell was morbidly obese and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.\n\nThe county medical examiner ultimately determined that Mitchell died of \"restraint asphyxia.\" He may have lived if the employees allowed him to turn onto his side, the medical examiner said, according to the complaint.\n\nErickson told investigators that Mitchell was very strong and kept resisting them and tried to bite him. But the guard said he never did anything to intentionally hurt or harm Mitchell.\n\nThe off-duty security guard said that he heard women screaming in the bathroom after Mitchell entered it, and he thought Mitchell was on drugs. At one point, he moved Mitchell's clothing off his face, he said.\n\nThe front-desk worker told investigators that Mitchell was not in a \"stable sort of mind,\" and he was speaking \"gibberish,\" the complaint said.\n\nHe said he remembered Mitchell saying something about breathing while he was being held down but couldn't remember exactly what. He told the bellhop to stop applying pressure, which he did. The front desk worker said that Mitchell displayed \"clear signs of extreme distress, including gags, distressed breathing and repeated pleas for help,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint concludes that the four employees had to have known Mitchell was in distress. \"All of these factors, the gasping, the actions and words of DM, the distress that he was in, show that all four Defendants were aware that holding DM face first on the ground was 'practically certain' to cause impairment of his physical condition,\" the complaint says.\n\nMitchell's relatives and their lawyers had previously reviewed hotel surveillance video provided by the district attorney's office. They described seeing Mitchell being chased inside the hotel by security guards and then dragged outside, where he was beaten.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of a team of lawyers representing Mitchell's family, has said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media shows security guards with their knees on Mitchell's back and neck.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the company that manages the hotel, said previously that several employees involved in Mitchell's death have been fired.

At one point another hotel employee strikes Mitchell with a broom prior to a security guard throwing multiple punches.\n\nThe wife of D'Vontaye Mitchell and her attorney shared surveillance footage Friday evening from the night the 43-year-old died outside of the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nAt a press conference, Will Sulton, the attorney for Mitchell's wife and daughter, detailed the footage that shows Mitchell running through the lobby, staff and a bystander striking him repeatedly and him being restrained. The footage release came the same day the medical examiner ruled Mitchell's June 30 death a homicide.\n\nSome of what happened that day was known, as bystander video captured hotel employees holding Mitchell down outside of the hotel, but much of what happened prior wasn't publicly available until Friday. Sulton reviewed the footage weeks ago with the family and said previously, \"D'Vontaye was trying to run for his life.\"\n\nSulton said the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office provided him with the footage and other images following a subpoena.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel has independently reviewed the footage provided by Sulton -- five clips from surveillance cameras inside the hotel, the entrance, and just outside. Sulton said Hyatt has not provided all of the relevant footage. Here's what the videos show.\n\nMitchell runs through lobby, gift shop, into women's bathroom\n\nFootage from inside the hotel lobby shows Mitchell entering, and he is seen running through the lobby into the gift shop. It's unclear what happened just outside the door, but Sulton said Mitchell was attacked by an off-duty security guard. Hyatt has not provided that footage, Sulton said.\n\nMitchell's family believes he was suffering from a mental health episode. The medical examiner's report determined Mitchell's cause of death was \"restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine.\" The report said Mitchell's injury occurred as he was \"restrained in prone position by multiple individuals after drug (cocaine, methamphetamine) use.\"\n\nMitchell exits the gift shop and goes into the women's bathroom when the same off-duty security guard approaches the area off-camera. Moments later, a woman exits the bathroom and goes to the front desk while the security guard is seen escorting Mitchell out the hotel.\n\nSulton said there were two women in the bathroom when Mitchell ran in. Both those women said Mitchell was scared and needed help, according to Sulton.\n\nA struggle ensues and then the guard punches Mitchell in the face. A hotel guest also becomes involved in the struggle. Mitchell is thrown to the ground by the guard and guest before being dragged into the hotel entrance.\n\nHotel vestibule camera shows Mitchell repeatedly punched in the face, struck with broom\n\nA camera inside the hotel vestibule captured what happened next. The guard and guest continue to drag Mitchell as he seems to be struggling to stand, but is not throwing punches or kicking.\n\nAnother hotel employee is seen picking up a nearby broom and striking Mitchell on the leg. The guard then punches Mitchell in the face multiple times while in the doorway of the hotel.\n\nA camera outside the hotel entrance shows Mitchell is next kicked in the face by another hotel employee before being dragged into the driveway by an employee and a guest. Footage shows the off-duty security guard throwing more punches and directing Mitchell to turn over.\n\nOnce turned over, Sulton said an employee forced Mitchell's head into the ground. He received more records from the medical examiner and provided specifics on Friday. Among the records were photos of blunt force injuries to Mitchell's head and body, including broken ribs. Sulton said the forehead injuries were caused by the four employees restraining him on the concrete.\n\n\"All of this is designed to cause physical pain,\" Sulton said. \"There's no other explanation.\"\n\nThe employees continue to hold Mitchell down and at one point an employee hits Mitchell in the head with a baton while restrained, Sulton said. The original bystander video shows that this employee said to the camera, \"This is what happens when a man goes into the ladies' room.\"\n\nThe men then held Mitchell in that position until he died.\n\nIt's unclear when an employee called police, and the Journal Sentinel has requested the time dispatch was called.\n\nSeveral employees and others were present as the incident unfolded at the Hyatt. \"I submit that we call that party to a crime in our state,\" Sulton said. \"This is just a straight up beatdown.\"\n\nSulton said other people tried to intervene but Hyatt employees threatened them.\n\n\"It's not that nobody's doing anything, it's that these people are scared,\" he said. \"People took to social media to make sure people knew what would happen and without those video footage, they absolutely would have swept this under the rug.\"\n\nAttorney says its 'appalling' how authorities have handled the case\n\nThe Milwaukee Police Department referred four charges of felony murder to the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office in early July. Prosecutors have not made a charging decision.\n\nSulton said, based off the video, eight people should be charged with crimes. He said the department has been unprofessional and has lied about treating the death as a criminal matter. He specifically mentioned Police Chief Jeffrey Norman several times at Friday's news conference for prior comments he made, which he described as \"visceral.\"\n\nNorman said he wanted to \"set the record straight\" in response to Mitchell's death at a news conference just days after the death. \"If it's not something being reviewed in a criminal nature, then why is the DA looking at it? So we need to make sure that we set the record straight in regard to what's going on and who's talking in our community,\" he said.\n\nSulton said he had to take legal action to get transparency.\n\n\"The City of Milwaukee Police Department told the ME's office not to release any information, documents, or recordings to my office or the family,\" Sulton said. \"The medical examiner's office has ... its own independent legal obligations and they're simply setting those to the side and just saying we're only gonna do what the police department does. It's absolutely outrageous and it's 1,000% wrong.\n\n\"I really think that it's appalling in this particular case that this family had to go out hire a lawyer, file a case, issue a subpoena in order to get basic information. ... The police department needs to answer for why it is coddling these folks.\"\n\nSulton said it's not just the police department but private security hired by companies like Hyatt, and its operator, Aimbridge Hospitality.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is that society doesn't value all lives in the same way,\" he said. \"We have a significant problem with private security who run around like they're police and they're not. They don't have the authority to detain. They don't the authority to arrest. They don't have the authority to beat you.\"\n\nSulton said bodycam footage of the arriving officers shows interviews with the employees and witnesses. He said multiple employees lie about the events. The Journal Sentinel has not reviewed this footage.\n\n'He was afraid' and 'you beat him to death,' Mitchell's wife says\n\nMitchell's wife, DeAsia Harmon, was overcome with emotion while watching the footage again on Friday at Sulton's law firm on North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.\n\n\"I've never forgotten what this looks like,\" she said. \"Now it's made to the public, I have to make sure my daughter doesn't see it. ... This is somebody I spent 12 years of my life with and now I have to watch his life being taken for nothing. If he was wrong, he could have went to jail.\n\n\"He was afraid. He's a big guy, if he wanted to harm somebody it wouldn't be hard. He wanted to leave.\"\n\nHarmon said she would understand restraining him nonlethally until police arrived, but \"what they did to him was excessive. They didn't have to do him like that.\"\n\n\"You have to hold so much hatred in your heart to take someone's life like that. You beat him to death.\"\n\nDrake Bentley can be reached at DBentley1@gannett.com or 414-391-5647.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [],

Decker, states that Mitchell's \"injury\" happened while he was \"restrained in prone position by multiple individuals after drug (cocaine, methamphetamine) use.\"\n\nIt also states that Mitchell had the \"significant conditions\" of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and morbid obesity. A separate demographic report released by the medical examiner's office states that Mitchell was 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed 301 pounds (137 kilograms).\n\nThe medical examiner's office also released an investigative report on Friday that said Mitchell \"was restrained by four people after being combative in the hotel lobby.\"\n\nREAD MORE | Milwaukee, Wisconsin hotel employees fired after death of Black man who was pinned to ground\n\n\"He reportedly went unresponsive while staff awaited police arrival,\" the report said.\n\nMitchell died after he was held down on his stomach by security guards outside a Hyatt Regency hotel. Police have said he entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out.\n\nRelatives of Mitchell and their lawyers had previously reviewed hotel surveillance video provided by the district attorney's office. They described seeing Mitchell being chased inside the hotel by security guards and then dragged outside where he was beaten.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of a team of lawyers representing Mitchell's family, has said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media shows security guards with their knees on Mitchell's back and neck. Crump has also questioned why Milwaukee authorities had not filed any charges related to Mitchell's death.\n\nCrump and Mitchell's family said Friday in a statement that the autopsy findings and homicide ruling \"demand immediate charges against\" those involved in Mitchell's death.\n\n\"Mitchell was in the midst of a mental health crisis and, instead of abiding by their duty to protect and serve, the security officers and other Hyatt staff used excessive force that inflicted injury resulting in death,\" the statement says. \"We will not rest until we achieve justice for Mitchell and his grieving family.\"\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the company that manages the hotel, said previously that several employees involved in Mitchell's death have been fired.", "source": {"uri":

Please try again later.\n\nThe death of D'Vontaye Mitchell, a Black man who died after he was pinned to the ground by hotel security guards in June, was ruled a homicide by the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office, which released its final report on Mitchell's cause of death Friday.\n\nMitchell, 43, died of restraint asphyxia along with the effects of cocaine and methamphetamine, the autopsy found, noting that Mitchell was restrained by multiple people after he had used drugs.\n\nThe findings \"demand immediate charges\" against the security guards involved, the family's attorneys said in a statement released by lawyer Ben Crump.\n\nProsecutors investigating the death have been awaiting the autopsy as they weigh possible charges against people involved. The Milwaukee County district attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday morning.\n\nThe medical examiner also noted that Mitchell had hypertensive cardiovascular disease and obesity.\n\nMitchell's family has said they believe he was suffering from a mental health episode when he went into the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee on June 30. He allegedly appeared frantic and attempted to hide in the lobby, according to the medical examiner's investigation; security guards then began to drag him out of the hotel.\n\nOutside, four guards pinned him facedown on the concrete until police arrived, according to the investigation and witness video. The video showed Mitchell crying for help and apologizing as the guards appeared to hold him down. Police and emergency responders tried to resuscitate Mitchell after they arrived, but he died at the scene.\n\nThe hotel is operated by Aimbridge Hospitality, and that company fired employees after Mitchell's death. The four people who pinned down Mitchell have not been named by authorities.\n\nThe death drew comparisons to the 2020 killing of George Floyd, who was Black, by a White police officer who held Floyd down and knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. Floyd's killing by the officer, who was later convicted of murder, sparked national protests and ongoing scrutiny of police killings of Black Americans.\n\nThe medical examiner's office defines homicide as \"death 'at the hands of another'\" or as a result of \"an intentional harmful act of another person\" regardless of intent. It is independent of the legal definition of homicide.\n\nMitchell had two children and was married; authorities noted in their investigation that he had become homeless. His mother has said he had struggled with mental health issues since the 2016 death of his father. In their statement Friday, his family and their lawyers said they believed Mitchell was in the midst of a mental health crisis.\n\nInstead of helping him, they said, the hotel workers \"used excessive force that inflicted injury resulting in death.\"\n\n\"We will not rest until we achieve justice for Mitchell and his grieving family,\" Crump said in the statement.\n\nJiselle Lee and Anabelle Timsit contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justine_mcdaniel@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Justine McDaniel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asphyxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5TOQDXS3C7ECOW7F4CJ2CWWH7U_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788445", "eventUri": "eng-9788445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 1180, "textEnd": 1187}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The employees allegedly held him face down for eight to nine minutes.During this time, one employee noted that Mitchell struggled to breathe and repeatedly pleaded for help, as reported by AP.\n\nThe autopsy report revealed that Mitchell suffered from morbid obesity and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office announced that arrest warrants had been issued for all four employees. However, neither the District Attorney's office nor the Milwaukee Police Department immediately responded to inquiries about whether the employees had been arrested or had obtained legal counsel.\n\nSurveillance footage from the Hyatt Hotel captures D'Vontaye Mitchell running frantically into the hotel lobby, then into the gift shop before entering a women's restroom. Moments later, a woman exits the bathroom, and an off-duty security guard visiting the staff at the time pulls Mitchell out of the bathroom by his shirt and into the lobby.\n\nAt this point, a bellhop, a front desk worker, and Todd Erickson, an on-duty security guard, join in restraining Mitchell by holding him face down for eight to nine minutes until police and emergency personnel arrive.\n\nThe video footage shows Mitchell attempting multiple times to break free, with Erickson striking him with a baton until Mitchell eventually becomes unresponsive, according to the complaint.\n\nA video taken by a witness includes audio of Mitchell moaning and apologizing. The autopsy found that Mitchell was morbidly obese and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.\n\nThe medical examiner determined that Mitchell's cause of death was \"restraint asphyxia.\" The examiner noted that Mitchell might have survived if the employees had allowed him to turn onto his side, according to the complaint.\n\nErickson told investigators that Mitchell was strong, resisted, and attempted to bite him. However, Erickson stated that he did not intend to harm Mitchell.\n\nThe off-duty guard reported hearing women screaming in the bathroom after Mitchell entered and suspected he was under the influence of drugs. At one point, the guard said he adjusted Mitchell's clothing to uncover his face.\n\nThe front desk worker told investigators that Mitchell was not in a \"stable sort of mind\" and was speaking \"gibberish,\" the complaint said. He recalled Mitchell mentioning difficulty breathing while being held down but couldn't remember exactly what was said. He instructed the bellhop to stop applying pressure, which the bellhop did. The front desk worker noted that Mitchell displayed \"clear signs of extreme distress, including gagging, labored breathing, and repeated pleas for help,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint concludes that the employees must have known Mitchell was in distress. \"All of these factors -- the gasping, the actions and words of DM, and his visible distress -- indicate that all four defendants were aware that holding DM face down was 'practically certain' to impair his physical condition,\" it states.\n\nMitchell's family and their attorneys had previously reviewed the hotel surveillance video provided by the District Attorney's office. They described seeing security guards chasing Mitchell inside the hotel, dragging him outside, and beating him.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Mitchell's family, stated that a bystander's video circulating on social media shows security guards kneeling on Mitchell's back and neck.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the company managing the hotel, previously announced that several employees involved in the incident had been terminated. The company's media representatives did not immediately respond to phone calls or emails on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe incident has drawn comparisons to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died in 2020 after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for approximately nine minutes. Floyd's death ignited nationwide protests and sparked a national conversation on race relations.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

If convicted, they each would face up to 15 years and nine months in prison.\n\nAdvertisementBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nReached by telephone Tuesday evening, Erickson referred a request for comment to his attorney, Michael Steinle, who didn't return voicemail or email messages.\n\nIt was unclear if any of the other three employees had attorneys. Online court records didn't list any for them Tuesday evening. A telephone listing for Williamson had been disconnected, and The Associated Press could not immediately locate phone numbers or other contact information for Johnson-Carson or Turner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said in a news release that arrest warrants had been issued for all four employees. The office and the Milwaukee Police Department did not immediately respond to emails inquiring if the employees had been arrested or had attorneys.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, the four employees dragged Mitchell out of the Hyatt Hotel on June 30 after Mitchell entered a woman's bathroom and held him on his stomach for eight or nine minutes. One of the employees told investigators that Mitchell was having trouble breathing and repeatedly pleaded for help, according to the complaint.\n\nAn autopsy showed that Mitchell suffered from morbid obesity and had ingested cocaine and methamphetamine, the complaint said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHyatt surveillance video shows Mitchell frantically running into the hotel's lobby and then into the gift shop before entering the women's bathroom, the complaint said. A few seconds later, a woman emerges and Turner, who was off-duty but happened to be visiting staff at that moment, drags Mitchell out of the bathroom into the lobby by his shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two begin to struggle, and Turner punches Mitchell, knocking him to the floor. He then punches Mitchell six times and drags him out of the hotel with the help of a bystander. Mitchell gets up and tries to go back inside.\n\nWilliamson, Johnson-Carson and Erickson, who was on duty as the security manager, then join the fray. Together with Turner they hold Mitchell down on his stomach for eight to nine minutes before police and emergency responders arrive. The video shows that during that span, Mitchell tries to break free multiple times, and Erickson hits him with a baton before he eventually stops moving, according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA video taken by a witness includes audio of Mitchell moaning and saying he is sorry. An autopsy found that Mitchell was morbidly obese and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.\n\nThe county medical examiner ultimately determined that Mitchell died of \"restraint asphyxia.\" He may have lived if the employees allowed him to turn onto his side, the medical examiner said, according to the complaint.\n\nErickson told investigators that Mitchell was very strong and kept resisting them and tried to bite him. But the guard said he never did anything to intentionally hurt or harm Mitchell.\n\nTurner told a detective that said that he heard women screaming in the bathroom after Mitchell entered it, and he thought Mitchell was on drugs. At one point while the group was holding Mitchell down, he moved Mitchell's clothing off his face, he said, according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson-Carson told investigators that Mitchell was not in a \"stable sort of mind,\" and he was speaking \"gibberish,\" the complaint said.\n\nHe said he remembered Mitchell saying \"stop\" and \"why\" and something about breathing while he was being held down. He told Williamson to stop applying pressure, which he did. Johnson-Carson said that Mitchell displayed \"clear signs of extreme distress, including gags, distressed breathing and repeated pleas for help,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint concludes that the employees had to have known Mitchell was in distress. \"All of these factors, the gasping, the actions and words of DM, the distress that he was in, show that all four Defendants were aware that holding DM face first on the ground was 'practically certain' to cause impairment of his physical condition,\" the complaint says.\n\nMitchell's relatives and their lawyers had previously reviewed hotel surveillance video provided by the district attorney's office. They described seeing Mitchell being chased inside the hotel by security guards and then dragged outside, where he was beaten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of a team of lawyers representing Mitchell's family, has said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media shows security guards with their knees on Mitchell's back and neck.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the company that manages the hotel, said previously that several employees involved in Mitchell's death have been fired. The company released a statement Tuesday evening saying it had cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\n\"Our hearts are with Mr. Mitchell's family and loved ones as this case moves forward,\" the statement said.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreVP's campaign launches 'Republicans for Harris' in bid to lure GOP voters put off by TrumpTropical Storm Debby

According to a report from the medical examiner's office, before his death he was being restrained prone position on the sidewalk by four people until he became unresponsive.

Arrest warrants have been issued for the four people charged in the case, the office of Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said Tuesday.\n\nSecurity manager Todd Alan Erickson, front desk agent Devin W. Johnson-Carson, security guard Brandon LaDaniel Turner and bellman Herbert T. Williamson are the four defendants, court documents show. CNN has sought comment from the defendants and has reached out to prosecutors to see whether the four charged have attorneys.\n\nHotel employees escorted Mitchell out of the hotel June 30 and held him on concrete facedown after he entered the building in a frantic state, hid behind objects in the lobby, tried to lock himself inside a women's restroom and became combative with security, a medical examiner's investigation report released Friday said. Mitchell died from \"restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine,\" and the manner of death is homicide, according to an autopsy report released Friday by the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office.\n\nWhile the four defendants tackled Mitchell to the ground outside the hotel, one of them struck Mitchell multiple times; another hit him once; and another kicked him in the torso, the charging documents filed Tuesday say.\n\nThe four defendants then used \"various means of force\" to hold Mitchell in place while he was on the ground, \"including pushing down on (Mitchell's) back, shoulders and arms,\" and including one defendant appearing to strike Mitchell with a collapsable baton, court documents say.\n\n\"These charges are based on an extensive review of the evidence collected by the Milwaukee Police Department, the autopsy conducted and the report produced by the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office, and information received from members of the community, the DA's office said in a statement accompanying the release of criminal complaints.\n\nThe encounter unfolded as the use of force - particularly against people of color - by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after protests flared nationwide following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nMitchell's death had nothing to do with substance use, weight or high blood pressure, an attorney for his family, William Sulton, said Tuesday. \"What caused his death was the fact that four people beat him to death on the sidewalk and jumped on top of him,\" he said. \"That is why he's dead.\"\n\nMitchell's widow, DeAsia Harmon, said she was grateful for the charges but she isn't satisfied.\n\n\"I just want everyone to be held accountable for what they did to him,\" she said.\n\nIf convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to up to 15 years and nine months in prison.\n\nMitchell can be heard on video saying, 'I'm sorry'\n\nPart of a video posted on social media shows security guards and others pinning Mitchell to the ground. Mitchell grunts and pleads with the guards, repeatedly saying, \"Please,\" and \"I'm sorry,\" the video shows.\n\nOne of the guards, who appears to be White, can be heard saying, \"Stay down,\" and \"Stop fighting,\" as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \"This is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\"\n\nAt a Friday news conference, Sulton had played several new videos from the encounter, including security camera footage that revealed a view from inside the Hyatt as employees were removing Mitchell from the building.\n\nThe footage shows Mitchell being dragged across the floor inside the lobby, and from another angle outside that shows employees holding him down on the ground.\n\nSulton said the video shows one security guard punching Mitchell, who had been slammed to the ground, in the head.\n\nCNN has contacted Milwaukee police for comment on the videos.\n\nAfter Hyatt called for the employees involved to be terminated and criminally charged, Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the hotel, announced it had fired several of its associates.\n\nIt's unclear how long it took police officers to arrive on the scene and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel.\n\nWhen officers arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures, Milwaukee police have said without mentioning Mitchell by name.\n\nReport says encounter involved Mitchell being pulled out of women's bathroom\n\nThe medical examiner report said when Mitchell arrived at the hotel, he appeared to be frantic and panting. He was trying to hide in places in the lobby and then tried to lock himself and several females in the women's bathroom after he was asked to leave, the report says. Two security guards pulled him out of the bathroom and struggled to get him outside, where two other employees assisted them.\n\n\"This 43-year-old male was restrained by four people after being combative in the hotel lobby,\" an investigation report from the medical examiner's office states. \"He reportedly went unresponsive while staff awaited police arrival. Illicit drug paraphernalia was found on his person.\n\nMitchell's mother has said she believes he was suffering from a mental health episode and a family statement blamed excessive force for his death.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality first suspended the employees involved in the death and later fired them.\n\n\"The conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\" according to a company statement announcing their termination.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Emma Tucker, Ray Sanchez and Alisha Ebrahimji contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

WISN 12 News has blurred the faces of the hotel employees involved because no charges have been filed in the case. Attorney William Sulton, one of the lawyers representing Mitchell's family, said Friday the video proves the case warrants criminal charges.

Two people, Sulton identified as a Hyatt employee and a guest, grab Mitchell and throw him to the ground. Another camera shows those two people dragging Mitchell into the hotel entryway. There, a different person, also an employee, according to Sulton, approaches and grabs a broom before she starts hitting Mitchell with it.

They were identified in the criminal complaint as Todd Alan Erickson, a security guard; Devin W. Johnson-Carson, a front desk agent; Brandon Ladaniel Turner a security guard who was off-duty at the time; and Herbert T. Williamson, a bellman. ABC News has reached out to them for comment.\n\nThe Milwaukee County medical examiner ruled Mitchell's death was a homicide, the result of restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. People gathered outside the Milwaukee District Attorney's Office on Monday to demand charges be filed in his death.\n\nThe criminal complaint references security footage from the hotel that it stated \"captured much of the incident leading up to\" Mitchell's death.\n\nMitchell, 43, \"appears to be [in] a frantic manner\" while running across the hotel lobby and is then seen running out of a gift shop toward the women's bathroom, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint alleges that after dragging Mitchell through the hotel lobby doors to the driveway, Turner struck Mitchell repeatedly with his fist. Johnson-Carson is also accused of striking Mitchell with a fist and Erickson of kicking him in the torso.\n\n\"Complainant notes that throughout the video, [Mitchell's] behavior is erratic and confusing, and he engages in continuous physical resistance against the men described above. But [Mitchell] does not instigate any violence or display any obviously aggressive or threatening behavior while on the hotel premises,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe complaint then alleges that the four men restrained Mitchell while he was lying face down for approximately eight to nine minutes until police and emergency responders arrived. At one point Erickson \"appears to strike\" Mitchell with a collapsible baton, the complaint stated.\n\n\"Towards the end of that time period, [Mitchell] has stopped showing movement or resistance or other signs of life,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe complaint also referenced a Facebook video of the incident that it stated \"shows loud breathing and gasps while [Mitchell] is saying he is sorry.\"\n\nErickson, who was the on-duty security manager that day, told police that Mitchell \"was very strong and kept resisting them\" and at one point attempted to bite him, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Erickson stated that he did not do anything to intentionally harm or kill\" Mitchell, the complaint stated.\n\nWilliamson, who had been employed as a bellman for a month and a half at the time of the incident, told police that he saw Mitchell \"being very forceful with the security guards\" and was \"very aggressive,\" according to the complaint.\n\nHe told police that Mitchell \"kept struggling and asking what did he do wrong\" while being pinned down, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Williamson stated that he got off [Mitchell], and Williamson stated that he thought [Mitchell] was still responsive. However, 'the next thing you know, I realized he was unconscious,'\" the complaint stated.\n\nTurner told police that he saw Mitchell \"begging and harassing a guest\" and admitted to punching Mitchell \"several times,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson, who had been working at the front desk for about two months at the time of the incident, told police that he \"remembers [Mitchell ] stating something about breathing\" and saw Erickson check Mitchell's pulse a few times, according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson told police that he \"never saw anyone strangle [Mitchell] and that neither he nor the other four staff members ever state that they believed that [Mitchell] was not breathing during the time he was face first on the ground,\" the complaint stated.\n\nMORE: 'She called for help and we failed': Sheriff asks forgiveness for Sonya Massey shooting\n\nThe four workers were terminated based on their actions, according to Aimbridge Hospitality, the hotel management firm that employed them.\n\n\"We are continuing to do everything we can to support law enforcement with their ongoing investigation of this tragedy, and will continue our own investigation,\" Aimbridge Hospitality said in the statement to ABC News.\n\nAfter news of the charges broke, a spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality said they will continue to cooperate.\n\n\"Our hearts are with Mr. Mitchell's family and loved ones as this case moves forward. We have cooperated fully with law enforcement in their investigation into this tragic incident and will continue to cooperate with the district attorney,\" the statement read.\n\nBen Crump, an attorney for the family, called the charges a \"significant step towards justice.\"\n\n\"The evidence, including security footage and witness statements, paints a disturbing picture of a man in distress who was met with excessive and lethal force,\" Crump said in a statement. \"The fact that D'Vontaye was held face down on the pavement for eight to nine minutes -- just like George Floyd -- is a sobering reminder of the urgent need for accountability and justice.\"\n\nMitchell's widow, Deasia Harmon, told reporters Tuesday that she is \"grateful\" for the charges, though she expressed frustration at the length of the investigation.\n\n\"I just want everyone to be held accountable,\" she said. \"I'm trying to get his story out there, to let his voice be heard through me, for my family, and for his family. We all want justice for him. It's something they should have done from the beginning.\"\n\nLocal family attorney William Sulton said in a statement to ABC News, the incident shouldn't have happened.\n\n\"While we agree that the employees should be charged with murder, we are mindful of the fact that this would not have happened without Mr. Mitchell's family's hiring lawyers to investigate the murder,\" Sulton said in the statement.\n\n\"The family should not have had to wait 37 days for charges when the murder was captured on video. We ask that the public continue to support the family through this difficult time,\" his statement concluded.\n\nABC News' Davi Merchan contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

They were identified in the criminal complaint as Todd Alan Erickson, a security guard; Devin W. Johnson-Carson, a front desk agent; Brandon Ladaniel Turner a security guard who was off-duty at the time; and Herbert T. Williamson, a bellman. ABC News has reached out to them for comment.\n\nThe Milwaukee County medical examiner ruled Mitchell's death was a homicide, the result of restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. People gathered outside the Milwaukee District Attorney's Office on Monday to demand charges be filed in his death.\n\nThe criminal complaint references security footage from the hotel that it stated \"captured much of the incident leading up to\" Mitchell's death.\n\nMitchell, 43, \"appears to be [in] a frantic manner\" while running across the hotel lobby and is then seen running out of a gift shop toward the women's bathroom, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint alleges that after dragging Mitchell through the hotel lobby doors to the driveway, Turner struck Mitchell repeatedly with his fist. Johnson-Carson is also accused of striking Mitchell with a fist and Erickson of kicking him in the torso.\n\n\"Complainant notes that throughout the video, [Mitchell's] behavior is erratic and confusing, and he engages in continuous physical resistance against the men described above. But [Mitchell] does not instigate any violence or display any obviously aggressive or threatening behavior while on the hotel premises,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe complaint then alleges that the four men restrained Mitchell while he was lying face down for approximately eight to nine minutes until police and emergency responders arrived. At one point Erickson \"appears to strike\" Mitchell with a collapsible baton, the complaint stated.\n\n\"Towards the end of that time period, [Mitchell] has stopped showing movement or resistance or other signs of life,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe complaint also referenced a Facebook video of the incident that it stated \"shows loud breathing and gasps while [Mitchell] is saying he is sorry.\"\n\nErickson, who was the on-duty security manager that day, told police that Mitchell \"was very strong and kept resisting them\" and at one point attempted to bite him, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Erickson stated that he did not do anything to intentionally harm or kill\" Mitchell, the complaint stated.\n\nWilliamson, who had been employed as a bellman for a month and a half at the time of the incident, told police that he saw Mitchell \"being very forceful with the security guards\" and was \"very aggressive,\" according to the complaint.\n\nHe told police that Mitchell \"kept struggling and asking what did he do wrong\" while being pinned down, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Williamson stated that he got off [Mitchell], and Williamson stated that he thought [Mitchell] was still responsive. However, 'the next thing you know, I realized he was unconscious,'\" the complaint stated.\n\nTurner told police that he saw Mitchell \"begging and harassing a guest\" and admitted to punching Mitchell \"several times,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson, who had been working at the front desk for about two months at the time of the incident, told police that he \"remembers [Mitchell ] stating something about breathing\" and saw Erickson check Mitchell's pulse a few times, according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson told police that he \"never saw anyone strangle [Mitchell] and that neither he nor the other four staff members ever state that they believed that [Mitchell] was not breathing during the time he was face first on the ground,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe four workers were terminated based on their actions, according to Aimbridge Hospitality, the hotel management firm that employed them.\n\n\"We are continuing to do everything we can to support law enforcement with their ongoing investigation of this tragedy, and will continue our own investigation,\" Aimbridge Hospitality said in the statement to ABC News.\n\nAfter news of the charges broke, a spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality said they will continue to cooperate.\n\n\"Our hearts are with Mr. Mitchell's family and loved ones as this case moves forward. We have cooperated fully with law enforcement in their investigation into this tragic incident and will continue to cooperate with the district attorney,\" the statement read.\n\nBen Crump, an attorney for the family, called the charges a \"significant step towards justice.\"\n\n\"The evidence, including security footage and witness statements, paints a disturbing picture of a man in distress who was met with excessive and lethal force,\" Crump said in a statement. \"The fact that D'Vontaye was held face down on the pavement for eight to nine minutes -- just like George Floyd -- is a sobering reminder of the urgent need for accountability and justice.\"\n\nMitchell's widow, Deasia Harmon, told reporters Tuesday that she is \"grateful\" for the charges, though she expressed frustration at the length of the investigation.\n\n\"I just want everyone to be held accountable,\" she said. \"I'm trying to get his story out there, to let his voice be heard through me, for my family, and for his family. We all want justice for him. It's something they should have done from the beginning.\"\n\nLocal family attorney William Sulton said in a statement to ABC News, the incident shouldn't have happened.\n\n\"While we agree that the employees should be charged with murder, we are mindful of the fact that this would not have happened without Mr. Mitchell's family's hiring lawyers to investigate the murder,\" Sulton said in the statement.\n\n\"The family should not have had to wait 37 days for charges when the murder was captured on video. We ask that the public continue to support the family through this difficult time,\" his statement concluded.", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony murder rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamson_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Williamson County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Williamson County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellhop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bellhop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asphyxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimbridge_Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aimbridge Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/assets/news/kabc/images/logos/default_300x169.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788445", "eventUri": "eng-9788445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 393, "textEnd": 400}], "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Floyd's death sparked a national reckoning over race relations, marked by multiple protests across the country.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, the four employees dragged Mitchell from the Hyatt Hotel on June 30 after Mitchell entered a women's restroom and held him on his stomach for eight or nine minutes. One of the employees told investigators that Mitchell was having trouble breathing and repeatedly begged for help, the complaint said.\n\nA autopsy The indictment revealed that Mitchell was morbidly obese and had used cocaine and methamphetamine.\n\nReached by phone Tuesday night, one of the employees, security guard Todd Erickson, referred questions to his attorney, Michael Steinle, who did not immediately respond to voicemail and email messages seeking comment. It was unclear whether the other three employees had attorneys. Online court records did not list one Tuesday night.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office said in a news release that arrest warrants had been issued for all four employees. The office and the Milwaukee Police Department did not immediately respond to emails seeking information about whether the employees had been arrested or had attorneys.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Hyatt surveillance video shows Mitchell running frantically into the hotel lobby and then into the gift shop before entering the women's restroom. Seconds later, a woman comes out and a hotel security guard who happened to be visiting staff at the time drags Mitchell by his shirt from the bathroom into the lobby.\n\nThe two begin to struggle and the guard punches Mitchell, knocking him to the ground. The guard then punches Mitchell six times and, with the help of a bystander, drags him out of the hotel. Mitchell gets up and tries to go back inside.\n\nA bellhop, a receptionist and Erickson, who was on duty, then joined in the struggle and held Mitchell on his stomach for eight to nine minutes before police and emergency responders arrived. The video shows Mitchell trying to break free several times during that time and Erickson hitting him with a baton before he finally stops moving, the complaint said.\n\nA video taken by a witness contains audio of Mitchell groaning and saying he was sorry. An autopsy found Mitchell was morbidly obese and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.\n\nThe county coroner ultimately determined that Mitchell died of \"asphyxiation by restraint.\" He may have been alive if workers had allowed him to turn onto his side, the coroner said, according to the complaint.\n\nErickson told investigators that Mitchell was very strong and kept resisting and trying to bite him. But the guard said he never did anything to intentionally hurt or harm Mitchell.\n\nThe off-duty security guard said he heard women screaming in the bathroom after Mitchell entered, and he thought Mitchell was on drugs. At one point, he pulled Mitchell's clothing off his face, he said.\n\nThe receptionist told investigators that Mitchell was not in a \"stable state of mind\" and that he was \"talking nonsense,\" the complaint said.\n\nHe said he remembered Mitchell saying something about breathing while he was being held down, but he couldn't remember exactly what. He told the bellhop to stop applying pressure, which he did. The bellhop said Mitchell \"showed clear signs of extreme distress, including gagging, labored breathing, and repeated pleas for help,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe complaint concludes that the four employees should have known that Mitchell was in distress. \"All of these factors, DM's panting, his actions and words, his distress, demonstrate that all four defendants knew that it was 'virtually certain' that holding DM face first to the ground would worsen his physical condition,\" the complaint states.\n\nMitchell's family members and their attorneys had previously rated hotel security video provided by the district attorney's office. They described seeing Mitchell being chased into the hotel by security guards and then dragged outside, where he was beaten.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of a team of attorneys representing Mitchell's family, said video footage recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media showed security guards pressing their knees into Mitchell's back and neck.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the company that manages the hotel, said earlier that several employees involved in Mitchell's death had been fired. Media representatives for the company did not immediately respond to emails and phone calls Tuesday evening.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_toilet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public toilet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiding_and_abetting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aiding and abetting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptionist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Receptionist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellhop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bellhop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4-hotel-employees-charged-with-being-party-to-felony-murder.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788445", "eventUri": "eng-9788445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 544, "textEnd": 551}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Floyd's death sparked a national reckoning on race relations marked by multiple protests around the country.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, the four employees dragged Mitchell out of the Hyatt Hotel on June 30 after Mitchell entered a woman's bathroom and held him on his stomach for eight or nine minutes. One of the employees told investigators that Mitchell was having trouble breathing and repeatedly pleaded for help, according to the complaint.\n\nAn autopsy showed that Mitchell suffered from morbid obesity and had ingested cocaine and methamphetamine, the complaint said.\n\nIt was unclear if any of the employees had attorneys or were in custody Tuesday evening. The Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said in a news release that warrants had been issued for their arrests. The office and the Milwaukee Police Department did not immediately respond to emails inquiring if the employees had been arrested or had attorneys.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Hyatt surveillance video shows Mitchell frantically running into the hotel's lobby and then into the gift shop before entering the women's bathroom. A few seconds later, a woman emerges and an off-duty hotel security guard who happened to be visiting staff at that moment drags Mitchell out of the bathroom into the lobby by his shirt.\n\nThe two begin to struggle, and the guard punches Mitchell, knocking him to the floor. The guard then punches Mitchell six times and drags him out of the hotel with the help of a bystander. Mitchell gets up and tries to go back inside.\n\nA bellhop, a front desk worker and an on-duty security guard then join the fray, and together they hold Mitchell down on his stomach for eight to nine minutes before police and emergency responders arrive. During that span, Mitchell tries to break free multiple times, and the on-duty guard hits him with a baton before he eventually stops moving.\n\nA video taken by a witness includes audio of Mitchell moaning and saying he is sorry. An autopsy found that Mitchell was morbidly obese and had cocaine and methamphetamine in his system.\n\nThe county medical examiner ultimately determined that Mitchell died of \"restraint asphyxia.\" He may have lived if the employees allowed him to turn onto his side, the medical examiner said, according to the complaint.\n\nThe on-duty security guard told investigators that Mitchell was very strong and kept resisting them and tried to bite him. But the guard said he never did anything to intentionally hurt or harm Mitchell.\n\nThe off-duty security guard said that he heard women screaming in the bathroom after Mitchell entered it, and he thought Mitchell was on drugs. At one point, he moved Mitchell's clothing off his face, he said.\n\nThe front-desk worker told investigators that Mitchell was not in a \"stable sort of mind,\" and he was speaking \"gibberish,\" the complaint said.\n\nHe said he remembered Mitchell saying something about breathing while he was being held down but couldn't remember exactly what. He told the bellhop to stop applying pressure, which he did. The front desk worker said that Mitchell displayed \"clear signs of extreme distress, including gags, distressed breathing and repeated pleas for help,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint concludes that the four employees had to have known Mitchell was in distress. \"All of these factors, the gasping, the actions and words of DM, the distress that he was in, show that all four Defendants were aware that holding DM face first on the ground was 'practically certain' to cause impairment of his physical condition,\" the complaint says.\n\nMitchell's relatives and their lawyers had previously reviewed hotel surveillance video provided by the district attorney's office. They described seeing Mitchell being chased inside the hotel by security guards and then dragged outside, where he was beaten.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of a team of lawyers representing Mitchell's family, has said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media shows security guards with their knees on Mitchell's back and neck.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the company that manages the hotel, said previously that several employees involved in Mitchell's death have been fired.

The decision came after the medical examiner released findings last week calling the death a homicide.\n\nMitchell died June 30 after hotel employees pulled him from the Hyatt Regency in downtown Milwaukee and held him down on the sidewalk. Video circulated on social media drew comparisons to the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Medical Examiner determined Mitchell was killed by restraint asphyxia and the toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine.\n\nHis family has been pushing for criminal prosecutions in the case.\n\n\"They're charging them with the obvious,\" DeAsia Harmon, Mitchell's widow, said at a press conference Tuesday night. \"We all seen the videos, we've all heard the audio, there was nothing stopping them from charging these people from day one.\"\n\nHarmon said she was \"grateful\" that the charges were filed, but she wished they would have been filed sooner.\n\n\"They should have done it a long time ago,\" she said.\n\n\"I just want everyone to be held accountable for what they did to him,\" she added.\n\nA statement from the district attorney's office said the charging decision was based on evidence collected by the Milwaukee Police Department, the autopsy and information from the community.\n\nThe four men charged are all residents of Milwaukee or South Milwaukee and include Todd Erickson, 60, Devin Johnson-Carson, 23, Brandon Turner, 35, and Herbert Williamson, 53.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, video from the hotel shows Mitchell run into the hotel lobby \"in a frantic manner\" before running into a women's bathroom, which was occupied by at least two women. One of the women later told police Mitchell appeared to try to lock the door.\n\nTurner got Mitchell out of the bathroom, but the two struggled. Other employees then began to help drag Mitchell out of the hotel. One employee hit Mitchell with a broom, according to the complaint. Turner, Johnson-Carson and Erickson all either punched or kicked Mitchell once he was outside.\n\nThroughout the incident captured on video, Mitchell's \"behavior is erratic and confusing, and he engages in continuous physical resistance against the men,\" the complaint states. \"But (Mitchell) does not instigate any violence or display any obviously aggressive or threatening behavior while on the hotel premises.\"\n\nThe video showed Mitchell on the ground outside the hotel holding up his arm to shield blows, according to the complaint. After the four men flipped him face down on the ground, they held him in that position for eight to nine minutes, the complaint states.\n\n\"Towards the end of that time period, (Mitchell) has stopped showing movement or resistance or other signs of life,\" the complaint states.\n\nThe DA's office said arrest warrants have been issued Tuesday for the four men.\n\nBut William Sulton, the attorney for the family, said he wasn't satisfied with the charges -- he wanted to see a reckless homicide charge. Even so, he said he's confident the guards will be convicted.\n\n\"At least today we can say that the obvious has happened -- murder charges filed against murderers on camera,\" Sulton said.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump is also representing the family. In a statement, he said the charges were a \"significant step towards justice.\"\n\n\"The charges filed today are an important step, but they are just the beginning,\" the statement said. \"D'Vontaye's life mattered, and his story will not be forgotten.\"\n\nFelony murder is a lesser charge than first degree intentional homicide.

They were identified in the criminal complaint as Todd Alan Erickson, a security guard; Devin W. Johnson-Carson, a front desk agent; Brandon Ladaniel Turner a security guard who was off-duty at the time; and Herbert T. Williamson, a bellman. ABC News has reached out to them for comment.\n\nThe Milwaukee County medical examiner ruled Mitchell's death was a homicide, the result of restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. People gathered outside the Milwaukee District Attorney's Office on Monday to demand charges be filed in his death.\n\nThe criminal complaint references security footage from the hotel that it stated \"captured much of the incident leading up to\" Mitchell's death.\n\nMitchell, 43, \"appears to be [in] a frantic manner\" while running across the hotel lobby and is then seen running out of a gift shop toward the women's bathroom, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint alleges that after dragging Mitchell through the hotel lobby doors to the driveway, Turner struck Mitchell repeatedly with his fist. Johnson-Carson is also accused of striking Mitchell with a fist and Erickson of kicking him in the torso.\n\n\"Complainant notes that throughout the video, [Mitchell's] behavior is erratic and confusing, and he engages in continuous physical resistance against the men described above. But [Mitchell] does not instigate any violence or display any obviously aggressive or threatening behavior while on the hotel premises,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe complaint then alleges that the four men restrained Mitchell while he was lying face down for approximately eight to nine minutes until police and emergency responders arrived. At one point Erickson \"appears to strike\" Mitchell with a collapsible baton, the complaint stated.\n\n\"Towards the end of that time period, [Mitchell] has stopped showing movement or resistance or other signs of life,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe complaint also referenced a Facebook video of the incident that it stated \"shows loud breathing and gasps while [Mitchell] is saying he is sorry.\"\n\nErickson, who was the on-duty security manager that day, told police that Mitchell \"was very strong and kept resisting them\" and at one point attempted to bite him, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Erickson stated that he did not do anything to intentionally harm or kill\" Mitchell, the complaint stated.\n\nWilliamson, who had been employed as a bellman for a month and a half at the time of the incident, told police that he saw Mitchell \"being very forceful with the security guards\" and was \"very aggressive,\" according to the complaint.\n\nHe told police that Mitchell \"kept struggling and asking what did he do wrong\" while being pinned down, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Williamson stated that he got off [Mitchell], and Williamson stated that he thought [Mitchell] was still responsive. However, 'the next thing you know, I realized he was unconscious,'\" the complaint stated.\n\nTurner told police that he saw Mitchell \"begging and harassing a guest\" and admitted to punching Mitchell \"several times,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson, who had been working at the front desk for about two months at the time of the incident, told police that he \"remembers [Mitchell ] stating something about breathing\" and saw Erickson check Mitchell's pulse a few times, according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson told police that he \"never saw anyone strangle [Mitchell] and that neither he nor the other four staff members ever state that they believed that [Mitchell] was not breathing during the time he was face first on the ground,\" the complaint stated.\n\nMORE: 'She called for help and we failed': Sheriff asks forgiveness for Sonya Massey shooting\n\nThe four workers were terminated based on their actions, according to Aimbridge Hospitality, the hotel management firm that employed them.\n\n\"We are continuing to do everything we can to support law enforcement with their ongoing investigation of this tragedy, and will continue our own investigation,\" Aimbridge Hospitality said in the statement to ABC News.\n\nBen Crump, an attorney for the family, called the charges a \"significant step towards justice.\"\n\n\"The evidence, including security footage and witness statements, paints a disturbing picture of a man in distress who was met with excessive and lethal force,\" Crump said in a statement. \"The fact that D'Vontaye was held face down on the pavement for eight to nine minutes -- just like George Floyd -- is a sobering reminder of the urgent need for accountability and justice.\"\n\nMitchell's widow, Deasia Harmon, told reporters Tuesday that she is \"grateful\" for the charges, though she expressed frustration at the length of the investigation.\n\n\"I just want everyone to be held accountable,\" she said. \"I'm trying to get his story out there, to let his voice be heard through me, for my family, and for his family. We all want justice for him. It's something they should have done from the beginning.\"\n\nLocal family attorney William Sulton said in a statement to ABC News, the incident shouldn't have happened.\n\n\"While we agree that the employees should be charged with murder, we are mindful of the fact that this would not have happened without Mr. Mitchell's family's hiring lawyers to investigate the murder,\" Sulton said in the statement.\n\n\"The family should not have had to wait 37 days for charges when the murder was captured on video. We ask that the public continue to support the family through this difficult time,\" his statement concluded.\n\nABC News' Davi Merchan contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

Those results came back last week. In my opinion, you should have been at these people's houses the same day they came out,\" she continued.\n\nThe demands come days after the Milwaukee County medical examiner ruled Mitchell's death was a homicide, the result of restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine.\n\n\"The medical examiner's report confirms the obvious here, which was that, you know, D'Vontaye Mitchell was murdered outside of the Hyatt Hotel in Milwaukee by Aimbridge Hospitality employees,\" William Sulton, one of the attorneys representing Mitchell's family, told ABC News.\n\nOn Friday, Sulton released newly obtained surveillance video that showed the moments leading up to Mitchell's death.\n\n\"It broke my heart. I didn't know what to feel. I didn't know how to feel. If it broke something inside of me because it was so brutal and just what they did to him. It's unbelievable,\" DeAsia Harmon, Mitchell's wife, told ABC News in an interview after seeing the surveillance videos.\n\nOn June 30, Mitchell, 43, showed up to the Milwaukee Hyatt Regency hotel acting frantically, running into the hotel's gift shop and women's bathroom, surveillance video showed. Mitchell's family has said he was having a mental health episode.\n\nThe newly released surveillance video shows one security guard dragging Mitchell through the lobby doors before another security guard joins him and starts punching Mitchell while he is still on the ground. A hotel employee then grabs a broom and starts striking Mitchell. The security guards continue to punch Mitchell before he is pinned to the ground for more than 8 minutes, the video, reviewed by ABC News, shows.\n\n\"What these videos demonstrate is that he was brutally beaten to death,\" Sulton said, adding Mitchell's family expects the District Attorney's Office will now charge the security guards.\n\n\"We were fortunate in this case to have onlookers who had cell phone video footage, which allowed us to prove that Mr. Mitchell was murdered,\" Sulton said, adding that \"there are still items that need to be investigated. There's still evidence that needs to be collected.\"\n\nOn July 12, the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) released a statement saying they had initiated a death investigation the day of the incident, referring felony murder charges with the underlying charge of battery to the District Attorney's Office on July 5. MPD said the investigation was ongoing and declined further comment.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality, the hotel management firm that employed the security guards, told ABC News in a new statement they had terminated the guards after reviewing their actions, which were in violation of their policies and procedures. The security guards involved in the incident have not been identified.\n\n\"We are continuing to do everything we can to support law enforcement with their ongoing investigation of this tragedy, and will continue our own investigation,\" Aimbridge Hospitality said in the statement\n\nHarmon, Mitchell's wife, said she was devastated to learn the circumstances of her husband's death. \"I didn't know what to think. I didn't know what to feel. I just knew that a part of me was going. A part of me was gone. My daughter just lost her father. And it's still not real to me,\" Harmon said.\n\n\"He was a gentle giant. He was loving and caring, and he was smart and funny and very talented. He was a wonderful father, wonderful husband, great friend, brother, cousin, son, all across the board.

They were identified in the criminal complaint as Todd Alan Erickson, a security guard; Devin W. Johnson-Carson, a front desk agent; Brandon Ladaniel Turner a security guard who was off-duty at the time; and Herbert T. Williamson, a bellman. ABC News has reached out to them for comment.\n\nThe Milwaukee County medical examiner ruled Mitchell's death was a homicide, the result of restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. People gathered outside the Milwaukee District Attorney's Office on Monday to demand charges be filed in his death.\n\nThe criminal complaint references security footage from the hotel that it stated \"captured much of the incident leading up to\" Mitchell's death.\n\nMitchell, 43, \"appears to be [in] a frantic manner\" while running across the hotel lobby and is then seen running out of a gift shop toward the women's bathroom, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint alleges that after dragging Mitchell through the hotel lobby doors to the driveway, Turner struck Mitchell repeatedly with his fist. Johnson-Carson is also accused of striking Mitchell with a fist and Erickson of kicking him in the torso.\n\n\"Complainant notes that throughout the video, [Mitchell's] behavior is erratic and confusing, and he engages in continuous physical resistance against the men described above. But [Mitchell] does not instigate any violence or display any obviously aggressive or threatening behavior while on the hotel premises,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe complaint then alleges that the four men restrained Mitchell while he was lying face down for approximately eight to nine minutes until police and emergency responders arrived. At one point Erickson \"appears to strike\" Mitchell with a collapsible baton, the complaint stated.\n\n\"Towards the end of that time period, [Mitchell] has stopped showing movement or resistance or other signs of life,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe complaint also referenced a Facebook video of the incident that it stated \"shows loud breathing and gasps while [Mitchell] is saying he is sorry.\"\n\nErickson, who was the on-duty security manager that day, told police that Mitchell \"was very strong and kept resisting them\" and at one point attempted to bite him, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Erickson stated that he did not do anything to intentionally harm or kill\" Mitchell, the complaint stated.\n\nWilliamson, who had been employed as a bellman for a month and a half at the time of the incident, told police that he saw Mitchell \"being very forceful with the security guards\" and was \"very aggressive,\" according to the complaint.\n\nHe told police that Mitchell \"kept struggling and asking what did he do wrong\" while being pinned down, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Williamson stated that he got off [Mitchell], and Williamson stated that he thought [Mitchell] was still responsive. However, 'the next thing you know, I realized he was unconscious,'\" the complaint stated.\n\nTurner told police that he saw Mitchell \"begging and harassing a guest\" and admitted to punching Mitchell \"several times,\" according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson, who had been working at the front desk for about two months at the time of the incident, told police that he \"remembers [Mitchell ] stating something about breathing\" and saw Erickson check Mitchell's pulse a few times, according to the complaint.\n\nJohnson-Carson told police that he \"never saw anyone strangle [Mitchell] and that neither he nor the other four staff members ever state that they believed that [Mitchell] was not breathing during the time he was face first on the ground,\" the complaint stated.\n\nThe four workers were terminated based on their actions, according to Aimbridge Hospitality, the hotel management firm that employed them.\n\n\"We are continuing to do everything we can to support law enforcement with their ongoing investigation of this tragedy, and will continue our own investigation,\" Aimbridge Hospitality said in the statement to ABC News.\n\nBen Crump, an attorney for the family, called the charges a \"significant step towards justice.\"\n\n\"The evidence, including security footage and witness statements, paints a disturbing picture of a man in distress who was met with excessive and lethal force,\" Crump said in a statement. \"The fact that D'Vontaye was held face down on the pavement for eight to nine minutes -- just like George Floyd -- is a sobering reminder of the urgent need for accountability and justice.\"\n\nMitchell's widow, Deasia Harmon, told reporters Tuesday that she is \"grateful\" for the charges, though she expressed frustration at the length of the investigation.\n\n\"I just want everyone to be held accountable,\" she said. \"I'm trying to get his story out there, to let his voice be heard through me, for my family, and for his family. We all want justice for him. It's something they should have done from the beginning.\"\n\nLocal family attorney William Sulton said in a statement to ABC News, the incident shouldn't have happened.\n\n\"While we agree that the employees should be charged with murder, we are mindful of the fact that this would not have happened without Mr. Mitchell's family's hiring lawyers to investigate the murder,\" Sulton said in the statement.\n\n\"The family should not have had to wait 37 days for charges when the murder was captured on video. We ask that the public continue to support the family through this difficult time,\" his statement concluded.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony murder rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamson_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Williamson County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Williamson County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asphyxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimbridge_Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aimbridge Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/358a03be-3d25-493e-b0ad-a16fc84b8e83/dvontaye-mitchell-death-gty-lv-240806_1722986492873_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788445", "eventUri": "eng-9788445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 473, "textEnd": 480}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The footage release came the same day the medical examiner ruled Mitchell's June 30 death a homicide.\n\nSome of what happened that day was known, as bystander video captured hotel employees holding Mitchell down outside of the hotel, but much of what happened prior wasn't publicly available until Friday. Sulton reviewed the footage weeks ago with the family and said previously, \"D'Vontaye was trying to run for his life.\"\n\nSulton said the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office provided him with the footage and other images following a subpoena.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel has independently reviewed the footage provided by Sulton -- five clips from surveillance cameras inside the hotel, the entrance, and just outside. Sulton said Hyatt has not provided all of the relevant footage. Here's what the videos show.\n\nFootage from inside the hotel lobby shows Mitchell entering, and he is seen running through the lobby into the gift shop. It's unclear what happened just outside the door, but Sulton said Mitchell was attacked by an off-duty security guard. Hyatt has not provided that footage, Sulton said.\n\nMitchell's family believes he was suffering from a mental health episode. The medical examiner's report determined Mitchell's cause of death was \"restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine.\" The report said Mitchell's injury occurred as he was \"restrained in prone position by multiple individuals after drug (cocaine, methamphetamine) use.\"\n\nMitchell exits the gift shop and goes into the women's bathroom when the same off-duty security guard approaches the area off-camera. Moments later, a woman exits the bathroom and goes to the front desk while the security guard is seen escorting Mitchell out the hotel.\n\nSulton said there were two women in the bathroom when Mitchell ran in. Both those women said Mitchell was scared and needed help, according to Sulton.\n\nA struggle ensues and then the guard punches Mitchell in the face. A hotel guest also becomes involved in the struggle. Mitchell is thrown to the ground by the guard and guest before being dragged into the hotel entrance.\n\nA camera inside the hotel vestibule captured what happened next. The guard and guest continue to drag Mitchell as he seems to be struggling to stand, but is not throwing punches or kicking.\n\nAnother hotel employee is seen picking up a nearby broom and striking Mitchell on the leg. The guard then punches Mitchell in the face multiple times while in the doorway of the hotel.\n\nA camera outside the hotel entrance shows Mitchell is next kicked in the face by another hotel employee before being dragged into the driveway by an employee and a guest. Footage shows the off-duty security guard throwing more punches and directing Mitchell to turn over.\n\nOnce turned over, Sulton said an employee forced Mitchell's head into the ground. He received more records from the medical examiner and provided specifics on Friday. Among the records were photos of blunt force injuries to Mitchell's head and body, including broken ribs. Sulton said the forehead injuries were caused by the four employees restraining him on the concrete.\n\n\"All of this is designed to cause physical pain,\" Sulton said. \"There's no other explanation.\"\n\nThe employees continue to hold Mitchell down and at one point an employee hits Mitchell in the head with a baton while restrained, Sulton said. The original bystander video shows that this employee said to the camera, \"This is what happens when a man goes into the ladies' room.\"\n\nThe men then held Mitchell in that position until he died.\n\nIt's unclear when an employee called police, and the Journal Sentinel has requested the time dispatch was called.\n\nSeveral employees and others were present as the incident unfolded at the Hyatt. \"I submit that we call that party to a crime in our state,\" Sulton said. \"This is just a straight up beatdown.\"\n\nSulton said other people tried to intervene but Hyatt employees threatened them.\n\n\"It's not that nobody's doing anything, it's that these people are scared,\" he said. \"People took to social media to make sure people knew what would happen and without those video footage, they absolutely would have swept this under the rug.\"\n\nThe Milwaukee Police Department referred four charges of felony murder to the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office in early July. Prosecutors have not made a charging decision.\n\nSulton said, based off the video, eight people should be charged with crimes. He said the department has been unprofessional and has lied about treating the death as a criminal matter. He specifically mentioned Police Chief Jeffrey Norman several times at Friday's news conference for prior comments he made, which he described as \"visceral.\"\n\nNorman said he wanted to \"set the record straight\" in response to Mitchell's death at a news conference just days after the death. \"If it's not something being reviewed in a criminal nature, then why is the DA looking at it? So we need to make sure that we set the record straight in regard to what's going on and who's talking in our community,\" he said.\n\nSulton said he had to take legal action to get transparency.\n\n\"The City of Milwaukee Police Department told the ME's office not to release any information, documents, or recordings to my office or the family,\" Sulton said. \"The medical examiner's office has ... its own independent legal obligations and they're simply setting those to the side and just saying we're only gonna do what the police department does. It's absolutely outrageous and it's 1,000% wrong.\n\n\"I really think that it's appalling in this particular case that this family had to go out hire a lawyer, file a case, issue a subpoena in order to get basic information. ... The police department needs to answer for why it is coddling these folks.\"\n\nSulton said it's not just the police department but private security hired by companies like Hyatt, and its operator, Aimbridge Hospitality.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is that society doesn't value all lives in the same way,\" he said. \"We have a significant problem with private security who run around like they're police and they're not. They don't have the authority to detain. They don't the authority to arrest. They don't have the authority to beat you.\"\n\nSulton said bodycam footage of the arriving officers shows interviews with the employees and witnesses. He said multiple employees lie about the events. The Journal Sentinel has not reviewed this footage.\n\nMitchell's wife, DeAsia Harmon, was overcome with emotion while watching the footage again on Friday at Sulton's law firm on North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.\n\n\"I've never forgotten what this looks like,\" she said. \"Now it's made to the public, I have to make sure my daughter doesn't see it. ... This is somebody I spent 12 years of my life with and now I have to watch his life being taken for nothing. If he was wrong, he could have went to jail.\n\n\"He was afraid. He's a big guy, if he wanted to harm somebody it wouldn't be hard. He wanted to leave.\"\n\nHarmon said she would understand restraining him nonlethally until police arrived, but \"what they did to him was excessive. They didn't have to do him like that.\"\n\n\"You have to hold so much hatred in your heart to take someone's life like that. You beat him to death.\"\n\nDrake Bentley can be reached at DBentley1@gannett.com or 414-391-5647.\n\nDavid Clarey of the Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asphyxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blunt trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norman, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norman, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/milwaukee-journal-sentinel/0295dc1d162bc3e677cf067a1b20bc90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788445", "eventUri": "eng-9788445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 485, "textEnd": 492}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Those in attendance called for first-degree murder charges against the downtown Milwaukee Hyatt Regency employees, who worked for the third-party hotel operator Aimbridge Hospitality, involved in Mitchell's death.\n\n\"We made it the first order of business to come and visit (Chisholm),\" said Kareem Ali, a community activist who led the Monday morning protest.\n\nMitchell died on June 30 after being held down by guards and employees, spurring community outrage, frequent family protests, and calls for charges to be brought against those involved. His death has brought comparisons to George Floyd, a Minneapolis Black man who was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020 and held down until he died as well.\n\nMore: Medical report offers new details on the death of D'Vontaye Mitchell, man killed outside of Hyatt\n\nMore: 'You beat him to death': What happened to D'Vontaye Mitchell at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Milwaukee comes to light\n\nThe demonstration came after the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner released Mitchell's cause of death on Friday, attributing it to asphyxiation from being held down and the \"toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine.\" That report was said to be the last hurdle for the District Attorney's office, who said in mid-July that it expected to make a \"swift decision\" once the autopsy was released.\n\nAttempts to reach Chisholm for comment Monday were not immediately successful.\n\nNayisha Mitchell, D'Vontaye's sister, and others said the family wants first-degree murder charges filed against those involved. She was frustrated by the pace of the investigation.\n\n\"You said it was going to be swift,\" she said. \"We got it back last week. You still haven't done nothing. Why are we still waiting? It's been over 30 days.\"\n\nOn Friday evening, following the release of the medical examiner's reports, Will Sulton, the attorney for Mitchell's wife and child, released previously unseen footage from inside the hotel, showing guards and a bystander dragging and beating Mitchell, among other details that show what occurred.\n\nAt the demonstration, Mitchell's mother Brenda Giles said she was unable to eat or sleep after watching the footage of the employee's dragging and striking her son.\n\n\"All I want is justice for my son,\" she said. \"I haven't seen an animal been beat like that. It messed me up.\"\n\nAt the demonstration, the fathers of Jacob Blake, a Black Kenosha man who was shot by a police officer in the back and paralyzed, and Corey Stingley, a Black teenager who died in a struggle with three white customers at a West Allis convenience store, spoke in support of the family.\n\nCraig Stingley, Corey's father, was critical of Chisholm's handling of prior cases involving Black men and called for charges. Stingley said he saw the hotel footage and it \"made no sense.\"\n\n\"It brought back to me the inhumanity, the inhumane treatment of Black people in this country,\" he said. \"It makes absolutely no sense that private citizens would take the law into their own hands and think they have the autonomy to take a man's life.\"\n\nSupporters -- which included the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and a Milwaukee representative of the Nation of Islam -- and family at the demonstration also criticized local media for their citing of Mitchell's drug use in reports and for not naming the Hyatt employees involved in his death and blurring their faces in video.\n\nOn Friday, the attorney Sulton criticized the medical examiner's office for the inclusion of drugs in the cause-of-death report.\n\n\"I think it was reckless for the medical examiner's office to write the report that way. The reason it's reckless is because it gives a false impression that it had anything to do with Mr. Mitchell's death and it did not, and they know it,\" he told the Journal Sentinel.\n\nMitchell's sister Nayisha repeated the names of the guards and called for first-degree murder charges against each during the demonstration. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel typically does not name suspects who have not been charged.\n\nNayisha said the family would continue to demonstrate until charges were filed.\n\n\"We need you to move faster. We need these people arrested. We need some charges made and we need some convictions,\" she said. \"We want first-degree murder. We don't want nothing less.\"\n\nEarlier in July, the Milwaukee Police Department referred four charges of felony murder to the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office. The District Attorney's Office said it was reviewing Mitchell's death as a homicide case on July 10.\n\nMitchell's family has protested weekly since his death, including at the Hyatt hotel, Chisholm's home and at a downtown Milwaukee police and court building.

Mitchell then ran into the women's bathroom and tried to lock himself inside while women were in there, the report said.\n\nThe women inside the bathroom screamed and two security guards went inside and removed Mitchell, according to the report.\n\nThe report added that Mitchell was reportedly combative with security guards and tried to reach into their pockets. The security guards physically struggled with Mitchell and dragged him out of the hotel through the front entrance, the report said. Two other security guards assisted, the report said, because Mitchell was combative. The guards then \"held him down on the concrete face down\" until police arrived, according to the report.\n\nBut you already know the playbook.\n\nFew stories mention the bathroom angle anymore.

An autopsy showed that asphyxiation, cocaine and methamphetamine had contributed to his death.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office announced the charge of felony murder against four people: Todd Alan Erickson, 60; Brandon Ladaniel Turner, 35; Devin W. Johnson-Carson, 23; and Herbert T. Williamson, 52. The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years and nine months.\n\nProsecutors said arrest warrants had been issued for the men, though it was unclear if they had been arrested by late Tuesday.\n\nMr. Erickson and Mr. Turner worked as security guards at the Hyatt Hotel in Milwaukee, prosecutors said. Mr. Williamson worked as a bell attendant, and Mr. Johnson-Carson worked at the front desk. All four were fired after Mr. Mitchell's death.\n\nThe charges filed in court Tuesday came after an autopsy report released on Friday ruled the death a homicide and found that Mr. Mitchell, 43, had died from a combination of \"restraint asphyxia and toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine\" as he was held down by hotel workers in a prone position on June 30. The report also noted that Mr. Mitchell had been obese and had hypertensive cardiovascular disease.\n\nLast month, the district attorney's office said it was investigating the death as a homicide. The Milwaukee Police Department had also recommended murder charges against four unnamed people last month to the district attorney.\n\nIn a statement issued Tuesday, Ben Crump, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Mitchell's family, said the charges were a \"significant step\" toward justice.\n\n\"The evidence, including security footage and witness statements, paints a disturbing picture of a man in distress who was met with excessive and lethal force,\" Mr. Crump said in a statement.\n\nVideo of the episode that circulated online appeared to show four hotel workers holding Mr. Mitchell to the ground as he could be heard calling for help.\n\nThe criminal complaint, filed Tuesday, said Mr. Mitchell could be heard yelling \"Please!\" and noted that he had made noises consistent with someone out of breath.\n\nSecurity camera footage showed that Mr. Mitchell ran into the lobby of the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee on June 30 in what appeared to be a \"frantic manner,\" the criminal complaint said.\n\nMr. Mitchell then ran into the lobby's gift shop before darting out of the shop and down the hallway into the women's restroom.\n\nTwo unidentified women who were inside the restroom said Mitchell attempted to close the bathroom door, the complaint said.\n\nSurveillance footage showed Mr. Turner, an off-duty security guard, pulling Mr. Mitchell out of the restroom and escorting him to the lobby, according to the complaint.\n\nMr. Mitchell then grabbed at the guard's waistband before Mr. Turner backed away, punched Mr. Mitchell and knocked him down, the complaint said.\n\nSurveillance footage showed that an unidentified hotel guest helped Mr. Turner drag Mr. Mitchell outside through the sliding lobby doors, where an unidentified hotel employee struck Mr. Mitchell's legs twice with a broom, knocking him to the ground. Mr. Turner is shown on the video punching Mr. Mitchell several times, according to the complaint.\n\nAs Mr. Mitchell tried to re-enter the hotel, Mr. Johnson-Carson, the front desk worker, and Mr. Erickson, the on-duty security guard, joined Mr. Turner in tackling Mr. Mitchell to the ground.\n\nMr. Turner and Mr. Johnson-Carson can be seen on video punching Mr. Mitchell, while Mr. Erickson kicks him in the torso, the complaint said.\n\nThe four men forced Mr. Mitchell onto his stomach and held him down for eight to nine minutes before the police arrived.\n\nMr. Erickson, at one point, struck Mr. Mitchell with a baton, the complaint said.\n\nThe autopsy report said Mr. Mitchell had been unresponsive as the workers waited for the police.\n\nWhen they arrived, the police administered Narcan, which is used to treat drug overdoses, and performed CPR on Mr. Mitchell until medics arrived and ultimately pronounced him dead on the scene.\n\nMr. Mitchell was found with bruises on his left knee, a hand and his lower back, the autopsy report said.\n\nHe had a T-shirt and a sweater pulled over his head, and there appeared to be dried blood on his forehead when he was found. He had a metal rod and a pipe, both with burn marks, the autopsy report said.\n\nThe police interviewed Mr. Mitchell's mother, Brenda Giles, who said he was homeless and had been recently admitted to a rehab clinic for drug use.\n\nAt least one of the charged men, Mr. Johnson-Carson, told investigators the force used on Mr. Mitchell had been excessive.\n\nMr. Johnson-Carson told investigators that he had reluctantly complied when Mr. Erickson ordered him to reapply pressure on Mr. Mitchell even though he had recognized that it was unnecessary.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asphyxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony murder rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/4-Milwaukee-Hotel-Workers-Charged-With-Murder-in-Fatal-Pinning.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788445", "eventUri": "eng-9788445", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 1479, "textEnd": 1486, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Other \"significant conditions\" contributing to the death include hypertensive cardiovascular disease and morbid obesity, the report said.\n\nSo much like George Floyd, it's actually the drugs, heart problems and weight issues, and it's being wrongly blamed on some underpaid security guards trying to keep women safe after the latest Gentle Giant locked himself in a bathroom with women.\n\nAn investigation report from the medical examiner said Mitchell entered the hotel lobby and \"appeared to be frantic and panting.\"\n\nHotel staff and guests saw him hiding behind objects in the lobby, and was told to leave by hotel staff, the report said. Mitchell then ran into the women's bathroom and tried to lock himself inside while women were in there, the report said.\n\nThe women inside the bathroom screamed and two security guards went inside and removed Mitchell, according to the report.\n\nThe report added that Mitchell was reportedly combative with security guards and tried to reach into their pockets. The security guards physically struggled with Mitchell and dragged him out of the hotel through the front entrance, the report said. Two other security guards assisted, the report said, because Mitchell was combative. The guards then \"held him down on the concrete face down\" until police arrived, according to the report.\n\nBut you already know the playbook.\n\nFew stories mention the bathroom angle anymore. They castigate hotel workers for protecting women. Hyatt fired the workers and called for them to be charged.\n\nSharpton and Ben Crump are on the scene. Millions will change hands.

Themed \u201cLearn Today, Lead Tomorrow\u201d, this year\u2019s edition, which will be for 30 days in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of MTN Group, aims to address educational disparities in underserved rural and remote communities. \u201cY\u2019ello Care is about the MTN ecosystem giving back and contributing their time, money, and resources to make a positive impact. This year, we\u2019re focusing on education in remote areas, supporting three projects that will provide access to quality education for young Nigerians,\u201d said Tobe Okigbo, chief corporate services & sustainability officer, MTN Nigeria. During the opening ceremony, which held at the headquarters, MTN revealed that in 30 days, MTN staff will come together using their resources to rebuild classroom for 996 students at Iwerekun Community High School, Lakowe, Lagos. \u201cOur first key project is a school. We\u2019ve visited the school; we\u2019ll rebuild a classroom ourselves as MTN staff and we will support two other projects. Our target is towards providing education for the youth of this country,\u201d Okigbo added. This effort seeks to bridge the educational divide and empower young people to reach their full potential. In addition, MTNers will be supporting the KNOSK Charity Education Initiative (Study Better Packs) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC)\u2019s Safe School Initiative spearheaded by the National Safe School Response Coordination Centre. \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world,\u201d Nelson Mandela famously said. MTN Nigeria firmly believes in this transformative power and is committed to providing access to quality education for all, regardless of location or circumstance. The company recognizes that education is not just about textbooks and classrooms; it\u2019s about unlocking potential, nurturing dreams, and empowering individuals to shape their own futures. This commitment is particularly crucial in Africa, where educational disparities continue to hinder progress. According to UNESCO, over one-fifth of children aged 6 to 11 in sub-Saharan Africa are out of school, representing the highest rate of educational exclusion globally. This crisis is further compounded by challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, limited access to learning materials, and a shortage of qualified teachers. In Nigeria, the situation mirrors these broader trends, with a significant portion of children in rural and remote areas facing similar obstacles to quality education. The 30-day project, which kicked off on June 1, will unite thousands of MTN employees in a shared mission to make a lasting impact on educational access and quality. MTN Nigeria remains committed to creating value through initiatives that seek to provide sustainable growth and job creation in the communities they serve.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/MTN-Yello-Care-2.webp\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/MTN-Yello-Care-2.webp 900w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/MTN-Yello-Care-2-300x199.webp 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/MTN-Yello-Care-2-768x510.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></div>MTN Nigeria has announced the 17th edition of its flagship employee volunteer initiative, Y\u2019ello Care, where MTNers have the unique opportunity to contribute their resources \u2013 time, money and more \u2013 towards worthy causes.

The Rays will have Tyler Alexander on the bump.\n\nThe White Sox have already swept the Rays in a three-game series this season. They have only won eight games all year, but three have come against the Rays. Chicago was able to hit the ball very well against the Rays, which is why they were able to sweep them. In the three games, Chicago hit .315 with an .811 OPS. The White Sox hit four home runs, and they scored 21 runs. If the White Sox can have another good offensive game against the Rays, they will be able to improve their record to 4-0 against the Rays.\n\nThe White Sox gave up just 12 earned runs against the Rays in the three games played. Their pitching has failed them a little bit this season, but it was very good against the Rays in their series. Chicago needs that to continue in this one. If the White Sox are able to pitch the ball well, and shut down a Rays offense that is not at their best, Chicago will win this game.\n\nWhy The Rays Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nTampa Bay is coming off a sweep over the New York Mets, so they are playing well. In that series, the Rays offense came alive for 20 runs. They hit nine extra base hits, and walked 19 times in those three games. This is the type of offensive play the Rays need to have in the game Monday night. If the Rays can be patient at the plate, and hit their pitches, they are going to win this game against the White Sox.\n\nThe White Sox have the worst batting average in the MLB this season, so do not expect another series like the one they had earlier in the year against the Rays. With that, the White Sox have also hit the least amount of home runs in the MLB, so they do not hit for much power. Tampa Bay should be able to keep the White Sox offense contained in this game, and the series. If they do that, the Rays will win this game.\n\nFinal White Sox-Rays Prediction & Pick\n\nYes, the White Sox have already swept the Rays this season. However, those games were on the road, and the Rays are a worse road team. Tampa Bay is over .500 at home, as well. On the other hand, the White Sox have won just three road games this season. For this game, I am going to go with the Rays spread. It is just very hard to bet on the White Sox this season, so I will not be doing that in this game.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-Sox-vs.-Rays-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

Our MLB odds series has our White Sox-Rays prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nThe White Sox make the trip to Tampa Bay to face the Rays! The White Sox have been one of the worst teams in the MLB this season, while the Rays have been inconsistent, but have shown they have talent. Our MLB odds series has our White Sox-Rays prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nThe White Sox are tied for the worst team in the MLB up to this point in the season. They have an 8-26 record but come into this game on a two-game winning streak. They are the second-worst team in the MLB behind the plate. Then, they are also struggling on the mound, ranking third to last in team ERA. Gavin Sheets, Eloy Jimenez, and Andrew Benintendi are standouts on an awful offense, while the only notable pitcher in the lineup is Erick Fedde. The White Sox have struggled this season and have not done much right at all this season.\n\nThe Rays have been inconsistent out of the gate, and currently sit with a 17-18 record, and they enter this series on a three-game winning streak. The Rays are in the top half of the league in batting average, but they have struggled on the mound in pitching. Isaac Paredes, Amed Rosario, Yandy Diaz, and Randy Arozarena have been very good for the Rays offense. On the mound, Zach Eflin, Ryan Pepiot, and Zack Littell have been good for a unit that has struggled as a whole so far this season. The Rays have a tough matchup against a team as good as the Brewers.\n\nThe White Sox are putting Michael Soroka on the mound where he has a 0-3 record, a 6.48 ERA, and a 1.62 WHIP. He has allowed 24 runs on 35 hits with 19 walks and 16 strikeouts through 33.1 innings. The White Sox have gone 1-6 in his seven appearances on the mound this season. In his last start, he pitched 4.1 innings and allowed two runs on three hits with two walks and three strikeouts in a loss. He has struggled this season and is pitching against a very good Rays offense behind the plate.\n\nThe offense for the White Sox has been the second-worst in the entire MLB. The White Sox are 29th in the MLB in team batting average at .211 after having a team batting average of .238 last season which was good for 25th. Gavin Sheets, Andrew Benintendi, and Eloy Jimenez lead the way for the offense in most categories. Sheets leads the way in batting average at .270, in OBP at .362, and in total hits at 27. Andrew Benintendi then leads the way in RBI at 13 and then Eloy Jimenez leads the way with four home runs. The White Sox have a decent matchup against Zach Eflin on the mound.\n\nWhy The Rays Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Rays are putting Zach Eflin on the mound where he has a 1-4 record, a 4.17 ERA, and a 1.17 WHIP. He has allowed 20 runs on 44 hits with four walks and 36 strikeouts through 41 innings. The Rays are 2-5 in the seven games that he's appeared in, so far this season. In his last start, he pitched 5.2 innings and allowed three runs on six hits with zero walks and six strikeouts. Eflin has a great matchup against a White Sox offense that has struggled a lot so far this season.\n\nThe offense for the Rays has been solid this season behind the plate, coming in just outside the top 10 in the MLB. They are 12th in team-batting average at .243 after finishing last season with the same average. Amed Rosario and Isaac Paredes are the main leaders for the Rays behind the plate in most batting categories. Rosario leads the way in batting average at .313 and in total hits at 36. Isaac Paredes leads the way in home runs at seven, in RBI at 18, and in OBP at .380. The Rays have a good matchup against Michael Soroka for the White Sox on the mound.\n\nFinal White Sox-Rays Prediction & Pick\n\nThe White Sox have won two straight heading into this game, but they have struggled across the board this season regardless of offense or defense. Soroka has struggled and their offense does not have much depth to keep pace with anyone this season. The Rays have been inconsistent, but they have the offense to bother the White Sox and it helps they are at home. Eflin has also been solid on the mound. Expect the Rays to win and cover at home in this spot to extend their winning streak.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Benintendi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Benintendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloy_Jim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eloy Jim\u00e9nez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Fedde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erick Fedde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amed_Rosario", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amed Rosario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Crystallography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Crystallography", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White-Sox-vs.-Rays-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Eflin also retired Sheets on a grounder with two on and two outs in the seventh.\n\nRandy Arozarena and Isaac Paredes homered for the Rays, who moved over .500 at 19-18.\n\nThe AL-worst White Sox (8-28) have dropped the first two games of the series to fall 20 games under .500, equaling a season high. Chicago swept a three-game series from the Rays at home April 26-28.\n\nArozarena put the Rays up 4-0 on a two-run homer off Michael Soroka (0-4) in the third. The 2023 AL All-Star has three homers in his last five games and has raised his batting average from .143 to .152 during the series with Chicago.\n\nHarold Ram\u00edrez had an RBI single in a two-run second.\n\nSoroka allowed four runs, three hits and four walks over five innings.\n\nParedes made it 5-0 on a solo homer off Brad Keller in the sixth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRays: RHP Ryan Pepiot, hit on the left calf by a 107.5 mph liner off the bat of Mets outfielder Starling Marte on Sunday, is scheduled to undergo another CT scan. \"Pepiot came in a little sorer than we anticipated,\" manager Kevin Cash said. ...

PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Zach Eflin allowed one run and six hits in seven innings as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Chicago White Sox 5-1 on Tuesday night for their fifth consecutive win.\n\nRandy Arozarena and Isaac Paredes homered for the Rays, who moved over .500 at 19-18.\n\nEflin (2-4) lost the shutout when Paul DeJong homered with two outs in the seventh.\n\n\"Really good stuff, really good command,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \"He was really sharp. He made some big pitches when he had to.\"\n\nThe right-hander worked out of a bases-loaded, two-out jam in the fifth by getting a flyball from Gavin Sheets on a 3-0 pitch. Eflin also retired Sheets on a grounder with two on and two outs in the seventh.\n\n\"I was kind of surprised he swung at it, but I'll take it any day,\" Eflin said of Sheets' at-bat in the fifth. \"Threw a pretty good sinker and he hit a flyball to right that got me out of the jam.\"\n\nEflin earned his first win since April 2. He lost his previous three decisions.\n\nThe AL-worst White Sox (8-28) have dropped the first two games of the series to fall 20 games under .500, equaling a season high. Chicago swept a three-game series from the Rays at home April 26-28.\n\nIt's the worst 36-game start in White Sox history.\n\n\"One thing this game teaches you is short-term memory,\" manager Pedro Grifol said. \"Regardless of whether you win or lose, you need to have short-term memory in this game. It's the only way to get through a full season.\"\n\nArozarena put the Rays up 4-0 on a two-run homer off Michael Soroka (0-4) in the third. The 2023 AL All-Star has three homers in his last five games and has raised his batting average from .143 to .152 during the series with Chicago.\n\n\"I think we're seeing a guy that is starting to feel a little bit better about himself,\" Cash said.\n\nHarold Ram\u00edrez had an RBI single in a two-run second.\n\nSoroka allowed four runs, three hits and four walks over five innings.\n\nParedes made it 5-0 on a solo homer off Brad Keller in the sixth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRays: RHP Ryan Pepiot, hit on the left calf by a 107.5 mph liner off the bat of Mets outfielder Starling Marte on Sunday, is expected to go on the injured list. \"We'll have probably more of an announcement tomorrow, but (it's) likely,\" Cash said. Pepiot had a second CT scan that showed no broken bones. ... Tampa Bay closer Pete Fairbanks (nerve-related hand issues) allowed two hits over a scoreless inning in his initial appearance with Triple-A Durham. ... 2B Brandon Lowe (right oblique strain) doubled in two at-bats in his first game with Durham.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWhite Sox RHP Chris Flexen (1-3, 4.85 ERA) and Rays RHP Aaron Civale (2-2, 6.14) are Wednesday night's starters. Civale has allowed 18 runs in 13 2/3 innings over his last three starts.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria

(AP) -- Jonny DeLuca continued his hot stretch with a homer and four RBIs, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat Mike Clevinger and the Chicago White Sox 8-2 on Monday night for their fourth consecutive win.\n\nDeLuca has driven in 10 runs in four games after being sidelined with a broken right hand all season.\n\nDeLuca had a two-run single in a three-run second against Clevinger, and hit a two-run drive off Jared Shuster during a three-run fifth that made it 7-2.\n\nClevinger (0-1) was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte before the game, and allowed four runs, six hits and four walks without a strikeout over two-plus innings in his season debut.\n\nClevinger got a late start this season after finalizing a $3 million, one-year contract on April 4.

Jonny DeLuca delivered the walk-off victory with a two-run triple in the 10th inning and finished 2-for-4 with three RBIs.\n\nDeLuca made his Tampa Bay debut Friday after being out with a broken hand sustained when he was hit by a pitch on March 10. In three games, he is 3-for-11 with two runs, two steals and six RBIs.\n\n\"He was a guy that we really were excited about in spring training when he broke the hand,\" manager Kevin Cash said. \"... We talk about guys that are like baseball players, he certainly presents that. He's going to go up and have good at-bats, he's going to steal a base when he needs to, he's going to do a lot of things to help you win.\"\n\nTampa Bay's offense came alive against the Mets, scoring 20 runs after managing just six in their previous four games combined. Prior to the series, the team had lost eight of 10 games.\n\n\"We've been struggling a little bit,\" Randy Arozarena, whose solo home run with two outs in the ninth forced extra innings, said through a translator. \"It's good to come out and work hard and stay positive out there. And as you can see, the team really needed it.\"\n\nNow the Rays aim to avenge being swept by the White Sox as they were a week ago, a three-game series in which Chicago outscored them 21-13.\n\nWhile Tampa Bay not officials have not announced their starting pitcher for Monday, Tyler Alexander (1-1, 5.02 ERA) is expected to be on the mound, either as a starter or following an opener. The left-hander is 1-5 with a 4.52 ERA in 19 career appearances (nine starts) against the White Sox.\n\nChicago arrives in Tampa Bay fresh off a series win against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nEloy Jimenez broke a 1-1 tie with a home run to lead off the seventh inning. The blast ignited a four-run burst that carried the White Sox to a 5-1 triumph.\n\nHis four home runs lead the team.\n\n\"If you see back at home and in Minnesota, they were pitching me away and I was unavailable to hit that ball,\" Jimenez said. \"So to stay that way, that was in '19, too, the most homers I hit and pretty much all my homers went to the other side. So hitting the ball that way means I'm getting better.\"\n\nDespite winning two straight, the White Sox remain tied for last overall in wins in the majors with eight. Their run differential is the worst at minus-82, and they were outscored 19-12 in three losses to the Minnesota Twins before the series in St. Louis.\n\nSunday's win against was also just the second time Chicago won a game by more than two runs. The other was its 9-4 victory in the series opener against the Rays on April 26.\n\nWhile the White Sox had not confirmed who Monday's starting pitcher will be, indications were that Mike Clevinger could make his season debut. Clevinger, who was 9-9 with a 3.77 ERA in 24 starts for the White Sox last season, re-signed with the team in early April.\n\nIn three appearances against the Rays, two as a starter, Clevinger is 1-0 with a 1.46 ERA and 18 strikeouts covering 12 1/3 innings. The most recent of those appearances was a start on April 30, 2023, when he took a no-decision after allowing two runs on seven hits with one walk and eight strikeouts in five innings.\n\n--Field

PETERSBURG -- It wasn't just the uniforms. The Rays looked like a completely different team against the White Sox on Monday night.\n\nA week after Chicago swept Tampa Bay in the Windy City, which was a low point in a rough start to the season, the Rays dominated the White Sox 8-2 in front of an announced crowd of 12,042 at Tropicana Field.\n\nThe Rays (18-18) extended their winning streak to a season-high four games and got a little revenge.\n\nThey also wore their dark gray and neon City Connect jerseys for an unexpected fourth straight day at the players' request.\n\nIn a game of superstition, the players are begging to wear them every game.\n\n\"These jerseys are sick,\" Jonny DeLuca said. \"They're undefeated, so hopefully we keep them going.\"\n\nBut more important than the specialty uniforms, which originally were only for last weekend and a few select Saturday games the rest of the season, the Rays had a different lineup and vibe.\n\nDeLuca, who walked off a win Sunday, came back from starting the year on the injured list Friday and in four games with the Rays has driven in 10 runs. Monday night, DeLuca had a two-run single and a two-run home run for a career-high four RBIs.\n\n\"I believe he's undefeated as a Ray,\" Josh Lowe said. \"That's pretty cool. He's swinging the bat well, even when I was with him in Durham -- when we were in rehab -- he looked great swinging the bat there, too. So it's just cool to see him have some success early.\"\n\nLowe was back in the lineup Monday night as well.\n\nIt was DeLuca's third career homer and first since July 22, 2023, at Texas with the Dodgers. His 10 RBIs are the most through a player's first four games with the Rays in club history. And they're the most through a Rays hitter's first four games of a season, surpassing Evan Longoria, who had eight in 2009.\n\nThe last player in the majors with 10 or more RBIs in his first four games with a new club was, coincidentally, former Ray and Josh Lowe's brother, Nathaniel, in 2021 for Texas.\n\nDeLuca's 10 RBIs are the most by a Ray over any four-game span since Brandon Lowe recorded 10 from April 8-11, 2023.\n\n\"That's pretty impressive. I mean, the home run was impressive,\" manager Kevin Cash said. \"I liked the two-strike shot to right on a ground ball.\"\n\nDeLuca, acquired with Ryan Pepiot in the trade that sent Tyler Glasnow to the Dodgers, already has surpassed his RBI total for last season (six in 24 big-league games).\n\n\"Timing, timing is all good. Yeah, it's fun to go out there and play with these guys and obviously a winning atmosphere, so I'm just doing my thing and everyone's contributing,\" DeLuca said. \"So it's fun.\"\n\nJosh Lowe had two hits in his season debut after dealing with oblique and hamstring issues this spring. Harold Ramirez had a career high-tying four hits (including a double), drove in a run and scored three times, also tying a career high.\n\n\"We want a lot of these guys to feel good in the batter's box, feel good about themselves and ... [Harold had] two soft-hit balls and two balls he squared up really, really well,\" Cash said. \"So encouraged by that.\"\n\nThere was a lot for the Rays to feel good about Monday night. Randy Arozarena doubled and walked twice. Each of his last five hits have been for extra bases. Amed Rosario hit his second triple of the season, and Ben Rortvedt had his first RBI since April 24.\n\nTyler Alexander went four innings, allowing two runs, both on Tommy Pham's third-inning home run. The White Sox (8-27) had four hits off him, he walked one and struck out a season-high seven. Erasmo Ramirez pitched three hitless innings with just one walk to earn his second straight win.\n\nThe four-game winning streak got the Rays back to .500 and the clubhouse feeling good. They were already talking about wearing the City Connect jerseys again on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're not taking them off,\" Ramirez said. \"We're going to wear them all season.\"", "source": {"uri":

PETERSBURG -- Chris Flexen pitched six sharp innings, Paul DeJong homered again and the Chicago White Sox avoided their seventh sweep this season by beating the Tampa Bay Rays 4-1 on Wednesday night.\n\nThe AL-worst White Sox (9-28) won the season series 4-2. Chicago swept a three-game home set with the Rays from April 26-28.\n\n\"Clean baseball all the way around.\" Chicago manager Pedro Grifol said. \"Opportunistic hitting. Really good pitching.\"\n\nFlexen (2-3) struck out eight while surrendering one run and three hits. The right-hander tossed five scoreless innings in a 9-4 win over Tampa Bay on April 26.\n\n\"He has kind of had our number,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \"He's kept us off balance quite a bit. Mixed very well against us and kind of given us fits.\"\n\nFlexen walked one.\n\n\"Just trying to be consistent,\" Flexen said. \"Every time I go out there I'm always trying to put us in position to win. My game is command the zone, try to minimize the walks.\"\n\nMichael Kopech, the third Chicago reliever, handled the ninth for his third save in four chances, finishing a four-hitter.\n\nDeJong hit a two-run drive off Aaron Civale (2-3) in the fifth, lifting the White Sox to a 2-1 lead. He also went deep during Tuesday night's 5-1 loss.\n\nCivale was pulled in the fifth inning for the fourth consecutive start. The right-hander was charged with two runs and five hits. The Rays saw their five-game winning streak come to en end.\n\n\"It's probably more coincidence than anything,\" Cash said.\n\nHe has pitched five innings or less in 13 of 18 starts since being acquired from Cleveland at last year's trade deadline.\n\nCivale was replaced by Kevin Kelly with two on and two outs. Andrew Vaughn then reached on an infield single, loading the bases, but Eloy Jim\u00e9nez struck out looking.\n\nSixth-inning RBI singles by Bryan Ramos and Tommy Pham lifted Chicago to a 4-1 lead.\n\nRamos is hitting .357 (5 for 14) in five games since being called up from Double-A Birmingham on Saturday. His double in the two-run fifth hit off the wall in left and just missed becoming his first big league homer.\n\n\"Two more pushups, and that's a homer,\" Ramos said with a smile.\n\nFlexen retired his first nine batters before Yandy D\u00edaz opened the fourth with a single and scored on Isaac Paredes' double.

It is time to continue our MLB odds series with a White Sox-Rays prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox continue on their road trip Wednesday evening for a clash with the Tampa Bay Rays. The White Sox look to bounce back after a tough loss, with Chris Flexen on the mound seeking to contain the Rays' patient offense. The Rays, always a threat at home, counter with Aaron Civale. Expect a classic pitcher's duel with both teams relying on their pitching staff to shut down the other's bats as the White Sox look to get some momentum before leaving Tampa Bay in this Wednesday night matchup.\n\nThe Trop gets electric Wednesday night as the Tampa Bay Rays face the visiting Chicago White Sox! The Rays, boasting a stingy pitching staff led by Aaron Civale, aim to shut down the White Sox' bats and extend their home winning streak. Chris Flexen counters for Chicago. The Tampa Bay Rays will be looking to continue their hot streak at the plate and on the mound when they welcome the White Sox to Tropicana Field for game three of this series in this Wednesday night matchup.\n\nTV: Bally Sports Sun, NBC Sports Chicago, MLB Extra Innings\n\nWednesday night's matchup at Tropicana Field pits the Chicago White Sox, hungry for a win, against the Tampa Bay Rays and their rising star Aaron Civale. While the Rays are a force to be reckoned with at home, the White Sox, with Chris Flexen on the mound, have the potential to pull off an upset on the road.\n\nFlexen, a blossoming right-hander, has quietly been a dependable arm for the White Sox this season. He throws a mix of pitches that keeps hitters guessing, featuring a deceptive changeup that complements his fastball nicely. His ability to locate effectively and limit walks has resulted in a solid 4-3 record and a 3.62 ERA. More importantly, he thrives under pressure, pitching with poise in key situations.\n\nOn the other hand, Civale, despite showcasing flashes of brilliance, can be streaky at times. While his fastball has good zip and his curveball can buckle knees, he's prone to command issues that can inflate his pitch count. The White Sox' lineup, boasting veterans like Jose Abreu and Tim Anderson, can capitalize on any mistakes Civale makes and force him out of the game early.\n\nThe White Sox' offense seems to be waking up after a sluggish start. Their aggressive approach at the plate, coupled with Flexen's ability to keep the Rays in check, could create an opportunity for Chicago to steal a victory on the road. The key for the White Sox lies in putting together quality at-bats against Civale and capitalizing on any scoring opportunities early.\n\nThis matchup presents a fascinating contrast: a surging Flexen looking to solidify his role in the White Sox rotation, facing a talented but sometimes inconsistent Civale. While the Tropicana Field environment can favor the Rays, the White Sox's offensive potential and Flexen's recent form give them a fighting chance. If they can jump on Civale early and limit baserunners, Chicago can silence the Rays' crowd and secure a much-needed win.\n\nWhy The Rays Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays return to the friendly confines of Tropicana Field on Wednesday night, looking to overpower the visiting Chicago White Sox with Aaron Civale on the mound. While Chris Flexen has been a pleasant surprise for the White Sox, the combination of Civale's talent and the Rays' aggressive offense positions Tampa Bay for a victory on their home turf.\n\nCivale, a young righty with a bright future, possesses a diverse arsenal that can baffle hitters. His fastball features good movement, and his curveball has the potential to drop hitters to their knees. While he can be prone to walks at times, Civale thrives at home, where the Trop's unique dimensions can work to his advantage. Look for him to use his pinpoint control to exploit the White Sox' tendency to strike out.\n\nOn the other side, Chris Flexen, despite his recent improvement, presents a more exploitable matchup for the Rays' potent offense. His fastball lacks overpowering velocity, and his off-speed pitches haven't always been as sharp. The Rays' hitters, led by the ever-dangerous Randy Arozarena and the patient Brandon Lowe, can take advantage of any mistakes Flexen makes and force him to work hard early in the count.\n\nFurthermore, the Tropicana Field can be a graveyard for opposing hitters. The quirky dimensions and the \"roof effect\" can suppress home runs and create a haven for pitchers like Civale who rely on control and deception. The Rays, accustomed to their home environment, should feel comfortable at the plate while Flexen might struggle to adjust.\n\nThe Rays' bullpen, boasting the shutdown arm of Diego Castillo, is well-rested and ready to protect a lead late in the game. This experience edge could prove crucial against a White Sox team that sometimes struggles to manufacture runs in the later innings, especially in unfamiliar territory.\n\nWhile Flexen has been a bright spot for the White Sox, facing a talented Civale and a hungry Rays lineup at home presents a significant challenge. The combination of Civale's well-rounded pitching, the Rays' offensive firepower, and the Tropicana Field advantage makes Tampa Bay the favorite on Wednesday night. Look for the Rays to capitalize on their home-field edge and Flexen's vulnerabilities to secure a convincing victory.\n\nFinal White Sox-Rays Prediction & Pick\n\nThis should be an exciting matchup between two teams full of young talent. The Atlanta Braves boast one of the more potent lineups in the majors and is going to give up-and-coming hurler Ketter Crawford a ton of problems, especially in hitter-friendly Truist Park. It's up to Reynaldo Lopez to limit the damage on his side and if he can do so expect the Braves to pounce on Crawford and get a much-needed home victory to cut into the Phillies lead atop of the NL East.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com",

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Chris Flexen's arm and Paul DeJong's bat prevented the Chicago White Sox from being swept for the seventh time this season and clinch a season series win in the process.\n\nFlexen pitched six sharp innings, DeJong homered for the second straight game and the White Sox avoided a sweep by beating the Tampa Bay Rays, 4-1, on Wednesday night at Tropicana Field.\n\nThe American League-worst White Sox (9-28) won the season series, 4-2. Chicago swept a three-game home set with the Rays from April 26-28.\n\n\"Clean baseball all the way around,\" White Sox manager Pedro Grifol said. \"Opportunistic hitting, really good pitching.\"\n\nThe White Sox return to Guaranteed Rate Field on Thursday night to open a four-game series with the AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians.\n\nFlexen impresses\n\nFlexen (2-3) struck out eight while surrendering one run and three hits Wednesday. The right-hander tossed five scoreless innings in a 9-4 win over Tampa Bay on April 26.\n\n\"He has kind of had our number,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \"He's kept us off-balance quite a bit. Mixed very well against us and kind of given us fits.\"\n\nFlexen walked just one.\n\n\"Just trying to be consistent,\" Flexen said. \"Every time I go out there I'm always trying to put us in position to win. My game is command the zone, try to minimize the walks.\"\n\nMichael Kopech, the third Chicago reliever, handled the ninth for his third save in four chances, finishing a four-hitter.\n\nDeJong hit a two-run drive off Aaron Civale (2-3) in the fifth, lifting the White Sox to a 2-1 lead. He also went deep during Tuesday night's 5-1 loss.\n\nCivale was pulled in the fifth inning for the fourth consecutive start. The right-hander was charged with two runs and five hits.\n\n\"It's probably more coincidence than anything,\" Cash said.\n\nHe has pitched five innings or less in 13 of 18 starts since being acquired from Cleveland at last year's trade deadline.\n\nCivale was replaced by Kevin Kelly with two on and two outs. Andrew Vaughn then reached on an infield single, loading the bases, but Eloy Jim\u00e9nez struck out looking.\n\nSixth-inning RBI singles by Bryan Ramos and Tommy Pham lifted Chicago to a 4-1 lead.\n\nRamos is hitting .357 (5-for-14) in five games since being called up from Double-A Birmingham on Saturday. His double in the two-run fifth hit off the wall in left and just missed becoming his first big-league homer.\n\n\"Two more pushups, and that's a homer,\" Ramos said with a smile.\n\nFlexen retired his first nine batters before Yandy D\u00edaz opened the fourth with a single and scored on Isaac Paredes' double. All three Tampa Bay hits off of him came in the inning.\n\nTrainer's room\n\nWhite Sox: Grifol said OF Luis Robert Jr. (right hip flexor strain) has bounced back from a setback earlier this week. ...

PETERSBURG, Fla. - The wins, of course, are the most important thing, and the Rays on Tuesday extended their streak to five straight with a 5-1 victory over the White Sox at Tropicana Field.\n\nThe City Connect uniforms have gotten a nice bump in attention, as the Rays' fortunes turned with Friday's debut of the gray-and-back, neon-accented, skateboard-themed threads and have taken them off only to be washed.\n\nBut it also matters, in a very good way, how the Rays are getting there, which is by playing much better baseball and getting contributions from throughout the roster.\n\nTuesday, that was a dominant seven-inning start by Zach Eflin, who logged his first win in more than a month. Also:\n\n- A home run from a warming Randy Arozarena, who went deep for the third time in his last five games and nudged his average to .152.\n\n- A home run by Isaac Paredes, pushing his team-leading total to eight and extending his own hot streak.\n\n- And another clutch hit by Harold Ramirez, who had a career-high-matching four on Monday.\n\nThe win improved the Rays to 19-18, the first time they've been over .500 since April 21.\n\nIt also sets them up for a payback sweep of the White Sox who, despite going into the April 26-28 series with a majors-low three wins, took three straight in Chicago.\n\nThe Rays' two-run rally in the second off Sox starter Michael Soroka started when Paredes led off with a single and Richie Palacios walked. Ramirez delivered an RBI single. Jonny DeLuca walked to load the bases, and Palacios scored when Ben Rortvedt grounded into a double play.\n\nThe Rays doubled the margin in the third, when Yandy Diaz reached on an error by shortstop Paul DeJong and Arozarena capped a nine-pitch at-bat that started with two swing-and-misses with a 363-foot homer to left.\n\nParedes made it 5-0 when he led off the sixth with a homer, like all of his others, to left. It also came on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, this one 404 feet.\n\nEflin allowed one run, on a DeJong homer, with two outs in the seventh, then gave up back-to-back singles before retiring Gavin Sheets on his 94th and final pitch of the night. Phil Maton and Manuel Rodriguez finished.", "source": {"uri": "thenewstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marc_topkin@thenewstribune.com", "name": "Marc Topkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropicana_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropicana Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ram\u00edrez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harold Ram\u00edrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Rortvedt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Rortvedt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Sheets", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Sheets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Maton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Maton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_DeJong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul DeJong"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Classical_Studies/Greek", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Classical Studies/Greek", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.thenewstribune.com/wps/build/images/thenewstribune/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "dateEnd": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 1211, "textEnd": 1222}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 1114, "textEnd": 1122}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Chicago swept a three-game home set with the Rays from April 26-28.\n\nFlexen (2-3) struck out eight while surrendering one run and three hits. The right-hander tossed five scoreless innings in a 9-4 win over Tampa Bay on April 26.\n\nMichael Kopech, the third Chicago reliever, handled the ninth for his third save in four chances, finishing a four-hitter.\n\nDeJong hit a two-run drive off Aaron Civale (2-3) in the fifth, lifting the White Sox to a 2-1 lead. He also went deep during Tuesday night's 5-1 loss.\n\nCivale was pulled in the fifth inning for the fourth consecutive start. The right-hander was charged with two runs and five hits.\n\nHe has pitched five innings or less in 13 of 18 starts since being acquired from Cleveland at last year's trade deadline.\n\nCivale was replaced by Kevin Kelly with two on and two outs. Andrew Vaughn then reached on an infield single, loading the bases, but Eloy Jim\u00e9nez struck out looking.\n\nSixth-inning RBI singles by Bryan Ramos and Tommy Pham lifted Chicago to a 4-1 lead.\n\nFlexen retired his first nine batters before Yandy D\u00edaz opened the fourth with a single and scored on Isaac Paredes' double.

DeJong then scorched his fifth homer on a drive to left, a 400-foot blast to make it 2-1 and give the visitors their first lead in the series.\n\nIn the sixth against reliever Kevin Kelly, Benintendi doubled and Ramos delivered an RBI single to right for a 3-1 advantage. After a fielder's choice at home and a strikeout, Pham lined an RBI single to center to move the lead to three runs.\n\nThe Rays threatened with runners on first and second in the seventh with one out, but a fly ball by pinch hitter Josh Lowe resulted in a double play after Paredes went to third on the play.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@thestate.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Civale", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Civale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_DeJong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul DeJong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Pham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Pham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Benintendi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Benintendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kopech", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Kopech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/aj46y9/picture288426907/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2649dfeb-8b3e-4619-9c5f-52ed9754124f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- If it happened once or twice, you might think it was just a coincidence, or a couple of bad pitches.\n\nBut Wednesday was the fourth straight start in which Aaron Civale got himself into trouble and knocked out of the game in the fifth inning.\n\nThat would make for a pattern.\n\nAnd something of a problem for the Rays.\n\nThey went on to lose to the White Sox, 4-1, snapping a season-high five-game winning streak, ending the undefeated debut of their City Connect uniforms, and dropping back to .500 at 19-19.\n\nThe Rays, using an all-right-handed hitting lineup to offset the better-against-lefties effectiveness of Sox starter Chris Flexen, didn't do much offensively, managing just three hits in six innings off him, and four total for the night.\n\nThey got their first hit when Yandy Diaz led off the fourth with a single, and a run with one out as Harold Ramirez singled and Isaac Paredes doubled. But the rally died quickly as Amed Rosario lined out and Ramirez was doubled off third.\n\nThe Rays had a bit of a rally going in the seventh with a pair of walks around a fly out. But as pinch-hitter Josh Lowe flied to right for the second out, Paredes broke from second and was standing on third when the Sox doubled him off second.\n\nAnd not much else.\n\nCivale worked quickly through the first three innings, and got out of a two-on jam in the fourth.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBut the fifth proved to be his undoing again.\n\nCivale allowed a 101.5-mph leadoff double to Bryan Ramos on a 77-mph curveball, then a 104.2-mph, 400-foot home run to Paul DeJong on an 87.1-mph cutter on an 0-1 count, putting the Sox ahead 2-1.\n\nHe got the next two out, Braden Shewmake on a grounder and Martin Maldonado by strikeout.\n\nBut there was more trouble ahead. Ex-Ray Tommy Pham laced a 100.8-mph single off an 81.5-mph sweeper and Gavin Sheets walked on six pitches. That was enough for manager Kevin Cash, who went to the mound and ended Civale's night at 82 pitches.\n\nKevin Kelly got the Rays out of that mess, but then gave up two runs in the sixth, extending the White Sox lead to 4-1.\n\nCivale, acquired at last season's trade deadline, had gotten off to a good start this season (2-1, 2.74 ERA) in his first four outings, working six innings three times and five the other.\n\nBut his last four have been similarly bad, as he allowed five earned runs over 4 2/3 innings April 21 at the Yankees, six over 4 1/3 on April 27 at the White Sox, seven over 4 2/3 on Friday against the Mets, and the two over 4 2/3 Wednesday.\n\nThe Rays had won five straight since debuting the gray and black, neon-accented, skateboard-themed new uniforms.\n\n\u00a92024 Tampa Bay Times.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Chicago White Sox starter Chris Flexen had his sharpest outing of the season against the Tampa Bay Rays on April 26 at Guaranteed Rate Field, pitching five-plus scoreless innings.\n\nThe right-hander saw the Rays again Wednesday at Tropicana Field and had another impressive start.\n\nFlexen allowed one run on three hits in six innings, pitching the Sox to a 4-1 victory in front of 12,877.\n\n\"I had a little life in the fastball and we were able to utilize that,\" Flexen said. \"We were trying to avoid a sweep and we got it done.\"\n\nFlexen had a season-high eight strikeouts as the Sox (9-28) salvaged the finale of the three-game series.\n\nFlexen has a 1.61 ERA in his last five appearances (three starts).\n\n\"He was 92-94 (mph), touching 95 maybe, and when his velocity is up like that, he's tough to hit,\" manager Pedro Grifol said.\n\nFlexen is 2-0 with a 0.82 ERA in his two starts against the Rays this season.\n\n\"Definitely have to make adjustments, if needed,\" Flexen said of seeing the Rays again. \"(Catcher Mart\u00edn Maldonado) did an awesome job of not falling into any patterns. We still utilized the same game plan. I had a different fastball, so we were able to utilize that a little better tonight.\"\n\nFlexen averages 91.3 mph on his fastball, according to MLB Statcast. He averaged 93 mph on Wednesday.\n\nHe retired the first nine batters before Yandy D\u00edaz began the fourth with a single. D\u00edaz scored on a double Isaac Paredes. The hit gave the Rays runners on second and third with one out.\n\nThe Sox brought the infield in and Amed Rosario smoked a line drive that was caught by shortstop Paul DeJong.\n\nHarold Ram\u00edrez, the runner on third, took off for home and was easily doubled up.\n\n\"The infield's in and you're hoping for weak contact,\" Flexen said. \"It was barreled and luckily went right at (DeJong) and we doubled them off.\"\n\nDeJong also made an impact at the plate, hitting a two-run home run off Rays starter Aaron Civale to give the Sox a 2-1 lead in the fifth.\n\nThe Sox scored two more runs in the next inning with RBI singles by Bryan Ramos and Tommy Pham, going ahead 4-1.\n\nThe Sox still had the three-run lead in the seventh when the Rays made another base-running blunder. Tampa Bay had runners on first and second with one out and Josh Lowe batting as the tying run.\n\nThe pinch hitter lofted a fly ball to right field. Gavin Sheets ran a long way, made a nice catch and then threw to second to double off Paredes, who had raced to third when the ball was still in the air.\n\n\"I got a good read on it,\" Sheets said. \"I was in the right-center gap, could tell (Lowe) got it off the end a little bit and just took off. Luckily it stayed up in the air long enough.\n\n\"I saw (Paredes) rounding third. I was a little confused at first, but I threw it to second and got the double play there, which is great.\"\n\nThe Sox got a conventional double play of the 4-6-3 variety in the ninth to wrap up a six-game trip with a 3-3 mark.\n\n\"Tampa's playing really well and St. Louis is getting it going as well, they've got some great pitching,\" Sheets said. \"To go 3-3 this series, it's a step in the right direction.\n\n\"It's not fully where we want to be, but it's a step in the right direction and that's what you've got to take right now.

PETERSBURG, Fla. - If it happened once or twice, you might think it was just a coincidence, or a couple of bad pitches.\n\nBut Wednesday was the fourth straight start in which Aaron Civale got himself into trouble and knocked out of the game in the fifth inning.\n\nThey went on to lose to the White Sox, 4-1, snapping a season-high five-game winning streak, ending the undefeated debut of their City Connect uniforms, and dropping back to .500 at 19-19.\n\nThe Rays, using an all-right-handed hitting lineup to offset the better-against-lefties effectiveness of Sox starter Chris Flexen, didn't do much offensively, managing just three hits in six innings off him, and four total for the night.\n\nThey got their first hit when Yandy Diaz led off the fourth with a single, and a run with one out as Harold Ramirez singled and Isaac Paredes doubled. But the rally died quickly as Amed Rosario lined out and Ramirez was doubled off third.\n\nThe Rays had a bit of a rally going in the seventh with a pair of walks around a fly out. But as pinch-hitter Josh Lowe flied to right for the second out, Paredes broke from second and was standing on third when the Sox doubled him off second.\n\nAnd not much else.\n\nCivale worked quickly through the first three innings, and got out of a two-on jam in the fourth.\n\nBut the fifth proved to be his undoing again.\n\nCivale allowed a 101.5-mph leadoff double to Bryan Ramos on a 77-mph curveball, then a 104.2-mph, 400-foot home run to Paul DeJong on an 87.1-mph cutter on an 0-1 count, putting the Sox ahead 2-1.\n\nHe got the next two out, Braden Shewmake on a grounder and Martin Maldonado by strikeout.\n\nBut there was more trouble ahead. Ex-Ray Tommy Pham laced a 100.8-mph single off an 81.5-mph sweeper and Gavin Sheets walked on six pitches. That was enough for manager Kevin Cash, who went to the mound and ended Civale's night at 82 pitches.\n\nKevin Kelly got the Rays out of that mess, but then gave up two runs in the sixth, extending the White Sox lead to 4-1.\n\nCivale, acquired at last season's trade deadline, had gotten off to a good start this season (2-1, 2.74 ERA) in his first four outings, working six innings three times and five the other.\n\nBut his last four have been similarly bad, as he allowed five earned runs over 4 2/3 innings April 21 at the Yankees, six over 4 1/3 on April 27 at the White Sox, seven over 4 2/3 on Friday against the Mets, and the two over 4 2/3 Wednesday.\n\nThe Rays had won five straight since debuting the gray and black, neon-accented, skateboard-themed new uniforms.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marc_topkin@sacbee.com", "name": "Marc Topkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Civale", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Civale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ram\u00edrez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harold Ram\u00edrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amed_Rosario", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amed Rosario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Sheets", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Sheets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Pham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Pham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_Maldonado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn Maldonado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_DeJong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul DeJong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Ramos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.

He gave up three runs (two earned) and four hits in 5 1/3 innings in his only other start against Tampa Bay, a no-decision on July 29, 2020.\n\nHe has also allowed seven homers, including at least one in every start but his most recent one. Soroka gave up two runs on three hits and two walks in 4 1/3 innings against the Minnesota Twins last Tuesday.\n\nGrifol added right-hander Brad Keller to the rotation over the weekend in the series

He said the decision on the funky uniforms that feature a devil ray logo on the hat is an easy one.\n\n\"We've got to keep using them to the 162nd game,\" Arozarena said.\n\nWith his club seeking its second consecutive sweep and season-high sixth straight victory, manager Kevin Cash said the level of play has increased.\n\n\"It feels like we've turned the dial or the volume up with the intensity and the energy,\" he said. \"I'm impressed that it carried over from a big series with (the Mets), loud crowds and make sure we've been able to continue playing good baseball these last two games.\"\n\nCash said pitcher Ryan Pepiot, who was hit in the left leg Sunday by a line drive from New York's Starling Marte, will head to the injured list.\n\nThat could line up Taj Bradley to make his season debut in Friday's series opener at home against the New York Yankees.\n\nOn Wednesday, right-hander Aaron Civale (2-2, 6.14 ERA) will pitch for the Rays in the series finale against the White Sox. He is looking to regain his form from earlier in 2024.\n\nIn his last three starts, Civale has allowed five, six and seven earned runs, respectively. The six-spot came at the expense of White Sox in a no-decision on April 27.\n\nCivale is 5-3 with a 4.91 ERA in 11 career starts against Chicago.\n\nTommy Pham and Paul DeJong have been the most productive players in the series for the once-again struggling White Sox. Pham expects to be back in the lineup after having Tuesday off.\n\nAccording to manager Pedro Grifol, that is the plan with the 36-year-old Pham.\n\n\"I'm just giving him a break,\" Grifol said at the end of April. \"I mean, he didn't have a spring training. He ran hard for three days. Everything he does is 100 percent. From the time he gets in here to the very last pitch of the game, he goes hard. So not having a spring training, I got to protect him, as well.\"'\n\nPham homered in Monday's 8-2 loss and is hitting .282 (11-for-39) in 10 games this season.\n\nChris Flexen (1-3, 4.85 ERA) will try to salvage a win for Chicago on Wednesday.

PETERSBURG -- The wins, of course, are the most important thing, and the Rays on Tuesday extended their streak to five straight with a 5-1 victory over the White Sox at Tropicana Field.\n\nThe City Connect uniforms have gotten a nice bump in attention, as the Rays' fortunes turned with Friday's debut of the gray-and-back, neon-accented, skateboard-themed threads and have taken them off only to be washed.\n\nBut it also matters, in a very good way, how the Rays are getting there, which is by playing much better baseball and getting contributions from throughout the roster.\n\nTuesday, that was a dominant seven-inning start by Zach Eflin, who logged his first win in more than a month. Also:\n\n* A home run from a warming Randy Arozarena, who went deep for the third time in his last five games and nudged his average to .152.\n\n* A home run by Isaac Paredes, pushing his team-leading total to eight and extending his own hot streak.\n\n* And another clutch hit by Harold Ramirez, who had a career-high-matching four on Monday.\n\nThe win improved the Rays to 19-18, the first time they've been over .500 since April 21.\n\nIt also sets them up for a payback sweep of the White Sox who, despite going into the April 26-28 series with a majors-low three wins, took three straight in Chicago.\n\nThe Rays' two-run rally in the second off Sox starter Michael Soroka started when Paredes led off with a single and Richie Palacios walked. Ramirez delivered an RBI single. Jonny DeLuca walked to load the bases, and Palacios scored when Ben Rortvedt grounded into a double play.\n\nThe Rays doubled the margin in the third, when Yandy Diaz reached on an error by shortstop Paul DeJong and Arozarena capped a nine-pitch at-bat that started with two swing-and-misses with a 363-foot homer to left.\n\nParedes made it 5-0 when he led off the sixth with a homer, like all of his others, to left. It also came on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, this one 404 feet.\n\nEflin allowed one run, on a DeJong homer, with two outs in the seventh, then gave up back-to-back singles before retiring Gavin Sheets on his 94th and final pitch of the night. Phil Maton and Manuel Rodriguez finished.\n\n* * *\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

PETERSBURG -- If it happened once or twice, you might think it was just a coincidence, or a couple of bad pitches.\n\nBut Wednesday was the fourth straight start in which Aaron Civale got himself into trouble and knocked out of the game in the fifth inning.\n\nThey went on to lose to the White Sox 4-1, snapping a season-high five-game winning streak, ending the undefeated debut of their City Connect uniforms, and dropping back to .500 at 19-19.\n\nThe Rays, using an all-right-handed hitting lineup to offset the better-against-lefties effectiveness of Sox starter Chris Flexen, didn't do much offensively, managing just three hits in six innings off him, and four total for the night.\n\nThey got their first hit when Yandy Diaz led off the fourth with a single, and a run with one out as Harold Ramirez singled and Isaac Paredes doubled. But the rally died quickly as Amed Rosario lined out and Ramirez was doubled off third.\n\nThe Rays had a bit of a rally going in the seventh with a pair of walks around a fly out. But as pinch-hitter Josh Lowe flied to right for the second out, Paredes broke from second and was standing on third when the Sox doubled him off second.\n\nAnd not much else.\n\nCivale worked quickly through the first three innings, and got out of a two-on jam in the fourth.\n\nBut the fifth proved to be his undoing again.\n\nCivale allowed a 101.5-mph leadoff double to Bryan Ramos on a 77-mph curveball, then a 104.2-mph, 400-foot home run to Paul DeJong on an 87.1-mph cutter on an 0-1 count, putting the Sox ahead 2-1.\n\nHe got the next two out, Braden Shewmake on a grounder and Martin Maldonado by strikeout.\n\nBut there was more trouble ahead.

Paredes, who was 3-for-4, clubbed his team-leading eighth long ball in the sixth.\n\nIn a strong start, Eflin (2-4) spun six scoreless innings before yielding a solo homer to Paul DeJong in the seventh. The right-hander allowed six hits while fanning three, all looking, without a walk in seven frames.\n\nSizzling Jonny DeLuca was 2-for-3 with a double and a walk for Tampa Bay, which moved a game above .500 and stayed perfect on its nine-game homestand with its season-long fifth straight win.\n\nDeJong and Korey Lee had two hits apiece as Chicago managed just six, five for singles.\n\nPlagued by control problems yet again, starter Michael Soroka (0-4) allowed four runs (three earned) on three hits while walking and whiffing four apiece.\n\nFor the fifth straight game, the Rays donned their dark City Connect uniforms after winning in them in the first four outings starting Friday.\n\nAfter going 4-for-4 in Monday's 8-2 win, Harold Ramirez stayed hot in the duds, stroking an RBI single to plate Paredes in the second. Ben Rortvedt made it 2-0 when he grounded into a double play to bring in Richie Palacios.\n\nAfter shortstop DeJong committed his fifth error of the season in the third, Arozarena roped Soroka's hanging slider, lifting the 3-2 offering high to left field. The lofty drive went 363 feet on a 36-degree launch angle.\n\nUnlike Soroka, Eflin pounded the zone with strikes through four innings, using just 48 pitches and facing only 14 batters, two batters over the minimum.\n\nThe visitors loaded the bases in the fifth after Rays shortstop Jose Caballero booted a two-out grounder by Nicky Lopez. However, Eflin got Gavin Sheets for the final out, a shallow flyout to right on a 3-0 sinker.\n\nParedes hammered a 404-foot solo shot to left center in the sixth, but DeJong broke the ice for the White Sox with a solo drive, his fourth, to make it 5-1 in the seventh.\n\nRelievers Phil Maton and Manuel Rodriguez tossed scoreless innings as the Rays neatly put away the White Sox and secured the series win.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@star-telegram.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_DeJong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul DeJong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ram\u00edrez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harold Ram\u00edrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Rortvedt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Rortvedt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicky Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Sheets", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Sheets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Maton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Maton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/cidk5k/picture288407310/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/b17e8e66-bf93-4a52-a904-6f4fa8e1b2c7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

PETERSBURG -- The Rays were waiting Tuesday afternoon for test results on Ryan Pepiot's left leg before deciding how to set up their rotation for the weekend series against the Yankees and beyond.\n\nPepiot was forced from Sunday's game when he was hit on the leg by a 107.5-mph line drive. Though initial X-rays were negative, he came in sore Monday and more so on Tuesday. That led team officials to send him for a CT scan, which can provide a more detailed image of any fracture.\n\nThe Rays seem likely to insert Taj Bradley, who just completed rehab from a spring pectoral muscle strain, into the rotation Friday for his season debut. Pepiot's status impacts what else they do, as his turn comes up Saturday. If he ends up on the injured list or needing extra time, they could start Zack Littell on Saturday and lefty Tyler Alexander on Sunday.\n\n\"Pepiot came in a little sorer than what we were anticipating,\" manager Kevin Cash said before Tuesday's game. \"So he's in the doctor's office right now, getting a CT scan. And that all kind of has an affect on -- between Taj, between Ryan, all of those things -- so we don't have quite the rotation moving forward, or won't announce that, until we get a little more clarity.\"\n\nThe offense topped by Jonny DeLuca got most of the attention in Monday's 8-2 win over the White Sox, but the Rays also did a pretty good job on the mound.\n\nAlexander worked into the fifth inning, striking out seven and allowing only two runs. With a 4-2 lead, Alexander allowed the first two batters to reach in the fifth. With most of the frontline relievers getting the night off after a busy weekend, the Rays turned next to Erasmo Ramirez.\n\nThe veteran right-hander had been used mostly in lower-leverage situations, but he was up to the challenge Monday, getting the Nos. 2-3-4 hitters -- Tommy Pham, Andrew Vaughn, Eloy Jimenez -- out in order. Then he got the Rays through the sixth and seventh without allowing a hit.\n\n\"Erasmo did a tremendous job,\" Cash said. \"Having to come right through the 2-3-4 of their lineup and get three fly balls on (five) pitches was pretty huge, and it allowed him to go a little deeper than maybe we had originally thought.\"\n\nThe Rays then summoned Edwin Uceta, the 26-year-old called up earlier Monday, to close out the final two innings with an 8-2 lead, and he delivered what Cash called an \"awesome\" performance, allowing just one walk. Uceta, who had previous big-league time with the Dodgers, Diamondbacks and Mets (a total of 25 games and 40 1/3 innings), signed a minor-league contract with the Rays during the offseason and impressed during spring camp.\n\n\"We were really happy about him in spring and (he) threw strikes,\" Cash said. \"In that situation, you want to throw a lot of strikes.\"\n\nSecond baseman Brandon Lowe (oblique strain) started his rehab assignment with Triple-A Durham on Tuesday, going 1-for-2 with a walk and playing five innings in the field. Reliever Pete Fairbanks (nerve-related issue) also made his first rehab appearance, allowing two hits in an inning and showing good velocity. Cash said team officials and Fairbanks would discuss whether he will make another rehab outing. ... Centerfielder Jose Siri, who is 3-for-his-last-37, was out of the lineup for a second straight game, but is expected to start Wednesday. ... Right-hander Jacob Waguespack was recalled from Durham and placed on the 15-day injured list due to a shoulder issue. He is not expected to be out long, but doing it this way the Rays, if he were to have a setback, can move him to the 60-day IL and thus replace him on the 40-man roster. ... Tampa-born Hall of Famer Tony La Russa, back with the White Sox as a senior adviser and feeling good after dealing with heart and cancer issues, made the trip to Tropicana Field. He visited Monday with Cash and planned to check in during the week with Lou Piniella, another Tampa native and longtime MLB manager.\n\n* * *\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

As a low-budget franchise, they're always willing to be a year early in trading away their biggest names rather than risking losing them for nothing. But we've also seen, particularly in the 2020s, that the Rays are willing to make a marquee addition midseason if they think it will increase their odds at a championship.\n\nAt 19-19 approaching the quarter turn of the 2024 season, the Rays are going to be one of the most interesting teams to watch at the trade deadline. Their buy/sell decisions could come down to whether they play good or bad baseball in the final two weeks leading up to the deadline. Or, they could do the exact opposite of what we all think if they get a good deal.\n\nNo matter what, Tampa Bay will be one of the teams with the greatest impact on the rest of the league based on who they chase versus who they make available.\n\nSo let's make a trio of realistic trades the Rays could pull off between now and the deadline that represent the full spectrum of paths Tampa Bay might take if the market swings any particular direction. The only real directive is that we can't realistically expect the Rays to take on significant long-term payroll, but everything else is on the table.\n\nIt's time to step into the button-down of president Erik Neander and start wheeling and dealing.\n\nTrade 2B Brandon Lowe\n\nThe Rays are the masters of cutting bait with players who have been extremely productive for them in the past, but won't be big parts of their future. Look at their trade of Chris Archer that netted them Austin Meadows and Tyler Glasnow, or the subsequent trade of Meadows that brought them Isaac Paredes. Now it's longtime second baseman Brandon Lowe's turn to help secure the next version of the Rays' low-cost, high-output baseball machine.\n\nLowe has a 125 OPS+ in his seven-year Rays career, punctuated by a 39-homer season in 2021. He is on his second contract and has eight-figure club options for 2025 and 2026. But the Rays won't want to pay that, because Lowe has spent most of this season on the injured list and the Rays have found a tandem at second base that replaces his production for a quarter of the price. Richie Palacios and Amed Rosario have been two of the most consistent hitters on the team, rendering Lowe expendable.\n\nThere are a number of teams that could make sense as trade partners for Lowe, so it likely comes down to who among playoff contenders is desperate enough to overpay Tampa Bay at the deadline. The St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds are all in the same division and have had no production from their second base options.\n\nAnd the New York Yankees, one of the Rays' top adversaries, stand to let a struggling Gleyber Torres walk after this season. They could be happy to pay Lowe's club options ($10.5 million, then $11.5 million) rather than look elsewhere for their next second baseman.\n\nAcquire Marlins LHP Jes\u00fas Luzardo\n\nAs much as the Rays are willing to part with anyone at any time, they will also take their occasional swing at a marquee trade target if they feel it comes at a position of need. They did it with DH Nelson Cruz in 2021, although that backfired due to Cruz's poor performance, and then again in 2023 with starting pitcher Aaron Civale.\n\nThis season, it appears the Rays need help in the rotation once again, with Shane McClanahan, Jeffrey Springs and Shane Baz still recovering from Tommy John surgery. So, they swoop in and snag one of the most coveted arms at the deadline, the Miami Marlins' Jes\u00fas Luzardo.\n\nIn October, it would have seemed unfathomable the Marlins would trade Luzardo. He had just turned 26 and was coming off a season where he struck out 208 batters, 12th in MLB, to help guide Miami to the postseason.\n\nBut he has a 6.58 ERA in five starts this season, is currently on a rehab assignment after dealing with an elbow strain and is on a Marlins team that has gone into full-on tank/rebuild mode. So suddenly, he seem like one of the more sensible options for the Marlins to deal in exchange for a sizable haul of future talent.\n\nLuzardo has exactly the same amount of team control remaining as Civale did when the Rays acquired him last season-he becomes a free agent after 2026. He's making $5.5 million this season, less than Lowe, who we just hypothetically erased from the Rays' books, and stands to make about the same next year based on his shoddy start to 2024.\n\nBut the Rays know Luzardo is capable of dominance and they have one of the more notorious pitching factories in the league that should ensure Luzardo performs at his best. If they part with a pair of top-ten organizational prospects, they can get their man in Luzardo.\n\nTrade RP Shawn Armstrong for Kansas City Royals RP James McArthur\n\nThis is a move that's so Tampa Bay Rays it hurts. Shawn Armstrong is a 33-year-old journeyman reliever who has seen his most success by far as a member of the Rays. He's had two stints in Tampa with a 2.82 ERA over 106 appearances, and a 5.19 ERA in his 149 appearances elsewhere.\n\nThe 2023 season was his Mona Lisa, posting a 1.38 ERA in 52 innings with 54 strikeouts. But Armstrong is also a free agent at the end of this season and at his advanced age, it's questionable whether the Rays would even want to bring him back, let alone outbid other potential suitors in free agency.\n\nSo what to do instead? Trade one of their most proven bullpen pieces for an unproven piece from another organization, only to apply a little magic Rays pixie dust and turn the new guy into a lethal weapon. The Kansas City Royals' James McArthur is 27, has just 33 career appearances and a 4.43 ERA. But when the Rays look at someone like him, all they see is potential.\n\nMcArthur is 6-foot-7, has top 10% whiff and walk rates and throws a knee-buckling curveball that has a high whiff rate, but also gets hit harder than you would think. The Rays could take his pitch mix in a number of exciting directions, whether it's switching from the sinker to the four-seam to tunnel off the curveball or turning the slider into more of a sweeper. This is a way for Tampa Bay to sell an expiring asset to a team desperate to contend and grab a controllable piece that will remain a fixture of their bullpen for the next half-decade.", "source":

PETERSBURG -- If it happened once or twice, you might think it was just a coincidence, or a couple of bad pitches.\n\nBut Wednesday was the fourth straight start in which Aaron Civale got himself into trouble and knocked out of the game in the fifth inning.\n\nThey went on to lose to the White Sox 4-1, snapping a season-high five-game winning streak, ending the undefeated debut of their City Connect uniforms, and dropping back to .500 at 19-19.\n\n\"I don't have a real good answer,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said.\n\nCivale didn't get much help as the Rays offense, which scored 33 runs in the previous five games, was held to one, and just four hits by Sox starter Chris Flexen and three relievers. Twice they had a chance for more runs, but had a runner doubled off.\n\nBut Civale's ongoing struggles seemed the bigger issue.\n\nAcquired at last year's trade deadline after going 5-2 with a 2.34 ERA for Cleveland, he went just 2-3, 5.36 for the Rays. Team officials insisted this spring he wasn't as bad as his numbers showed, and his 2-1 record with a 2.74 ERA through his first four starts this season (working six innings three times and five once) provided some validation.\n\nBut his 0-2 record with a 9.82 ERA -- and his inability to finish the fifth -- in his last four starts may re-frame the question.\n\nIn the fifth inning of his three previous outings, Civale gave up four, three and four runs. Wednesday, it was two, on a 101.5-mph leadoff double by Bryan Ramos and a 104.2-mph 400-foot Paul DeJong home run off a cutter. He got two outs, then gave up a 100.8-mph single to ex-Ray Tommy Pham, and a walk. Though he'd thrown 82 pitches, Cash pulled him before the 2-1 Sox lead could grow.\n\nCash said that with Civale maintaining velocity and the quality of his stuff it's not a physical issue, nor one of pitch sequencing, suggesting the repeated troubles may be just coincidence or luck he described with a word worse than bad.\n\n\"He gave up a double, and then DeJong came up and hit the home run pretty quick,\" Cash said. \"You're talking about giving two runs up. We're going to take that.\n\n\"I'd like to see him get through the inning. But that was kind of more my decision. He had pitches left. [I] just wanted to try to do everything we could to keep the game right where it was. And they just tacked on runs [two, off reliever Kevin Kelly, the next inning].\"\n\nCivale, who cruised through the first three innings and got out of a two-on jam in the fourth, said his command and execution on some of his breaking pitches in the fifth was the issue, and nothing more.\n\nActually, he said he considered Wednesday a sign of progress.\n\n\"Obviously, I want to pitch through the fifth and further into the game. But at the end of the day, [I've] just got to go out there and make more pitches,\" he said.\n\n\"My goal is to throw as many innings as possible for both myself and for the bullpen, and that's what a starter is supposed to do. So yeah, obviously, that side of things is frustrating. I want to pitch deeper into games, but [Wednesday] was definitely a step in the right direction, relative to recency.\"\n\nCash made it sound like they were not overly concerned.\n\n\"We're not going to dwell on him not being able, or him having a couple outings here where the fifth inning has been an issue,\" he said.\n\n\"If the stuff is staying consistent where it is in the first and second inning, we're going to be pleased about that. It can creep up on you any time. I think it's probably more coincidence than anything. I totally respect the question, though. I mean, it has happened three, four times now. But we're not going to, I can't take him out of the game in the fourth, especially after he's thrown 60 pitches.\"\n\nThe Rays got their first hit and lone run in the fourth, but a chance for more disappeared as Harold Ramirez broke from third on a contact play and Amed Rosario's line drive was turned into a double play.\n\nThey had a slight rally in the seventh with two walks around an out and Josh Lowe pinch-hitting, but his fly ball toward the rightfield line was run down by Gavin Sheets, and Isaac Paredes -- who made a bad read and broke for third -- was doubled off.\n\n\"I was confused there; that's something that just can't happen,\" Paredes said, via team interpreter Manny Navarro. \"I thought it was going to fall.\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marc_topkin@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Marc Topkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Civale", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Civale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Pham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Pham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_DeJong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul DeJong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Sheets", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Sheets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ram\u00edrez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harold Ram\u00edrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amed_Rosario", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amed Rosario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RAYSSOX-jpg.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

But as pinch-hitter Josh Lowe flied to right for the second out, Paredes broke from second and was standing on third when the Sox doubled him off second.\n\nAnd not much else.\n\nCivale worked quickly through the first three innings, and got out of a two-on jam in the fourth.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Civale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Civale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ram\u00edrez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harold Ram\u00edrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amed_Rosario", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amed Rosario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28853/2885359.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

There are several aces set to take the mound, which could make scoring difficult in a few games. Let's dig into the betting market and highlight three props to consider.\n\nAfter scoring six runs against the Marlins on Monday, the Dodgers' lineup could have another productive evening. Starting for the Marlins will be Edward Cabrera, who had a 4.43 FIP and a 1.44 WHIP last season. Through four starts this year, he has a 1.50 WHIP and has given up 14 runs (13 earned) across 19.1 innings.\n\nOne of the reasons why Cabrera has sported such a high WHIP is that he has command issues. He has already walked 10 batters this season and he has a 13.8 percent walk rate for his career. One of the members of the Dodgers who has the best chance of drawing at least one walk in this game is Mookie Betts. He has at least one walk in seven of his last 11 games and has posted a 16.6 percent walk rate for the season.\n\nAnother player prop to target against Cabrera is total bases for Shohei Ohtani. Ohtani hit yet another home run Monday and is now slugging .705 for the season. At home, he has a .747 slugging percentage. Taking him to record at least two total bases comes with plus odds on DraftKings, which is too good to pass up.\n\nMLB fans: Get in on the action with the BetMGM bonus code for a first-bet bonus welcome offer worth up to $1,500 when using code ROTOBONUS. BetMGM is one of several leading sportsbooks that accept credit card and PayPal.\n\nThe Rays received a boost to their lineup with Josh Lowe returning from the injured list Monday. He promptly went 2-for-5 with a double as the Rays scored eight runs against the White Sox, all of which came within the first six innings.\n\nStarting for the White Sox on Tuesday will be Michael Soroka, who has a 6.48 ERA and a 6.71 FIP over seven starts. He has given up at least four runs while pitching five or fewer innings in four of his outings. Behind him is an overworked bullpen that has a 1.47 WHIP, which is the second-highest mark in baseball. Look for the Rays to score in bunches again.\n\nMLB Picks for Rays vs. White Sox\n\nMLB Best Bets Today Recap", "source": {"uri": "rotowire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RotoWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_barner@rotowire.com", "name": "Mike Barner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cabrera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edward Cabrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_bases", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Total bases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_independent_pitching_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defense independent pitching statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/bb4ovozni7ehu4fzjrx2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

When can we expect the hits?", "body": "ST. PETERSBURG -- The Rays have reached an anniversary, of sorts. Or a grim reminder, if you prefer.\n\nWith their victory against the White Sox on Monday night, the Rays evened their record at 18-18. Maybe nothing to celebrate, but something of an accomplishment considering they had been outscored by 32 runs and lead the league in surgical scars.\n\nAnd, in case you needed reminding, the Rays were 29-7 at this exact point last season. This was shortly after Jeffrey Springs blew out his elbow, and a week before Drew Rasmussen would do the same. Since then, the Rays also lost Shane Baz and Shane McClanahan and have gone 88-74.\n\nBecause Tampa Bay is starting to become whole again. Josh Lowe was activated off the injured list on Monday, Brandon Lowe was scheduled to begin a minor-league rehab in Durham on Tuesday, Springs is pitching in an extended spring game later this month, and Rasmussen is ready to start throwing off a mound.\n\nIt's fantasy to think the Rays can replicate the historic pace they were on when healthy last season, but maybe it's not so outlandish to think there are better days to come this summer.\n\n\"Going back to last April ... there wasn't a whole lot of excitement about what that team was capable of doing, and they changed that very quickly,\" president of baseball operations Erik Neander said. \"There was no expectation that that group was going to run roughshod through the league, but they synced up very well before, unfortunately, the injuries hit.\n\n\"So when we look at this group, getting our position players back, should put us in a place where our lineup is extremely balanced and our bench is deep. We're going to score more runs and the pressure will not be on any one individual. We'll get some guys back from a pitching standpoint and I think our expectations for this group will be comparable to where our expectations have been for the last five seasons.\"\n\nBecause they are not built around two or three superstars, there's a misperception that the Rays can withstand injuries with their depth. The problem is that their depth is actually a daily part of their success. They aspire to mix and match as much as any team in the league to get the upper hand.\n\nBut, with left-handed hitters Josh Lowe, Brandon Lowe and Jonathan Aranda on the injured list, the Rays have been forced to use players in roles they're not accustomed to. Harold Ramirez, for instance, played in every one of the first 32 games. In the two previous seasons, he played in 79% of Tampa Bay's games when on the active roster. That goes a long way in explaining why his OPS has dropped from .813 to .637. He's facing pitchers he would not normally see.\n\nHere's another way of looking at it:\n\nThe Rays have had the platoon advantage in 43.3% of their plate appearances in 2024. That ranks 28th in the majors. A year ago, they had the platoon advantage 52.9% of the time. The year before that, they were at 57.9%.\n\nThat's why Josh Lowe's return this week is such a big deal. It not only adds a talented bat, but it balances the lineup. And that balance will only grow when Brandon Lowe and Aranda return.\n\n\"We've always been able to counter moves to create an advantage when a team is going to a lefty or righty specialist,\" Neander said. \"In April, we just weren't able to do that.\"\n\nThe bullpen has been in a similar situation. Because Colin Poche is on the injured list and Tyler Alexander had to fill in for Taj Bradley in the rotation, there was only one left-hander among the eight relievers on the roster Monday night against the White Sox.\n\nSo what might this team look like in another three months?\n\nBarring unforeseen circumstances, the rotation will include Springs and Bradley. Rasmussen should be available in a hybrid role as a multi-inning reliever or bulk pitcher. Baz will also be in the mix, although he's more of a wild card since he has thrown barely 40 innings in the past two years and has only 31 starts above Class A in his career.\n\nIt's not exactly the same crew that had a 6.5-game lead in the AL East at this point last season, but it's a lot closer than the roster Tampa Bay has been using the past six weeks.\n\n\"Our more accomplished pitchers, our more touch, feel, command, artistic pitchers will be there,\" Neander said. \"And then some of our younger, power guys like Taj, (Ryan) Pepiot, Baz will be available, however all of that sorts out. So it should be a kind of fun mix in that way.\"\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Chris Flexen stayed on a roll with six innings of one-run ball, and shortstop Paul DeJong - one of five White Sox to collect two hits - led the way with a go-ahead home run and two runs scored in a 4-1 victory against the Rays Wednesday night.\n\nTommy Pham, Andrew Vaughn, Bryan Ramos and Andrew Benintendi each had two hits as the Sox tied a season high with 12 hits to salvage the third game of series against the Rays and complete a 3-3 road trip that began in St. Louis.\n\nThe Sox (9-28) are 4-2 against the Rays (19-19).\n\nJohn Brebbia recorded five outs, three on strikeouts, and Michael Kopech pitched a scoreless ninth for his third save.\n\nFlexen owns a 1.61 ERA over his last five outings (three starts). He struck out a season high eight batters, walked one and allowed three hits.\n\nRamos doubled and scored on DeJong's homer against Aaron Civale, and, hitting to the right side to advance Andrew Benintendi, scored him instead with a single. He showed good instincts advancing to third but also almost crashed into catcher Martin Maldonado on a foul pop.\n\nAll told, he has made a good impression in his first five major league games.\n\n\"He doesn't look overmatched,\" general manager Chris Getz said. \"This is a nice opportunity to boost his development.\"\n\nRamos, who is 5-for-14 with a walk and two RBI, doubled off the left field wall.\n\n\"I said 'Go ball,' '' Ramos said. \"Two more push-ups and it's a home run.\"\n\nRight fielder Gavin Sheets doubled and walked twice and made long running catch of Jose Caballero's pop-up near the foul line and easily doubled Isaac Paredes, who didn't think Sheets would get to the ball, off second to end the seventh.\n\n\"I got a good read on it,\" Sheets said. \"I was in the right-center gap, could tell he got it off the end a little bit and just took off.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Chicago White Sox needed length from starter Michael Soroka.\n\nA night after command issues led to an early exit for Mike Clevinger, it looked like Soroka was headed toward a similar fate.\n\nBut the right-hander found a way to fight through five innings in a 5-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays in front of 10,872 on Tuesday at Tropicana Field.\n\nSoroka allowed four runs (three earned) on three hits with four strikeouts and four walks. He threw a season-high 102 pitches, 59 of which were strikes.\n\n\"Fairly similar to what it's been through this year,\" Soroka said of the evening. \"It's time to put one together for a whole outing. I feel like every time I come out, it's 'there's some good, there's some bad, I got bit.' Which was tonight.\n\n\"I got bit in the long counts. Long-count walks, long-count the only hard contact that they had. They saw a lot of pitches. I've got to do a better job of filling it up early and making them put it in play or putting them away.\"\n\nNo at-bat summed up the night better than a third-inning battle with Randy Arozarena.\n\nThe Sox trailed 2-0 when Soroka faced Arozarena with one out and one on. Soroka got Arozarena to swing-and-miss on a fastball and slider to quickly jump ahead in the count 0-2.\n\nSoroka threw a slider in the dirt for ball one. He followed with two fastballs, which Arozarena fouled off.\n\nSoroka threw another slider in the dirt on the fifth pitch for a ball. Arozarena fouled off another fastball and then took a high fastball to run the count full.\n\nThe ninth pitch was a slider over the plate. Arozarena jumped all over it for a two-run home run to left.\n\n\"I felt like I made a lot of good pitches,\" Soroka said. \"Credit to him for fighting a lot of them off.\n\n\"It kind of comes down to executing. If I throw a good one, it's probably at best a weakly-hit baseball. I threw a bad one and he made me pay.\"\n\nSoroka rebounded to retire eight of the final nine hitters he faced, which was a positive for the Sox after Clevinger exited following two-plus innings in Monday's 8-2 loss to the Rays.\n\n\"I'm glad I got the chance to go back out there for two more and put those two together,\" Soroka said. \"Take those and move those into the next outing and forget the rest.\"\n\nThe Sox had a big scoring opportunity in the fifth.\n\nThey entered the inning with just one hit -- a single in the second by Bryan Ramos.\n\nWith two outs in the fifth, Paul DeJong singled to left. Korey Lee followed with another single. And when shortstop Jos\u00e9 Caballero couldn't handle Nicky Lopez's grounder for an error, the Sox had the bases loaded with Gavin Sheets up as the tying run.\n\nSheets got ahead in the count 3-0. He got the green light and hit a sinker off the end of his bat to right field, where Josh Lowe made a catch to end the threat.\n\nSox manager Pedro Grifol credited Rays starter Zach Eflin for executing the right pitch at the right time.\n\n\"He ran a two-seamer right on the corner, it was a perfect pitch and he hit it off the end of the bat,\" Grifol said. \"Sheets has been clutch for us all year long, he was going to be really aggressive there and see if we can hit a ball in the gap or seats. He made a good pitch on a 3-0 count. He made the perfect pitch.\"\n\nEflin allowed one run, a home run to DeJong, on six hits with three strikeouts and no walks in seven innings.\n\nThe Sox went 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position and left eight on base while falling to 8-28 -- their worst 36-game start in franchise history. For the second time this year, they are a season-high 20 games under .500.\n\n\"It's not too much different than what I've been telling you guys the whole year about me -- there's a lot of good, there's some bad and we're just getting bit,\" Soroka said. \"We're putting together better at-bats of late, we're putting together better innings. It's just a matter of keep going.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lamond_pope@chicagotribune.com", "name": "LaMond Pope", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Soroka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Igor Soroka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Clevinger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Clevinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropicana_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropicana Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicky Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Sheets", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Sheets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_DeJong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul DeJong"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CTC-Z-White-Sox-Rays-Baseball_190527378.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The O's and Yankees are separated by one game in the standings, or, really, two-half games, since they have the same number of wins but the Yankees have played two more games.\n\nHere are the AL East standings as of Tuesday morning:\n\nBaltimore Orioles: 23-11New York Yankees: 23-13 (1 GB)Boston Red Sox: 19-16 (4.5 GB)Tampa Bay Rays: 18-18 (6 GB)Toronto Blue Jays: 16-19 (7.5 GB)\n\nThe Orioles sitting atop the AL East is not a surprise. They won 101 games and the division last year, added Corbin Burnes, and their young position players have another year of experience under their belt. If the O's had started slow this season, it would have been a surprise, though not necessarily a reason to panic. Instead, they're doing exactly what they were expected to do.\n\nThe Yankees went 82-80 a year ago, their worst record in three decades. They then added Juan Soto over the winter, and also Marcus Stroman and Alex Verdugo. If anything, we've yet to see the fully operational version of the Yankees because Aaron Judge is just now hitting his stride at the plate, and reigning Cy Young winner Gerrit Cole has yet to pitch because of an elbow injury.\n\nAs for the rest of the AL East, the Red Sox have surprised everyone with their elite run prevention, though it has mostly been tough sledding for the Blue Jays and Rays. The Orioles and Yankees look like the cream of the crop in the AL East (in that order), but the remaining three clubs should not be discounted. Here's why it's still too early to call the AL East a two-team race.\n\n1. The Red Sox are better than expected Wilyer Abreu BOS * RF * #52 BA0.297R16HR2RBI13SB5 View Profile\n\nUnlike the Blue Jays and Rays, Boston's plus-41 run differential is very good and essentially identical to the Yankees' (plus-42), and one or two blowout wins away from Baltimore's (plus-55). The Red Sox have a 2.61 ERA, the best in baseball, and that comes only a year after finishing 21st with a 4.79 ERA. New pitching coach Andrew Bailey has revamped the team's pitching approach.\n\nThat league-leading 2.61 ERA is a bit deceptive because unearned runs count, and the Red Sox lead baseball with 30 unearned runs allowed, seven more (30% more!) than any other team. Their defense, particularly on the infield in the wake of Trevor Story's injury, is weak. That said, the Red Sox are still excellent when you look at total runs allowed per game:\n\nSeattle Mariners: 3.26Kansas City Royals: 3.31New York Yankees: 3.44Boston Red Sox: 3.46Cleveland Guardians: 3.60Baltimore Orioles: 3.68\n\nTherein lies the kicker: Baltimore and the Yankees are elite run-prevention teams as well, and their offenses are more fearsome, particularly with Story and Triston Casas out with long-term injuries. That said, the Red Sox are averaging a healthy 5.00 runs per game since Casas got hurt, so the offense is not a total pushover. Rookie outfielder Wilyer Abreu has been sneaky great.\n\nNick Pivetta is expected to return this week and Brayan Bello and Garrett Whitlock aren't too far away either, so the rotation is close to whole. Bottom line, when you prevent runs as well as the Red Sox, you have a chance to win just about every night. This team has had a knack for out-of-nowhere great seasons. All it takes is one good three- or four-week run to make the Orioles and Yankees sweat.\n\n2. Tampa's top hitters are starting to get on track Yandy Diaz TB * 1B * #2 BA0.234R12HR1RBI16SB0 View Profile\n\nIt's hard to believe it is May 7 and Randy Arozarena and Yandy D\u00edaz are hitting a combined .193/.292/.293 in 301 plate appearances. A year ago, those two slashed .291/.386/.472 together, with D\u00edaz winning the AL batting title. This year, they are among the least productive everyday players in the majors. It's shocking, really.\n\nThere are indications those two are coming out of their early season slumps, however. This past weekend, D\u00edaz had three straight multi-hit games in a sweep of the New York Mets, and Arozarena went deep twice in the series. That including a two-out, two-strike, game-tying blast against Edwin D\u00edaz in the ninth inning Sunday. Arozarena then reached base three times Monday.\n\nIsaac Paredes is humming along with his \"pull everything for a home run\" approach, new additions Richie Palacios and Ben Rortvedt have been pleasant surprises, Josh Lowe just came off the injured list, and Brandon Lowe (oblique) will begin a rehab assignment soon. Get Arozarena and D\u00edaz fully back on track, and the Rays will be cooking offensively.\n\nThe pitching, however, is a much larger issue. Tampa is allowing 5.09 runs per game, fifth most in baseball, and other than Taj Bradley and Shane Baz, who just began a rehab assignment, there's not much help on the horizon. Shane McClanahan will miss the season with Tommy John surgery and Drew Rasmussen and Jeffrey Springs aren't due back from their elbow procedures until the second half.\n\nHistory says the Rays will lose more pitchers to injury -- the Rays are excellent at a great many things, but keeping pitchers healthy is not one of them -- and history also says the Rays will figure it out. At this time last year the bullpen was a major concern and you would have gotten laughed at for suggesting Zack Littell could be a No. 3 type starter. Then the Rays did what the Rays do.\n\nTampa has earned the benefit of the doubt and shouldn't be written off not even a month and a half into the season. Arozarena and D\u00edaz are showing signs of life and the front office has shown that, given time, they'll cobble together a top pitching staff. They have their work cut out for them, no doubt, but the first step (Arozarena and D\u00edaz starting to hit) appears to be underway.\n\n3. It's May 7, stupid\n\nYes, I am aware of that. Roughly 20% of the regular season has been played and that leaves, oh, another 130-something games on the schedule. Last May 7, the Red Sox, Minnesota Twins, Pittsburgh Pirates, and San Diego Padres were all in postseason position. Things didn't go well for them the rest of the way. The Houston Astros were .500 and it appeared their AL West rein was ending.\n\nI will say that, unlike the Rays and Red Sox, the Blue Jays look to be in real trouble. They're among the 10 worst teams in runs scored per game and runs allowed per game, they're mostly healthy, and they don't have much help waiting in Triple-A. If there is one AL East team that should be worried (like really, really worried), it's Toronto.\n\nThat all said, it is only May 7, and these AL East teams have shown themselves to be too good and too resourceful to write them off with so much season still to play. The Orioles and Yankees have started the season very well, the others not so much, but there is plenty of time remaining to change the narrative and change the standings.", "source": {"uri":

White was previously in Triple-A, where he continued a two-year trend of struggling to throw strikes. Perhaps a new organization in a less pressurized environment will get him back on track.\n\nWhite was considered a closer-in-the-making before command issues arose following April 2022 Tommy John surgery. In 7 2/3 innings this season, he allowed 10 hits, 10 walks and 15 earned runs (17.61 ERA) and struck out 10.\n\nIn 2023, Baseball America (20) and MLB Pipeline (27) included White among the Rays' top prospects, touting his \"electric\" fastball that touches 98.\n\nBut his development has been stunted since the surgery. While command was never a strong suit, White's wildness has held him back from a major-league promotion. He walked 17 in 22 total innings across three minor-league levels last season and added three more walks in 3 2/3 spring training frames.\n\nThe Yankees don't have to dream about the potential with White because he showed it in 2021. That's when he rocketed through four levels of the Rays minor leagues, striking out 104 in 62 1/3 innings. He walked only 15 batters and had a 1.44 ERA.\n\nNow, the Yankees have to rebuild White and his confidence. If he unlocks his command, it would not be surprising to see him reach the majors this year. The caveat is \"if,\" of course. MLB Pipeline's 2023 scouting report hinted at what was thought to be a near-MLB-ready arm:\n\nEarly in the rehab process, White noted that his arm hadn't felt so good in years. It's too soon to say how fully his stuff will return or how long that might take, but the Rays are optimistic he'll regain his form and impact their bullpen sooner than later.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/UWFNBB2C3FHRHKBP4HAI6LPVHI.jpg?auth=bc2fb1e7b5311798d0b477038bc901a360e1394c179ed6f614e918ba6892485a&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544612", "eventUri": "eng-9544612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

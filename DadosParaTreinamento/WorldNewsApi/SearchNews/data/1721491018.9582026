{"id": 237074462, "title": "Let's hope feds can quickly untangle Dolton's web of alleged shady dealings", "text": "It\u2019s getting to the point where folks in Dolton are going to need a Venn diagram to keep track of the tangle of relationships and alleged corruption connected to the village\u2019s self-declared \u201csupermayor\u201d Tiffany Henyard. The latest: Henyard was the driving force behind some $200,000 in no-bid, no-contract residential construction work given to a suburban construction firm that\u2019s been linked to property tax avoidance schemes and bribery, according to a report by Casey Toner of the Illinois Answers Project, also published in Sunday\u2019s Sun-Times. The firm, O.A.K.K. Construction Co., is owned by Alex Nitchoff, who is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in federal court to bribing a Cook County assessor\u2019s office employee to get property tax breaks. The Nitchoff family previously owned a restaurant in Dolton, and the family businesses have given Henyard\u2019s political campaign thousands of dollars, the Sun-Times has reported. A contribution of $5,000 to Henyard in 2022 came just days after O.A.K.K. billed Dolton for $205,000 in no-bid, no-contract construction work at dozens of homes. O.A.K.K. then sent letters to homeowners threatening them with liens against their property when the village board, which hadn\u2019t authorized O.A.K.K. to do the work, balked at paying the bills. The homeowners apparently knew nothing about the arrangement, prompting one homeowner to write in an email to village officials, \u201cI am really confused right now. \u2026 This is asinine.\u201d Yes, it is. And unfortunately, it\u2019s the kind of fiscal chicanery that seems par for the course for Henyard\u2019s administration. The mayor, who is also Thornton Township supervisor, and some of her associates are among the dozens of businesses, government workers and political leaders named in federal subpoenas issued last month when the FBI raided Dolton\u2019s village hall seeking city records. Former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is also looking into Henyard\u2019s spending of village money, at the behest of board trustees who hired Lightfoot back in April. There\u2019s a Gordian knot of alleged shady dealings to look into here: Henyard using township funds to start a cancer foundation that\u2019s now under investigation by the Illinois attorney general; the village administrator, indicted for allegedly hiding income and assets in a beankruptcy filing, who was getting paid as Henyard\u2019s township adviser and by other villages besides Dolton; Henyard\u2019s \u201cboyfriend\u201d who is paid \u201cin excess of $100,000\" by the township, according to divorce records. That\u2019s not all, but the point about Venn diagrams or flow charts is clear. Federal investigations can take months, if not years. We hope that\u2019s not the case with Dolton. An investigation of all the allegations against Henyard and others has to be thorough, fair, and as swift as possible.

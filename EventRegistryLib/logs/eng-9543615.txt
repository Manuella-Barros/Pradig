But the Maryland-based company quickly fell behind as it hit manufacturing challenges and clinical trial delays.\n\nWhile its protein-based shot eventually won regulatory clearance, the OK came more than a year and a half after rival vaccines. Sales have been slow since, even despite a pitch that it's easier to distribute and has a competitive safety profile.\n\nShares have lost nearly all their value from pandemic highs, inviting outside pressure over the company's direction.\n\nShah Capital, which owns 7.5% of Novavax's common stock, published a letter last month calling for a leadership \"shakeup\" at the company. The investor pointed to what it described as \"colossal market failures, a non-existent partnership strategy, no clear understanding of technology, questionable regulatory management and ongoing operating losses and inefficiencies.\"\n\nShah has pitched two candidates for the company's board and, on Monday, urged shareholders to vote against Novavax's slate of director nominees at an upcoming annual meeting on June 13.\n\nIt's not the first time the investor has criticized the company's performance. \"We wrote our first letter in 2023 because they were spending money like drunken sailors,\" Himanshu Shah, Shah's founder, president and chief investment officer, said in an interview. \"So we asked them to be more efficient with how they're spending their money.\"\n\nAlthough COVID infection patterns are now closer to those for the flu, Novavax hasn't capitalized on the push for yearly boosters, Shah said. In particular, he noted how Novavax hasn't gotten traction at retail pharmacies, where more than 95% of Americans received seasonal shots last year.\n\n\"The company has really mucked up the marketing,\" Shah said. \"People don't even know they exist.\"\n\nNovavax has pitched its vaccine, called Nuvaxovid, as an alternative for people hesitant about the messenger RNA technology used in Pfizer's and Moderna's COVID shots. The company has also highlighted how Nuvaxovid is easier to distribute in hard-to-reach places of the world.\n\nThose advantages haven't yielded market gains, however. Early last year, Novavax CEO John Jacobs described the \"uncertainty\" surrounding the company's future on an earnings call, triggering concerns it could face bankruptcy. To stay afloat, the company laid off 30% of its workforce and cut $500 million from R&D and other operating expenses. It recently reached a settlement with the vaccine group Gavi to clear what one analyst called a \"black cloud\" over the company's balance sheet.\n\nOnce again, Novavax is betting its future on the potential of its \"Matrix-M\" vaccine platform, which uses an adjuvant derived from Chilean soapbark trees, as it studies a combination COVID and flu vaccine that it hopes could arrive on the market in 2026.\n\n\"They've done a phenomenal job getting through the woods,\" Mayank Mamtani, managing director and group head of healthcare at B. Riley Securities, said. \"They are doing everything you'd expect a company to do when the market comes for you, like COVID did, and then dissipates quickly.\"\n\nAlthough Shah's recent letter \"add[ed] to the pressure\" Novavax is already under, Mamtani said it didn't raise new complaints. Still, he called Shah's concerns \"reasonable\" and noted it's a reminder Novavax needs to move \"faster\" to reassure investors and employees.\n\n\"Novavax is going back to its roots -- focusing on its platform and developing a COVID/flu combo, which I think will be interesting and hopefully on time,\" Mamtani said.\n\nThe company's only other candidate, a malaria vaccine developed by University of Oxford and Serum Institute of India using Novavax's Matrix-M platform, posted positive Phase 3 results earlier this year and has been recommended by the World Health Organization.\n\nOtherwise, the company has no other publicly disclosed R&D programs, which Shah has criticized. He argues Novavax should expand its research into other infectious diseases.\n\nBut Mamtani cautioned that vaccine development is a \"multi-year effort\" and that even if Novavax pursues an ideal target like RSV, it could face challenges.\n\n\"RSV is logical, but it's also a competitive space now. So they have to pick their battles with trials and clinical development,\" Mamtani said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Novavax said the company is confident that advancing protein-based vaccines with its platform will be the right move to \"drive long-term sustainable growth.\"\n\nWhile Shah said he's optimistic about the promise of Novavax's platform and estimated it's \"worth serious money,\" he also believes the technology would be \"in better hands\" with a more established vaccine player.\n\n\"The science is great. It works,\" Shah said. \"[But] maybe someone like Sanofi or Pfizer should just buy this company.\"\n\nWith interest in COVID-related vaccine development dwindling, Mamtani said Novavax likely won't be that attractive of takeover target. Instead, a new partnership might be more likely.\n\n\"Novavax is here to stay, but it's going to be a painful journey to raise capital again and again,\" he said. \"It would be nice to have a partner to take some of the costs.\"\n\nIn its last earnings call, Novavax forecast revenue would be flat this year, compared to 2023. The company also plans to switch from offering its COVID vaccine in a five-dose vial to a prefilled syringe.\n\nMamtani maintains that, despite its many struggles, Novavax still has an opportunity. \"There is a business here that should be profitable,\" he said. \"Long term, this is absolutely an important company with the platform they have and the products they're developing. You need more than mRNA.\"", "source": {"uri": "biopharmadive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BioPharma Dive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novavax", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novavax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novavax_COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novavax COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix-M", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matrix-M"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer\u2013BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moderna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GAVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adjuvant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster dose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Messenger RNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pfizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_Institute_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serum Institute of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanofi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.biopharmadive.com/imgproxy/dZYoQTrruo5VJzecR6kG-nZBkZsaYiV7WEjtpf8WW8o/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTEyMzg4MzQ5NzBfMS5qcGc.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543615", "eventUri": "eng-9543615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 1278, "textEnd": 1285}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

(together with its affiliates, \"Shah Capital,\" \"we\" or \"our\") collectively beneficially owns approximately 7.5% of the outstanding common stock of Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX) (\"Novavax\" or the \"Company\"), making it a top three and largest non-index stockholder, today issued the below statement to stockholders regarding its intended efforts at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders scheduled for Thursday, June 13, 2024, 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (the \"Annual Meeting\"):\n\nFellow Novavax Stockholders:\n\nNovavax's upcoming Annual Meeting presents an opportunity to send a strong and clear message to the Company's board of directors (the \"Board\") and management - that stockholders cannot afford the status quo and the time for meaningful Board refreshment is now!\n\nShah Capital recognizes the critical importance of effective board oversight and stewardship. Unfortunately, we have lost faith that the current directors have the ability or willingness to adapt to market pressures and take the steps we believe are necessary to address its continuing dismal performance. As a result, Shah Capital today filed a preliminary proxy statement to solicit stockholders to vote AGAINST the re-election of Richard H. Douglas, Margaret G. McGlynn, and David Mott, each of the Company's Class II Directors up for election at the Annual Meeting. In our view, the Company's current management has failed to implement effective strategies to turn the business around despite its rapidly shrinking share price, necessitating material and immediate board refreshment. Novavax remains today one of the most shorted stocks on NASDAQ.\n\nThe decision to launch this campaign follows our repeated attempts to constructively engage with the Board. We strongly believe in the value of Novavax's deep IP portfolio and Matrix-M adjuvant platform and that there is a vast and currently untapped market for non-mRNA protein vaccines. We have offered several suggestions to the Board aimed at addressing Novavax's apparently self-inflicted problems, which we believe have significantly undermined its growth and success. The Board regrettably has been unresponsive to our suggestions. Shah Capital has, therefore, decided to make its concerns public and has today announced its intention to vote AGAINST the re-election of Mr. Douglas, Ms. McGlynn and Mr. Mott at the Annual Meeting and urges Novavax stockholders to do the same.\n\nShah Capital further believes that the maintenance and expansion of the Company's generous compensation programs for its executive management and directors, given the Company's continuing poor performance and recent massive stockholder dilution is inappropriate. Therefore, Shah Capital is also calling on all Novavax stockholders, as they assess the Company's future direction and leadership, to vote AGAINST three of the Company's other proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting, which include an advisory vote to approve the compensation of Novavax's named executive officers and amendments to certain of it's compensation plans.\n\nWe believe that fresh perspectives are desperately needed in the boardroom to steer Novavax towards sustainable profitable growth. Our campaign provides stockholders with an opportunity to send a clear message to the Company that material change is needed now for the benefit of all stockholders. As a committed long-term investor in Novavax, we have closely monitored the Company's performance and governance practices and are Deeply Concerned by the Company's Shocking Destruction of Stockholder Value and the Market's Apparent Lack of Faith in the Direction of the Company.\n\nWe reiterate our position that Novavax must urgently adopt a more innovative and dynamic sales and marketing strategy. Specifically, that the Company should target key Covid segments in its marketing, such as direct-to-patient outreach for individuals aged 60+ and residents of southern states, as well as develop more effective regulatory stakeholder management, particularly with the FDA. Furthermore, we contend that Novavax should turn its Matrix-M adjuvant franchise's inactive pipeline candidates (such as Flu, RSV, and H5N1) into active opportunities through an infusion of outside capital and potential strategic partnerships. Lastly, we believe efficient and effective spending is necessary for operational profitability at Novavax in 2024 and beyond.\n\nWe urge you to stand with us and vote AGAINST the re-election of Mr. Douglas, Ms. McGlynn and Mr. Mott and AGAINST certain of the Company's other proposals at the Annual Meeting. By voting AGAINST each of the directors eligible for re-election, you will send a strong message to the Board that you are dissatisfied with the status quo and believe urgent change is needed.\n\nUnder the Company's policies, each of the directors up for election at the Annual Meeting have already tendered an irrevocable contingent resignation to the Company's secretary. Such resignations will become effective, only if (i) such director fails to receive the requisite majority vote in an uncontested election and (ii) accepted by the Board. In our view, if our campaign results in any director failing to receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her election, then we believe it would clearly be inappropriate for any such director to continue to serve on the Board and we would call on the Board to promptly accept his or her resignation.\n\nWe urge you to make your voice heard with your \"AGAINST VOTE.\" Your action can help initiate the changes at Novavax that we believe are required to put Novavax on a path towards success and sustained profitable growth.\n\nShah Capital is a global investment firm employing a focused investment philosophy with an emphasis on turnarounds and special situations.\n\nCERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PARTICIPANTS\n\nShah Capital Management, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (\"Shah Capital Management\"), together with the other participants in its solicitation (collectively, \"Shah Capital\"), have filed a preliminary proxy statement and accompanying GOLD proxy card with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") to be used to solicit votes AGAINST the election of Richard H. Douglas, Margaret G. McGlynn and David Mott to the Board of Directors of Novavax, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\") at the Company's 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the \"Annual Meeting\") and AGAINST the approval of certain of the Company's other proposals to be considered by stockholders at the Annual Meeting.\n\nSHAH CAPITAL STRONGLY ADVISES ALL STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER PROXY MATERIALS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION. SUCH PROXY MATERIALS WILL BE AVAILABLE AT NO CHARGE ON THE SEC'S WEBSITE AT HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV.

(NASDAQ:NVAX), has publicly expressed its dissatisfaction with the current board of directors and management, advocating for a significant overhaul.\n\nThe investment firm, which owns approximately 7.5% of Novavax's outstanding common stock, has filed a preliminary proxy statement urging stockholders to vote against the re-election of all Class II directors and against three additional company proposals at the upcoming Annual Meeting on June 13, 2024.\n\nShah Capital has criticized Novavax's management for what it perceives as a failure to adapt to market pressures and to implement strategies that could reverse the company's declining performance. The firm has pointed out Novavax's position as one of the most shorted stocks on NASDAQ as an indicator of the market's lack of confidence in the company's direction.\n\nThe investment firm is particularly concerned with what it sees as the board's unresponsiveness to suggestions that could address Novavax's issues, which Shah Capital believes have significantly undermined the company's growth and success.\n\nThese suggestions include targeting key Covid segments in marketing, developing more effective regulatory stakeholder management, particularly with the FDA, capitalizing on the company's Matrix-M adjuvant platform, and ensuring efficient spending for operational profitability.\n\nShah Capital's campaign for change also extends to the company's compensation programs for executive management and directors, which it deems inappropriate in light of Novavax's poor performance and recent stockholder dilution. The firm is calling on stockholders to vote against the advisory vote to approve executive compensation and amendments to compensation plans.\n\nThe firm's statement emphasizes the need for fresh perspectives in the boardroom to steer Novavax towards sustainable profitable growth. Shah Capital has made its intentions clear, urging stockholders to vote against the re-election of Richard H. Douglas, Margaret G. McGlynn, and David Mott, and against certain other company proposals at the Annual Meeting.\n\nThe information for this article is based on a press release statement from Shah Capital.\n\nAs Novavax Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX) faces scrutiny from major shareholder Shah Capital Management, the company's financial health and market performance provide critical context to the unfolding situation.\n\nAccording to InvestingPro data, Novavax holds a market capitalization of $687.25 million, underscoring the size of the company amidst the biotech sector. Despite a significant return over the last week, with a 14.92% increase in stock price, the company's revenue has seen a substantial decline of 50.36% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2023.\n\nInvestingPro Tips suggest that Novavax's balance sheet holds more cash than debt, which may offer some financial flexibility in the short term. Still, the company is reportedly quickly burning through its cash reserves, which could raise concerns about long-term sustainability. Analysts also anticipate a sales decline in the current year, which aligns with Shah Capital's concerns regarding the company's direction and performance.\n\nFor investors and stockholders seeking to delve deeper into Novavax's financial metrics and future prospects, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights.

{"id": 225063410, "title": "A photo that sunk a political career", "text": "The video footage and photos of a boxing match then-MP Justin Trudeau fought with Conservative Sen. Patrick Brazeau in 2012, along with media descriptions of the event, seemed to markedly sway public opinion about the Liberal MP. A jubilant Trudeau was pictured standing on top of the ring with his glove in the air after his victory. Another photo showed him kissing his then-wife in triumph. Elise Maiolino, a researcher who eventually went on to work for the Prime Minister's Office, analyzed 222 national newspaper articles published about the match. She found that Trudeau appeared to be more \"masculine\" than people previously believed, and, in turn, that aided his transformation into someone seen as a suitable leader for the Liberal party. Canadian political history is full of momentous imagery, from professional photography to a new age of memes: \u2014 The portrait of Winston Churchill: Nicknamed \"The Roaring Lion,\" a stern 1941 portrait of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill by Armenian-Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh in the Speaker's Chamber of the House of Commons became one of the most iconic of the 20th century. Karsh snapped the photo after Churchill delivered his historic \"some chicken, some neck\" speech on the Second World War to Canadian parliamentarians. \u2014 Pierre Trudeau\u2019s pirouette: A photo of Pierre Elliott Trudeau pirouetting at Buckingham Palace during a visit in 1977 would make its way across the world. Trudeau was standing feet away from what appeared to be Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 her back toward the camera \u2014 while his right arm was lifted above his head, his legs in slight movement. Ball, the one who took the picture, said the woman in the image was actually Princess Margaret. \u2014 The 'Shamrock Summit': A 1985 Quebec City meeting between Mulroney and U.S. President Ronald Reagan \u2014 both of Irish descent \u2014 was seen to be a turning point in relations between the two countries. CP photographer Paul Chiasson captured a joyful Mulroney walking side-by-side with Regan down a red carpet as he landed at the Quebec City airport, and TV broadcasts showed the two singing \"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\" together \u2014 a much-repeated anecdote in the decades since. \u2014 The 'Shawinigan handshake': In 1996, former prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien was leaving an event when he was approached by protesters angry about cuts his government was making to unemployment insurance. One of them got in his way. Chr\u00e9tien took labour activist Bill Clennett by the neck in what was nicknamed a \"Shawinigan handshake.\" Clennett did not press charges, and Chr\u00e9tien defended his actions, later joking about them. \u2014 Premier Kenney fills up with gas: Former Alberta premier Jason Kenney staged a photo-op in 2022 to announce temporary measures to the gas tax as his popularity was plummeting, and as he was facing a leadership review \u2014 but it didn\u2019t go as planned. Kenney attempted to fill his blue Dodge Ram with gasoline, but repeatedly failed to pull the pump\u2019s nozzle from its gas tank and had trouble paying with his credit card. It became a meme, and months later, Kenney stepped down. \u2014 Premier Kinew changes a tire: A photo of Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew offering roadside assistance in April has, for many, come to define him. In the image-turned-meme, he is seen kneeling on the side of a dirt road changing a tire. Indigenous Peoples in Manitoba began editing Kinew into other photos: picking berries in a field, stocking beads in a store, fitting a ribbon skirt, and taking bannock out of the oven.

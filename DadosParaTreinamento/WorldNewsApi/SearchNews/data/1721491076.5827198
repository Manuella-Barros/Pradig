{"id": 237082210, "title": "Illinois Democrats defend state budget amid Republican criticism", "text": "Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) recently approved a $53.1 billion state budget that garnered criticism from Republican opponents due to its increased spending. Despite generating approximately $1.2 billion in new taxes, Democrats argue the fiscal plan for Illinois\u2019s upcoming year remains both balanced and responsible, asserting that these taxes will have minimal impact on individual finances. Pritzker highlighted his sixth consecutive balanced budget, emphasizing a 1.6% increase over this year\u2019s spending and a 32% rise since his first budget in 2019, all \u201cwhile putting money back in the pockets of everyday Illinoisans.\u201d To bridge the gap for the fiscal year starting July 1, there will be a total of $725 million in tax increases on sports betting, video gambling, and an enduring restriction on businesses\u2019 ability to offset operating losses, aiming to address the financial deficit. \u201cThere weren\u2019t tax increases or revenue enhancements against everyday ordinary taxpayers,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Elgie Sims said. \u201cWhat you saw was a recognition of, particularly as it relates to the sports betting industry, the explosion of the industry and some parity.\u201d Sims also pointed out the budget\u2019s tax breaks, including an increase in the income tax personal exemption to $2,775 for 2024 and the elimination of the 1% sales tax on groceries in 2026. Additionally, low-income families with at least one child under 12 are eligible for a new child tax credit equivalent to 20% of the earned income tax credit, increasing to 40% next year. Here are some of the takeaways from the tax changes: Sports wagering \u2014 $200 million Taxes on sportsbooks have transitioned from a flat 15% to a graduated scale with five different levels, ranging from 20% on adjusted gross revenue below $30 million to 40% on gross revenue exceeding $200 million. Sportsbook representatives have threatened to leave the state instead of accepting the increased fees, but Pritzker seemed to cast away those comments as bluffs. \u201cThey\u2019re not leaving New York, and they\u2019re not leaving the other states,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe had a much lower tax rate than many of the largest of those markets. And we\u2019re just kind of bringing ourselves more in line but at a lower rate.\u201d Operating losses capped for businesses at $526 million Businesses will be limited to writing off a maximum of $500,000 for operating losses in a given year, but they can spread out and deduct those losses over a period of 15 years. Remote seller sales tax \u2014 $400 million Retailers shipping out-of-state to fulfill remote orders must collect both the 6.25% state sales tax and any applicable local tax at the destination. Retailers\u2019 discount capped \u2014 $101 million Starting Jan. 1, 2025, retail store operators must collect the state\u2019s 6.25% sales tax and local taxes on purchases, with a capped administrative cost discount of $1,000 per month. In return, credit card fees on sales tax are limited. Additional tax changes Income from video gambling, previously taxed at 34% with 29% allocated for state construction projects and 5% for local municipalities, will now be taxed at 35% to support state construction. It is expected to bring in another $35 million. The rerenters hotel tax is earmarked at $25 million. Online hospitality retailers purchasing hotel rooms at a discount and reselling them at a higher price will now be required to collect state hotel tax on the price difference instead of just paying tax on the original hotel charge. Leasing property will now be subject to sales tax, expected to bring in $20 million, with certain exemptions for cases in Chicago already subject to a local lease tax before 2023.", "summary": "Gov.

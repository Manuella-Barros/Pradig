Never more than the last few as the club\u2019s redevelopment plan for The Showgrounds really gathered pace. Gorman was one of the driving forces, to the forefront of safeguarding Sligo\u2019s future yet still somehow in the background. These friends have needed plenty of walks in recent times. Knocknarea was a favourite destination, so too Lissadell and over to Benbulbin. But the beach at Rosses Point was the go-to. \u201cSomewhere to clear the head and to think,\u201d Higgins says. Even the morning after Gorman married his beloved wife, Ceara, it was on the beach at Rosses Point that he gathered some of his closest friends for a game of football, as was remembered by Jim Gray in one of numerous tributes to the former RT\u00c9 broadcaster who passed away at the age of 68 earlier this week. He came to prominence on our screens after moving to Brussels to become Europe Editor in 1989. When he was made Northern Editor in 2001, it was a position he held for 20 years before retiring. \u201cCredibility is the word for Tommie,\u201d Higgins says. \u201cEveryone knew him in this community but the credibility he had as a person all over Ireland and the credibility of his word meant he was able to open so many doors. \u201cTommie had no ego and was engrossed in the club. He has been so vital for everyone in driving the stadium plans.\u201d Relentless, passionate, and determined. They are the traits that define a love affair with Sligo Rovers that started as a child and will live on because of the work he did right up until his death. Last Wednesday, for example, Gorman and Higgins paid a visit to the bank in the town to go over some figures for their application to the Large Scale Sports Infrastructure Fund. The \u20ac17 million redvelopment of The Showgrounds recieved planning permission from the countil council last year and this Monday will be another momentous day as they make their final submission. Everything has been geared towards making sure it is a flawless presentation.

Tommie was the one giving us all the instructions. Do this, do that, get this, get that. He was the life and soul of it. He was going to the hospital the next day but he was still texting everybody that day asking how we were doing. \u201cTommie always made sure things were done right, having everything in place to leave the club in a better place 50 years from now. He was the one who said about getting the stadium sorted because if we don\u2019t the club would slide back the way, we had to do this for the good of the club. It was always about the good of the club for Tommie. \u201cAnd we\u2019re now twice as motivated than ever with this submission on Monday to get the stadium done for Tommie. He was so intrumental in getting us to this stage. \u201cIt\u2019s just been devastating since we got the news because nobody expected this to happen. It\u2019s heartbreaking for us all and absolutely heartbreaking for his family.\u201d Gorman\u2019s funeral is today and he will pass The Showgrounds on his final journey. When details were released earlier in the week a line caught the eye of many. \u201cFamily flowers only. Donations in lieu, if desired, to the Sligo Rovers Stadium Development Fund.\u201d Some also noted how it was fitting that last night\u2019s home game with Shamrock Rovers was not on the usual Saturday night in Sligo. The Bit O\u2019Red won 2-0. \u201cTommie would have been shouting and jumping like the rest of us,\u201d Higgins says. In a first-person piece with The Irish Times during the Covid-19 pandemic, he wrote poignantly under the headline, My Sporting Passion: Tommie Gorman on his enduring love for Sligo Rovers \u201cI can\u2019t remember my first time in the Showgrounds in much the same way that I can\u2019t remember my first time in our kitchen or living room. It feels as if the place has always been part of who I am. Life begins and ends with the Rovers. \u201cWhy does Sligo Rovers matter so much to me? It is deeper than logic. Even now, when I drive into Sligo and see those floodlights an hour before the match starts: it is like catching sight of your spiritual life. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to seeing the soul of the town. Rovers are a perfect fit for Sligo because of the flaws. We are never the finished article.\u201d Gorman\u2019s dedication will ensure they will go some way to getting there.", "summary": "Much-loved and respected RT\u00c9 broadcaster was a driving force behind club\u2019s redevelopment plans before his death this week.", "url": "https://www.the42.ie/tommie-gorman-sligo-rovers-6421454-Jun2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6421454/river/?height=400&version=6421920", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:56", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.391}

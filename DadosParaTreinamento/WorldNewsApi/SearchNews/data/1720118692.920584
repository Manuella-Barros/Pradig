Shyam Lal Kesar apprised that registration of hotels, guest houses is being done by Tourism department right from the time but all of sudden they are observing that department has stopped registration and renewals of Tourism units (Hotels/Guest Houses) on one pretext or the other whereas in Industries department even the registration is done once and no renewal is required thereafter and requested that when whole Union Territory of J&K is moving towards ease of doing business and when hotels have come under Department of Industries. Virender Kesar said that Tourism department should utilize its full energies in developing the sector in the Union Territory including publicizing of places of Tourist interests, exploring the new destinations in the Union Territory besides bringing more and more Tourists in the UT so that this industry flourish and may not die down and the registration process should be eased out. Mudgal however, assured that sympathetic consideration will be given to the concerns raised and will surely be addressed by taking them up at the right quarters.", "summary": "<p>SRINAGAR, June 2: The members of Hotels and Restaurants Association, Katra (HRAK) on Sunday sought increase of stay for Vaishno Devi pilgrims while submitting a memorandum to Commissioner-cum-Secretary Tourism Yasha Mudgal.

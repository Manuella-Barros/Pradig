They also asked about the age of the youngest child being exploited in this way and identified three 10 year-olds and numerous 11 year-olds \u2013 Primary School pupils. 1 Police Scotland did not respond to the Metro survey, but from social media comments by locals in Auchinleck and Cumnock (East Ayrshire) last November, it was known that a County Lines gang from Bradford in England was recruiting children including one 11 year-old. 2 Local groups of youth seem to have driven the Bradford gang out and judging by local media, the towns are now quiet. I\u2019m not aware of any other town where that has been achieved. To this day, Scotland\u2019s MSM including, of course, BBC Scotland will not cover this phenomenon. It looks bad for the Union. In April, I wrote in more detail: I have a google alert for \u2018county lines.\u2019 Every day I get links to media reports on that, across England and Wales. I haven\u2019t had one by a Scottish media outlet. BBC Scotland have not mentioned them since 2021, and only once then. From Yorkshire Live, 19 April 2024: Bradford gang spread misery and class As in huge county lines operation. A Bradford county lines gang who spread drugs and misery throughout a town and city in East Yorkshire has been jailed. \u2018Bradford\u2019 reminded me of the November 2023 \u2018riots\u2019 in Auchinleck and Cumnock (East Ayrshire) and the local reports ignored by the media: and: Also, in comments under previous TuS posts we see this kind of comment: I live in Cumnock, next town along, about a mile from Auchinleck. The protests were local communities rallying against drug dealing gangs \u201ccuckooing\u201d in the houses of people in the area. Auchinleck, Cumnock and Catrine I have heard specifically. These gangs are purported to be from the Bradford area. Some of the things they are alleged to have done are, giving young girls drugs then photographing them in indecent poses while they are \u201cout of it\u201d. We are talking 13 / 14 year olds locking two young boys in a room to fight , the winner gets free drugs making a young woman put a firework in her trouser pocket and setting it off in exchange for drugs threatening to rape and groping women on the street The police have been present in riot gear as the protests could quite easily turn very nasty but as previously stated the context of why these protests and gatherings are taking place are not being reported. There\u2019s clearly a gap here between what locals know and what our MSM is prepared to talk about if it might be seen to be racist or to weaken the case for the Union. Imagine if these were Scottish drug gangs terrorising small town England. You can see the headlines without much thought.

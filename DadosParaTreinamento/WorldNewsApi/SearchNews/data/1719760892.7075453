However, billing systems have not been able to keep up. Many are built for limited use cases (subscription only, PLG only, or usage only), and are built outside of CPQs. This has created fragmented billing operations, which excludes companies from the full revenue advantages of hybrid models. Any changes in channel or pricing require constant manual intervention from finance to ensure alignment between the price, quote, final bill, and revenue recognition. The CPQ/billing disconnect also means CFOs have an unclear picture of revenue and the full value of customers across upsells and cross-sells. With finance needing to pivot between multiple systems, it is nearly impossible to accurately forecast, budget and react quickly to industry changes. \u201cThe biggest mistake we see companies make is using separate systems for each step in the customer lifecycle,\u201d says Nue CEO Mark Walker. \u201cSales chooses a CPQ, finance chooses a billing system, engineering builds a PLG experience on Stripe \u2013 and then they try to get them working together only to bloat operational costs. With Nue, everything is unified. We bring all revenue models under one quote-to-revenue platform, one unified data model and single pricing engine. The minute you can quote across any revenue model, you can bill.\u201d Everything Billing Accelerates Finance with Agile and Unified Operations Everything Billing is an enterprise-grade engine built for all revenue models, pricing complexity and billing agility, without creating messy data in the process.

They're especially focused on travel rewards, like those offered by airline-branded credit cards that let users rack up frequent flyer miles. Forty-one percent of Americans have travel rewards credit cards, according to a NerdWallet survey last year.\n\n\"We're going to look into how we can make sure companies are being straightforward about what people will get from these frequent flyer miles or loyalty programs when they sign up, and whether people are actually getting the deal that they were promised,\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe heightened scrutiny on credit card rewards is part of the White House's broader crackdown on \"junk fees\" and other pricing practices, particularly in industries like financial services and airlines, that the administration sees as unfairly squeezing consumers and contributing to inflation.\n\nIn March, the CFPB lowered the late fees that credit card companies charge, drawing swift industry pushback. Two weeks ago, the Transportation Department said it would require airlines to quickly give cash refunds to passengers whose flights are canceled or seriously delayed.\n\nThe CFPB, with purview over financial institutions, has cracked down on banks for credit card sign-up bonuses before. Last July, it ordered Bank of America to pay more than $100 million for practices including withholding or denying bonus points to tens of thousands of consumers.\n\nFederal regulators are now looking more closely at airline credit cards too. With annual fees as high as $650 and average interest rates of 25.3%, according to LendingTree, they can be much costlier than the average credit card, which in many cases have no annual fees and charge comparatively lower rates, averaging 24.7%.\n\nCFPB Director Rohit Chopra told NBC News prior to the hearing that federal authorities could consider regulations, or even law enforcement actions, if they determine companies are breaking their promises to consumers.\n\n\"We see that for many of these airline rewards programs, credit card companies are charging huge interest rates, sometimes 30% or more. And many consumers actually lose out on these deals. They may be paying way more than the value of the rewards that they accrue,\" Chopra said.\n\nEven if consumers are able to pay their bills on time and avoid interest payments, consumers have complained about restrictions on using the points they've accrued.\n\nButtigieg told NBC News ahead of Thursday's hearing that he had concerns about \"abrupt changes\" in the value of points, given the airlines' control over how many points a flight from, say, New York to Honolulu might cost.\n\nAirlines for America, a coalition representing the nation's largest airlines, said Thursday that there is \"fierce competition\" within the industry for credit card loyalty, adding that \"consumers have the power of choice when picking a carrier for air travel or a credit card for spending, with a wide range of options, to pick what best fits their needs.\"\n\nThe Electronic Payments Coalition, representing credit unions, community banks and payment card networks, points to CFPB data showing the value of rewards points has risen from an average 1.4 cents per dollar spent in 2019 to 1.6 cents in 2022. In a statement Thursday, the group described regulators' scrutiny of credit card rewards as \"politically motivated.\"\n\nLoyalty programs, which sell points back to consumers at prices they set, have been a big source of revenue for major airlines.\n\nDelta Air Lines said it brought in $6.5 billion in revenue linked to its loyalty programs just last year, and American Airlines said 80% of its revenue this year will come from loyalty program members. When United Airlines pledged its entire loyalty program for a loan in 2020, it valued the asset at $21.9 billion.\n\nLauren Randall, who lives in Norwalk, Connecticut, told NBC News she recently applied for a travel credit card that offered 40,000 miles at sign-up, only to receive a promotion in the mail just hours later for the very same card offering 60,000 points. She said she called to see if she could receive the better promo but was denied, calling it a \"bait and switch.\"\n\n\"It feels like every year, either the seats get smaller, or the prices go up, or there's some sort of excuse,\" Randall said. \"It would be great to hold these companies more accountable for the experience and what they promise.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent-flyer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frequent-flyer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NerdWallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NerdWallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlines_for_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airlines for America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Promotion (marketing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honolulu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Honolulu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwalk,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwalk, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwalk, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Phone_Cards_-_Phone_Service_Reps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Phone Cards -

The DOT is just beginning to explore the issues around airline credit card rewards programs and has not reached any conclusions, he added.\n\nCredit cards are the most common consumer lending product in the United States, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. More than 550 million cards are in circulation in the U.S., with Americans now carrying a record $1+ trillion in debt.\n\n\"Most of us have witnessed the advertising online, in our mailboxes, on television and even while seated on an airplane about airline-branded credit cards that make promises about frequent flier mile sign-up bonuses, free round trips for you and your family and other travel perks,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said at the hearing.\n\nHe said frequent flyer programs have evolved from a perk for airlines' most loyal customers into a multibillion-dollar currency market that are \"major assets and competitive weapons for airlines and credit card companies alike.\"\n\nChopra said an initial review by the agency found that large credit card issuers charge significantly higher rates on reward cards and that cardholders who carry a balance can wipe out the benefits of the rewards they signed up to get.\n\nThe CFPB's goal, he said, is to protect people's points from being devalued, to stop bait-and-switch tactics that prevent consumers from being able to tap the rewards they signed up for and to level the playing field between large and small airlines and banks to promote competition on interest rates.\n\nFrequent flier programs date back to the early 1980s after the airline industry was deregulated. Today, the top three U.S. airlines enroll about 100 million members in rewards programs.\n\nAccording to the American Economic Liberties Project, almost a third of all payment transactions in the U.S. now involve credit cards, and 90% of those transactions involve cards offering rewards.\n\n\"For the largest carriers, loyalty programs -- not anything related to flying planes -- generate between 30% and 80% of their revenue,\" said Morgan Harper, director of policy and advocacy for the American Economic Liberties Project. \"Credit card issuers fund rewards through the huge income they generate from interest, annual fees, late fees and interchange\" fees banks charge for accepting electronic payments.\n\nEvery airline, except for Delta, spends more on operations than they earn in selling passenger seats, according to Sarah Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants.\n\n\"The way these airlines reach profitability is through these credit card plans and through their cargo programs mostly,\" Nelson said.\n\nWhile airline reward programs began as a reward for consumers who dedicated their business to a certain airline, they often incentivize debt, she said.\n\n\"People like earning rewards, but what we've seen is that their efforts to earn them are no guarantee that they're going to keep them or that they can use them in the way that was originally promised,\" said Erin Witte, director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America.\n\nShe said airlines often unilaterally change the terms of their rewards, devalue points and remove perks. She encouraged the DOT and CFPB to look at ways to improve fairness and predictability.\n\nAirline competition is like a three-legged stool, said Matthew Klein, executive vice president and chief commercial officer of the ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines.\n\n\"Airline loyalty programs coupled with the banking partner rewards cards make up one part of that stool,\" he said. \"Another leg is airport real estate, and the third leg is the pricing power ultimately gained through the dominance of international and business traffic.\"\n\nKlein said the larger airlines make it difficult for players like Spirit to enter new markets or to sustain the airline reward programs that a large number of fliers now use.\n\n\"In the long run, it's the customer who loses out,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bait-and-switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Economic_Liberties_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Economic Liberties Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent-flyer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frequent-flyer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devaluation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devaluation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/airline_credit_card_lede", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554550", "eventUri": "eng-9554550", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6549019607843136, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

And how much do you need to spend to get the best rewards?\n\nIf you're not sure, you're probably not alone. The terms and conditions of such card programs can be confusing and in some instances they can be changed at any time.\n\nThose were two of the issues discussed at a joint hearing held Thursday by the Department of Transportation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in an effort to examine ways to improve consumers' experience with -- and financial return from -- the popular programs that can generate huge revenue for large airlines.\n\n\"For many families looking to finance a trip or a vacation, those [credit card] benefits are really valuable. ... It's almost seen as savings - something in the bank that you will be able to spend,\" said Rohit Chopra, CFPB's director. \"[But] our review of all the fine print suggests that credit card companies and airlines have the power to quickly and dramatically devalue those points by making it more challenging to redeem them. ... This creates confusion over the true value of the points and raises some questions about fairness.\"\n\nIn some instances, Chopra added, consumers may pay fees for rewards cards \"without a clear option to get a refund\" when benefits get stripped away.\n\nAlso raised at the hearing was concern for consumers who use rewards cards to carry revolving debt.\n\n\"Consumers with revolving debts on average pay far more in interest and fees than they get back in rewards,\" according to a CFPB report released Thursday.\n\nThe hearing featured Chopra and Secretary of Transportation Peter Buttigieg, as well as a panel of consumer advocates and representatives from a few small airlines, a small credit union and a small bank. No one from the major airlines or the top 10 credit card issuing banks was present, although many had been invited, according to CFPB and DOT officials.\n\nBefore the hearing started, however, Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, put out a statement.\n\n\"The credit card market in the U.S. is highly competitive, and consumers have hundreds of card issuers and thousands of card reward programs to choose from\" Nichols said, citing a Morning Consult survey that indicated 80% of credit card users have at least one credit card offering rewards and that the vast majority say they value them.\n\nNichols also cited a bill in Congress that has been strongly opposed by banks, which aims to lower so-called \"interchange fees,\" which is revenue that banks make on credit card transactions. Such a drop in revenue, banks argue, could jeopardize the availability of rewards programs.\n\nAfter the hearing, Jaret Seiberg, a financial services analyst for TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a note that he expects the reason for the event is \"building the foundation for the CFPB to force changes to airline reward credit cards by ensuring already earned miles cannot be devalued and by preventing airline miles from expiring.\"\n\nBut, Seiberg added, \"Our expectation remains that the ultimate outcome here is likely tied to the election. We see the CFPB and DOT moving forward if President Biden wins while it is less likely that Trump-controlled agencies would act.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

I especially want to thank Secretary Pete Buttigieg for convening today's forum with me. The CFPB and the Department of Transportation share responsibility for enforcing a number of laws. The Secretary has taken actions that will benefit so many families, including the latest automatic refund rule and work to combat junk fees. Our agencies are now going to work closely together on credit cards.\n\nCredit cards are the most common lending product in America, with more than 550 million cards in circulation and more than a trillion dollars in outstanding debt. Unlike mortgages or auto loans, where you typically know how much you'll borrow and the monthly payment, credit cards are different. When you take out a credit card, you may have no debt at all. In fact, you may be primarily using it as a payment device with the goal of paying your balance off each month.\n\nThat's why credit card companies have focused heavily on ways to bait people using features other than the interest rate and fees they charge. For example, before Congress banned the practice, it was common for credit card companies to bombard college campuses, giving away free t-shirts and university-branded merchandise for sign-ups at freshman orientations.\n\nMore recently, we've seen credit card rewards taking center stage in the industry's marketing campaigns, particularly in the form of frequent flyer miles and other proprietary points programs. The largest and most dominant airlines play a massive role in this market. Most of us have witnessed the blitz of advertising online, in our mailboxes, on television, and even while seated on an airplane, about airline-branded credit cards that make promises about frequent flyer mile sign-up bonuses, free roundtrips, and other travel perks. For many families looking to finance a trip or vacation, these benefits can be very valuable.\n\nHowever, frequent flyer programs have evolved from a perk for an airline's most loyal customers to a multibillion-dollar currency market where credit card companies and airlines buy, sell, convert, and issue miles and points throughout sectors of the economy. Miles and points can be purchased with cash, earned, and redeemed for shopping on items entirely unrelated to flying. These points programs are major assets and competitive weapons for big airlines and big credit card companies alike.\n\nThe CFPB has been carefully studying this market, and we have a number of goals for this market.\n\nProtecting People's Points Against Currency Devaluation: When Americans sign up for rewards credit cards, they intuitively assign a monetary value to those points that make signing up and spending worthwhile. However, our initial review of the fine print suggests that credit card companies and airlines have the power to quickly and dramatically devalue those points by making it more challenging to redeem them or by limiting the inventory that can be purchased with points. We have also observed that airlines sell points to consumers at inflated rates, while selling those same points to credit card issuers at a much lower price. This not only creates confusion about the true value of the points, but also raises questions about fairness.\n\nStopping Bait-and-Switch Scams: As travel resumed in the aftermath of the pandemic, credit card companies ramped up their marketing on rewards, given the pent-up demand for family travel. However, some consumers have experienced a bait-and-switch, where credit card companies promised rewards, but didn't come through. Consumers may even pay hefty annual fees, but may find that certain benefits may be stripped away without a clear option to get a refund. While credit card companies are required to give notice about changes to many key terms and conditions, consumers are concerned about fine print that can be used to take away valuable benefits and rewards.\n\nExamining Exclusive Deals: The CFPB recently found that small banks and credit unions are offering lower interest rates than the biggest credit card giants. Many of these smaller players would like to offer a range of points and rewards options, just like we see in other industries, like rental cars. However, the largest credit card companies will make massive payments to an airline in exchange for refusing to sell points and miles to competing credit card companies. This has left smaller credit card companies unable to offer competing rewards within the same frequent flyer miles program.\n\nPromoting Competition on Interest Rates: In 2022, Americans paid a record $130 billion in interest and fees on credit cards. Our initial review is that many large credit card issuers charge dramatically higher interest rates on rewards cards compared to non-rewards cards. For cardholders that carry a balance, this can wipe out all of the benefits of rewards. These same large credit card companies often offer a different card product with a lower rate, but they typically avoid proactively informing their cardholders about opportunities to save money by switching to the lower rate. Hefty balance transfer fees can also pose major roadblocks for consumers to take their business elsewhere, which can impede competition.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from our witnesses today to better understand more about credit card rewards and airline frequent flyer miles programs. This will help to inform actions that the CFPB and Department of Transportation may take to protect people's points, to stop bait-and-switch scams, and to promote a fair and competitive market.

They're especially focused on travel rewards, like those offered by airline-branded credit cards that let users rack up frequent flyer miles. Forty-one percent of Americans have travel rewards credit cards, according to a NerdWallet survey last year.\n\n\"We're going to look into how we can make sure companies are being straightforward about what people will get from these frequent flyer miles or loyalty programs when they sign up, and whether people are actually getting the deal that they were promised,\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe heightened scrutiny on credit card rewards is part of the White House's broader crackdown on \"junk fees\" and other pricing practices, particularly in industries like financial services and airlines, that the administration sees as unfairly squeezing consumers and contributing to inflation.\n\nIn March, the CFPB lowered the late fees that credit card companies charge, drawing swift industry pushback. Two weeks ago, the Transportation Department said it would require airlines to quickly give cash refunds to passengers whose flights are canceled or seriously delayed.\n\nThe CFPB, with purview over financial institutions, has cracked down on banks for credit card sign-up bonuses before. Last July, it ordered Bank of America to pay more than $100 million for practices including withholding or denying bonus points to tens of thousands of consumers.\n\nFederal regulators are now looking more closely at airline credit cards too. With annual fees as high as $650 and average interest rates of 25.3%, according to LendingTree, they can be much costlier than the average credit card, which in many cases have no annual fees and charge comparatively lower rates, averaging 24.7%.\n\nCFPB Director Rohit Chopra told NBC News prior to the hearing that federal authorities could consider regulations, or even law enforcement actions, if they determine companies are breaking their promises to consumers.\n\n\"We see that for many of these airline rewards programs, credit card companies are charging huge interest rates, sometimes 30% or more. And many consumers actually lose out on these deals. They may be paying way more than the value of the rewards that they accrue,\" Chopra said.\n\nEven if consumers are able to pay their bills on time and avoid interest payments, consumers have complained about restrictions on using the points they've accrued.\n\nButtigieg told NBC News ahead of Thursday's hearing that he had concerns about \"abrupt changes\" in the value of points, given the airlines' control over how many points a flight from, say, New York to Honolulu might cost.\n\nAirlines for America, a coalition representing the nation's largest airlines, said Thursday that there is \"fierce competition\" within the industry for credit card loyalty, adding that \"consumers have the power of choice when picking a carrier for air travel or a credit card for spending, with a wide range of options, to pick what best fits their needs.\"\n\nThe Electronic Payments Coalition, representing credit unions, community banks and payment card networks, points to CFPB data showing the value of rewards points has risen from an average 1.4 cents per dollar spent in 2019 to 1.6 cents in 2022. In a statement Thursday, the group described regulators' scrutiny of credit card rewards as \"politically motivated.\"\n\nLoyalty programs, which sell points back to consumers at prices they set, have been a big source of revenue for major airlines.\n\nDelta Air Lines said it brought in $6.5 billion in revenue linked to its loyalty programs just last year, and American Airlines said 80% of its revenue this year will come from loyalty program members. When United Airlines pledged its entire loyalty program for a loan in 2020, it valued the asset at $21.9 billion.\n\nLauren Randall, who lives in Norwalk, Connecticut, told NBC News she recently applied for a travel credit card that offered 40,000 miles at sign-up, only to receive a promotion in the mail just hours later for the very same card offering 60,000 points. She said she called to see if she could receive the better promo but was denied, calling it a \"bait and switch.\"\n\n\"It feels like every year, either the seats get smaller, or the prices go up, or there's some sort of excuse,\" Randall said. \"It would be great to hold these companies more accountable for the experience and what they promise.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType":

This morning's U.S. Department of Transportation and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau hearing on airline rewards credit cards focused on the roadblocks consumers face in navigating their points programs, including difficulties in redeeming rewards and programs with changing rules.\n\n\"Credit card companies promise upfront benefits for signing up and using their rewards card, but often bury complex terms in the fine print for using the rewards,\" said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. \"The CFPB will be looking for ways to protect people's points, stop bait-and-switch scams, and promote a fair and competitive market for credit card rewards.\"\n\nThe hearing highlighted the intense competition in this area. Sara Nelson, International President of the Association of Flight Attendants, noted that operating costs exceed passenger revenue for every major airline except Delta, indicating that profits largely stem from credit cards and reward points.\n\n\"Airline rewards programs are a major component of the economics of air travel and are a strong driver for customer retention,\" said Ben Danner, Senior Analyst, Credit and Commercial for Javelin Strategy & Research.\n\nThis landscape presents both opportunities and obstacles for smaller airlines, who see a chance to attract disgruntled passengers dissatisfied with their current airline rewards programs. During the hearing, Scott D'Angelo, Chief Marketing Officer for Allegiant Airlines, said that a passenger survey found that 95% of respondents wanted to participate in a frequent flier program. But 85% also said that they never got any benefits from other airlines' frequent flier programs.\n\nLeaders from smaller financial institutions echoed the notion that they have to adapt to compete against larger lenders. \"The larger players can do things much more efficiently,\" said Andrew Grimm, President and CEO of Apple Credit Union. \"They have relationships with more partners and retailers, and that's something we can't do.\"\n\nGrimm said credit unions like his have ramped up their customer service, especially in areas of stability, as a means of competing with larger institutions. \"Our competitors are giving rewards that they can't sustain if there are changes in the economy,\" he said. \"We do not change what we promise.\"\n\nEver-changing rules and rewards were among the primary concerns noted by the CFPB. \"Consumers tell the CFPB that rewards are often devalued or denied even after program terms are met,\" the agency stated in a press release accompanying the hearings. \"Credit card companies often use rewards programs as a 'bait and switch' by burying terms in vague language or fine print and changing the value of rewards after people sign up and earn them.\"\n\n\"Issuers must take control of their digital footprint for rewards programs,\" said Javelin's Danner. \"Several third-party websites provide card information to consumers that may be outdated, with current plans and intro offers leading to confusion and frustration down the road. Through our own efforts of building a card benchmarking tool, we've seen how difficult it can be for the consumer to compare programs, especially when key components such as redemption values are constantly changing.\"\n\nWhile there were no immediate changes resulting from the hearing, lenders and airlines should be aware that their programs are under heavy scrutiny. \"Points systems like frequent flyer programs have become an increasingly significant part of our economy,\" said Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg in his introduction. \"It's clear that these programs have a great deal of value. And like anything of value, it's important they be treated fairly.\"", "source": {"uri": "paymentsjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PaymentsJournal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_nawrocki@paymentsjournal.com", "name": "Tom Nawrocki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Nelson_(union_leader)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sara Nelson (union leader)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bait-and-switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Flight_Attendants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Flight Attendants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Air", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent-flyer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequent-flyer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.paymentsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/plane-513641_960_720.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554550", "eventUri": "eng-9554550", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.607843137254902, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The report highlighted the danger of consumers choosing cards with higher APRs for the points and perks alone who then end up carrying a balance.\n\nWith total credit card debt at an all-time high, topping $1.1 trillion at the end of last year, Chopra said there was good reason to question issuers' heavy focus \"on ways to entice customers using features other than the real cost of credit, the interest rate and fees they charge.\"\n\n\"Since these programs by design often can encourage a customer to not choose the product with the lowest price, whether that price is the airfare for a ticket or the annual fee and APR for a credit card, we want to make sure we understand the impact that rewards programs have on competition and market behavior,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nThe hearing is the latest installment in the Biden administration's battle against junk fees, the hidden costs or unexpected fees that critics say add up and obscure the true cost of a good or service.\n\nThe CFPB and other agencies have ramped up efforts to crack down on junk fees, which has been met by resistance from the business community. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups sued to block a CFPB rule to cap credit card late fees at $8.\n\nNotably absent from the hearing were the executives from the biggest players in the airline and credit card industries, including Visa, Mastercard, United Airlines and Americans Airlines, who refused to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about credit card competition last month.\n\nVisa, Mastercard and the advocacy group Electronic Payments Coalition (EPC) are waging an all-out war with retailers and Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) over the senator's Credit Card Competition Act.\n\nThe bill would require the biggest financial institutions -- those with more than $100 billion in assets -- to offer at least two network options to process credit card transactions.\n\nAt least one of those network options cannot be Visa or Mastercard, which currently control a combined 80 percent of the credit card interchange market in the U.S., hence the high-stakes lobbying battle.\n\nThe industry has said that if the bill passes, it will wipe away funding for credit card rewards programs. Nick Simpson, managing director of communications and public affairs at the EPC, urged lawmakers during the public portion of the hearing to oppose the Credit Card Competition Act.\n\n\"Regulatory and legislative threats like the Durbin-Marshall bill will jeopardize these programs, and if they were to be eliminated, small businesses would see fewer customers and tourism-heavy municipalities will see less tax revenue,\" Simpson said.\n\nSpeaking from the Senate floor Wednesday, Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kans.), who co-sponsored the bill with Durbin, decried the \"the Visa-MasterCard duopoly [that] has used money and influence in Washington to turn politicians' eyes away from predatory swipe fees.\"\n\n\"I never could have imagined the uphill battle we'd face up here to do the right thing for doing what's best for hardworking Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck,\" Marshall said.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taylor_giorno@thehill.com", "name": "Taylor Giorno", "type": "author",

The witnesses delved into other thorny topics such as whether airlines are delivering on promised rewards, why flight attendants have to supplement their income by selling credit cards, and if consumers are taking on more debt just to accrue miles and points.\n\nYet competition among airlines -- and whether the money generated from rewards and loyalty programs has made it difficult for small entrants to compete -- captured much of the attention.\n\n\"One of our concerns, of course, is what role that these programs may play in affecting the ability of other players, smaller players or newer players to compete,\" said Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, who co-chaired the hearing. He noted that when the Airline Deregulation Act was enacted in 1978, \"it was confidently predicted that there would be at least 100 major competitive airlines by the turn of the century. Obviously things didn't work [out] that way.\"\n\nThe Transportation Department regulates airlines and monitors potential unfair and deceptive practices. The CFPB has the authority to take action against credit card issuers for engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices related to rewards programs.\n\nThe airline and travel industries as well as credit card issuers are vigorously defending the use of credit card rewards, which are used by roughly 80% of Americans. Rewards programs generate nearly $68 billion in annual consumer spending, according to the American Economic Liberties Project.\n\nCFPB Director Rohit Chopra -- who also co-chaired the hearing -- said that officials of the largest banks and credit card issuers \"did not want to appear in public.\" The event featured mostly smaller players as well as consumer advocates, but didn't include representatives of large airlines or credit card issuers. How credit card rewards programs are marketed to consumers is under scrutiny.\n\n\"What are the ways that consumers can have some reasonable assurance that what they've earned is going to actually be able to be used?\" Chopra asked. \"I really do worry about some of the marketing claims where someone can say even if it's not 'you will' but 'you could' earn something, or get some sort of free round trips, but in reality almost nobody is getting that. That really is at odds with our truth in advertising laws.\"\n\nMatthew Klein, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Spirit Airlines, said rewards programs are harming competition. Smaller airlines offer their own co-branded cards with perks such as priority check-in and free drinks, but they say the bigger airlines can afford to fund much more lucrative perks.\n\n\"The larger airlines here in America now make it extremely difficult for low-fare airlines like Spirit to enter new markets, sustain long-term success when competing to and from the largest airports in this country, and provide better value to customers seeking alternative or lower-cost options,\" Klein said. \"Airline reward programs certainly have an important place in providing value to customers when not used coercively. Unfortunately, with some of the larger carriers, there is a shroud over the trade-off consumers are making from the rewards programs and the amount of cross subsidy that takes place within those programs.\"\n\nLukas Johnson, chief commercial officer at Breeze Airways, which serves small and midsize airports, said rewards programs are \"a huge revenue source for the large airlines.\"\n\nThe airline executives described how customers are trapped traveling to cities dominated by the largest airlines due to the lure of points, upgrades, reward status and lounge access.\n\n\"That's really where the crux of some of this is, is these competition issues,\" said Klein. \"It starts with the axis of the airports, falls into the loyalty programs, and then it becomes very hard for [smaller] airlines to really get in there and have long-term sustainability. I think that's an important part here that we shouldn't be missing along the way with competition and how it all plays together.\"\n\nSara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 100,000 flight attendants or half of the industry, said during the panel discussion that Delta Air Lines generates over 1% of GDP through its Delta SkyMiles personal credit card from American Express.\n\n\"When you have that much money that's involved in the programs that you're running, your whole calculation changes, [and] you actually can't afford to retain all of those rewards,\" Nelson said. \"When we also pair that with the reduction in seat capacity that we've seen in the airlines over time, [they] don't have space to redeem a lot of these rewards [and] then it puts a lot of these bigger players in the position to devalue the rewards that consumers have earned.\"\n\nMany flight attendants rely on rewards programs, which roughly 80% of them advertise through loudspeakers on flights, to subsidize their income. Airlines will pay $5 for handing out a credit card application and between $50 and $100 when an account is activated, Nelson said. But she also described how flight attendants face a backlash from the public.\n\n\"This is a big deal to the traveling public,\" Nelson said. \"The problem is that when these programs are devalued, or they don't deliver on what has been promised, it is often flight attendants that are on the front lines or are receiving the anger from the public and in some cases it adds to problems that we've seen on board [flights] with the violence.\"\n\nMoney generated for airlines and credit card issuers from interchange fees, which merchants pay on credit and debit card purchases, also was a topic raised at the hearing. Some panelists suggested that small airlines can't compete or gain market share because of the massive volume in interchange fees.\n\nSeparately, the banking industry has fiercely opposed a controversial banking bill, co-sponsored by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Roger Marshall, R-Kan., that would require the largest credit card issuers to offer merchants the choice of two unaffiliated card networks, one of which must be a network other than Visa and Mastercard. The legislation is being pitched by lawmakers as saving merchants and consumers $15 billion a year, but issuers claim it would kill credit card rewards programs and hurt consumers.\n\nAt the hearing, Erin Witte -- director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America -- raised concerns about ''bait-and-switch\" practices in which airlines often change the terms and conditions of rewards agreements, or devalue points, but they do so by merely providing consumers with a disclosure.\n\n\"For many years the conversation around this issue has been about how much notice should we give people before we do this. But frankly, I think that's the wrong way to think about this,\" said Witte. \"What's unfair, deceptive and potentially even anticompetitive is that this happens at all, not how much notice is given consumers before they're harmed. A really difficult piece of this puzzle is ascertaining the value of a point, a mile or some other rewards currency.\"\n\nConsumer advocates also claim that rewards programs have become a wealth transfer from low- and moderate-income consumers to the wealthy. Consumers who rely on cash and debit payments end up paying prices that are set by the cost to process payments for high-cost rewards cards, said John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecommunications and fraud at the National Consumer League.\n\n\"Income generated by rewards programs is not considered taxable income, though consumers are spending it just as they would if they were using dollars,\" Breyault said in an interview. \"What is the impact on the government's balance sheet in this tax treatment of rewards?\"\n\nChopra also said that consumers look at their rewards accounts in the same way they view their checking accounts, yet oftentimes the rewards are devalued or not deemable.\n\nAt the hearing, Breyault urged the CFPB and DOT to investigate not just the competitive effects that rewards programs have on banks and airlines, but also on other travel methods like cruise lines and hotels that he said \"are also strongly invested in the rewards ecosystem and also similarly concentrated industries.\"\n\nRichard Hunt, executive chairman of the Electronic Payments Coalition and a former president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, pushed back in a press release in response to the hearing. Low- and moderate-income Americans rely on credit card rewards to make ends meet and manage their family finances, he said.\n\n\"Saying credit card reward programs only help the rich or are just about getting lounge access at the airport is nothing more than willingly ignoring the full picture,\" Hunt said in the release.\n\nFor the largest airlines and credit card issuers, rewards and loyalty programs have evolved into an important revenue sources even as \"the quality and value of the programs has steadily declined, a trend we often see in consolidated industries lacking meaningful competition,\" said Morgan Harper, director of policy and advocacy at the American Economic Liberties Project.\n\nWitte at the Consumer Federation of America, said that reward programs incentivize a lot of credit card spending and may drive more people into debt.\n\n\"People like earning rewards, but what we've seen is that their efforts to earn them are no guarantee that they're going to keep them or that they can use them in the way that was originally promised to them,\" Witte said.", "source": {"uri": "americanbanker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Banker"}, "authors": [],

Biden Admin Probes Credit Card Programs", "body": "White House officials and regulators are probing what they say are issues with airline credit card programs, including the devaluation of points, high interest rates and the stripping of travel benefits.\n\nAmericans tend to have a love-hate relationship with airline credit card programs: Putting day-to-day spending on these cards can feel like an easy way to earn quote-unquote \"free\" trips -- and the perks can make air travel a more luxurious experience -- but officials say they've heard a laundry list of consumer complaints about how these programs are structured and operated.\n\nCredit card and airline reward programs have ballooned in popularity in the last few years amid the post-pandemic rebound in travel: According to one estimate, roughly 30 million Americans have airline credit cards that generate $23 billion a year. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg tells Money that for some big airlines, the profitability of these programs now \"rivals or exceeds that of actually flying planes.\"\n\nConsumers increasingly think of their rewards balances as part of their savings, he says, but what those points are actually worth -- both now and in the future -- is unclear.\n\n\"A lot of us build up our savings in our points accounts just like we do in our cash accounts. But unlike a bank account, your points or miles have a value that could be changed overnight by a company,\" Buttigieg says.\n\nTravel experts discourage fliers from stockpiling large amounts of rewards for exactly this reason: You can get burned if your airline of choice quietly decreases redemption values and you suddenly find that you can no longer afford the trip you've been planning on taking.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) have been researching these issues for months, and they shared some of their findings in a hearing Thursday alongside airline executives, consumer advocates and other stakeholders.\n\nRohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said that among their concerns are:\n\nAnother part of Thursday's hearing touched on the aggressive marketing of these products. Officials were surprised when Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, mentioned that about half of flight attendants are required to make announcements about credit cards on flights.\n\n\"In almost every case, there is an incentive for flight attendants,\" Nelson said. \"There are some flight attendants who are subsidizing their income between $10,000 and $15,000 a year through these programs.\"\n\nWhile flight attendants have mixed feelings about doing this, she added, they shouldn't have to engage in credit card marketing to make enough money to pay rent.\n\nUltimately, the Biden administration wants to see more transparency and fairness around credit card and airline reward programs, Buttigieg tells Money.\n\n\"I think a lot of us have had that experience of being on the plane and when they come around with the credit card pitch, they say, 'This is going to get you X amount of miles, which is enough for two people to go to Hawaii!' And you think, 'I'm going to pay for my next vacation with this,'\" Buttigieg says. \"If they get you to make that decision with that pitch, that pitch better come true.\"\n\nAsked what actions or changes are coming next, Buttigieg says that's still to be determined, but he emphasizes that officials are eager to try to address some of the issues they've identified. The agencies intend to closely scrutinize each major airline's policies as part of the process.\n\n\"We don't have a rule cooked up, ready to go, or anything like that, but this information-gathering can lead to action depending on what we find,\" he says.\n\nMorgan Harper, director of policy and advocacy at the American Economic Liberties Project, urged the CFPB and the DOT to investigate what she described as deceptive and unfair business practices that hurt consumers and discourage competition.\n\n\"Preserving the value of retroactive rewards, standardizing these rewards' value, and requiring transparency about changes to program terms would bring much-needed protections to this market,\" she said.\n\nNot everyone agrees with this approach, though.\n\nIain Murray, vice president for strategy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, wrote in a blog post Thursday that \"millions of Americans use credit card air miles to plan vacations.\" He also linked the hearing to the Credit Card Competition Act, which he wrote could \"interfere with a well-working market\" and hurt rewards programs, setting off a chain reaction that could lead to \"fewer flights, fewer jobs, more crowded flights and higher fares.\"\n\n17 Best Credit Cards of May 2024", "source": {"uri": "money.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Money"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She relies on reward programs with Delta, United and American Airlines.\n\nBut she said recently, there's been a shift.\n\nRead: Teachers are being violently attacked in class; hear what they say needs to be changed\n\n\"The airline programs have actually gotten worse,\" said Greene. \"Where they're not recognizing their most loyal customers and honoring their business customers.\"\n\nBecause of passenger complaints, the Department of Transportation and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are now examining the fairness and transparency of these reward programs.\n\n\"We want to make sure that every family is getting what's promised and that we really have a fair transparent and competitive market,\" said Rohit Chopra, director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\"How we can make sure companies are being straightforward about what people will get from these frequent flyer miles or loyalty programs when they sign up, and whether people are actually getting the deal they were promised,\" said Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Department of Transportation\n\nRead: Corporate 5K in downtown Orlando: What you need to know\n\nOfficials say many reward credit cards have higher annual fees and companies often charge you higher interest rates on reward cards too.\n\nSmaller credit unions say they offer much lower rates but limited rewards because it's tough to compete.\n\n\"The larger institutions can do things much cheaper, more effectively and advertising budget if you watch TV you see a credit card commercial,\" said Andrew Grimm, president and CEO, Apple Federal Credit Union.\n\nBut Airlines for America, which represents major U.S. carriers, argues there is competition.\n\n\"Airline loyalty programs are widely popular, voluntary programs that consumers value because they accumulate rewards toward travel when they make everyday purchases. There is fierce competition within the industry for both customer and credit card loyalty, and consumers have the power of choice when picking a carrier for air travel or a credit card for spending, with a wide range of options, to pick what best fits their needs,\" said an Airlines for America spokesperson in a written statement.\n\nRead: Lazy Moon Pizza to soon open new Maitland location\n\nIn a recent survey, the organization found nearly one out of every four U.S. households has an airline credit card.\n\nSome airlines are also trying to make their points systems easier to understand.\n\n\"We wanted to make it clear that if i show you that you Mr. [Transportation] Secretary have 15,000 points that equals $150 you will see that on all of our communications,\" said Scott DeAngelo, executive vice president at Allegiant Air.\n\nAs for travelers like Greene, she believes customers should be rewarded for the miles they fly each year.\n\n\"Like I flew more miles than you I should be rewarded for my amount of miles that I flew for that year,\" said Greens. \"That's telling you who is flying long distances, that is telling you who is really loyal in those situations.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

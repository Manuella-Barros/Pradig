He said that night that he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\" He said he heard \"a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin\" in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nA week after the shooting, the Trump campaign released a doctor's note from Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson -- who had served as Trump's White House physician -- that said Trump sustained a gunshot wound to his right ear that was \"less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear.\" Trump is \"doing well, and he is recovering as expected,\" Jackson said.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Wray testified before the House Judiciary Committee that it is not yet certain if Trump's injury was caused by a bullet or shrapnel.\n\n\"To the best of your understanding, how close did the assassin's bullet come to killing President Donald Trump?\" California Rep. Kevin Kiley asked Wray.\n\nWray replied that his understanding was that either a bullet or a piece of shrapnel \"is what grazed [Trump's] ear.\"\n\nLater in the hearing, Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee chairman, asked Wray if all eight bullets fired by the gunman had been accounted for.\n\n\"We obviously know that Mr. Comperatore lost his life...two other rally goers were injured, seriously injured, and then the one that hit President Trump.

Speaking at the Republican National Convention just days after the incident, Trump recounted the near-miss.\n\n\"I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear,\" he said. Trump described the bullet as coming \"within a quarter of an inch of taking my life.\"\n\nRep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), Trump's former White House physician, later shared details of his examination of the wound on a conservative talk show.\n\n\"It [the bullet] was far enough away from his head that there was no concussive effect from the bullet, and it just took the top of his ear off,\" Jackson explained.\n\nWray also provided new insights into the investigation, including the revelation that Crooks had researched the distance from which former President John F. Kennedy was shot in 1963, indicating a possible premeditated study of assassination tactics.\n\nAs the testimony unfolded, Trump responded via a post on Truth Social, calling for Wray's resignation.\n\nHowever, his demand was not related to the details of the assassination attempt. Instead, Trump criticised the FBI director for describing his interactions with President Biden as \"uneventful and unremarkable.\"\n\nThe investigation into the assassination attempt continues, with the FBI meticulously examining all aspects of the case to understand the full extent of the threat and to ensure the safety of political figures.", "source": {"uri": "thetrentonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Trent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ima_matthew@thetrentonline.com", "name": "Ima Matthew", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

FBI Director Chris Wray Drops Insane Take on Rally Shooting", "body": "FBI Director Christopher Wray appeared to downplay the July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump by casting doubt on whether he was actually hit by a bullet.\n\nWray made the suggestion twice during his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\nOn its website, the committee said, it wanted to \"examine the FBI's investigation into the assassination attempt against President Trump and the ongoing politicization of the nation's preeminent law enforcement agency under the direction of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland.\"\n\nAt one point, Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley of California asked, \"Director Wray, to the best of your understanding, how close did the assassin's bullet come to killing President Trump?\"\n\nWray replied, \"My understanding is that either it or some shrapnel is what, you know, grazed his ear, so I don't know that I have the actual distance.\"\n\nKilley interjected, \"Very, very close, you would agree?\"\n\nAt another point, House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan asked Wray to account for all the bullets fired during the Trump assassination attempt.\n\n\"Where did all eight bullets go is, I guess, my question,\" the Republican congressman from Ohio said.\n\n\"I don't have that in front of me,\" Wray said, before repeating his speculation that Trump may not have been hit by a bullet.\n\n\"As I said, I think with respect to former President Trump, there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know right now whether that bullet, in addition to causing the grazing, could have landed somewhere else,\" he continued.\n\nIt's unclear whether Wray meant to downplay Trump's injury, but the FBI director's choice of wording sounded like that.\n\nRegardless, it's appalling that almost two weeks after the assassination attempt, Wray has no idea whether the former president was hit by a bullet or by shrapnel.\n\nEven more alarming is the stonewalling from the Secret Service, which has to yet to explain the multiple, egregious security failures that led to Trump getting shot in the first place.\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter whether he was hit by a bullet or by shrapnel, because he could have died either way.\n\nWhile Americans struggle to buy groceries, billions of tax dollars are forked over to the FBI ($11 billion) and the Secret Service ($3 billion) every year. Yet neither agency can account for what happened on July 13.\n\nIf you can't understand what caused a problem, you can't prevent it from happening again.

Kevin Kiley (R-CA), \"My understanding is that either it [a bullet] or some shrapnel is what grazed his ear.\"\n\nHours after the harrowing event which left two rally-goers critically injured and one local retired firefighter dead, Trump shared a message on Truth Social.\n\n\"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear,\" his post read. \"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.\"\n\nDuring his speech later that week at the Republican National Convention, Trump shared a personal account of what he experienced.\n\n\"I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, 'Wow what was that? It can only be a bullet,' \" the former president, wearing a large bandage over his ear, recounted. \"I moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down, my hand was covered with blood. Just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground.\"\n\nIn his testimony before Congress, Wray spoke about other details investigators have found concerning the gunman who had reportedly flown a drone over the area just two hours before the rally.\n\nCrooks also reportedly made several online searches before the shooting, including information about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\"That's a search obviously that is significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally,\" Wray noted.\n\n\"We do not know the motive. That is obviously one of the central questions in our investigation, and it's been very frustrating to us that a lot of the usual kind of low-hanging-fruit places that we would find that have not yielded significant clues about his motive,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nWray's testimony followed the dramatic grilling of now-former Secret Service Director Kim Cheatle before the House Oversight Committee on Monday. She subsequently resigned as the House Homeland Security Committee held a hearing Tuesday. Cheatle did not make an appearance at that hearing and neither did her boss, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said in his opening statement Wednesday. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper while he was perched on a nearby rooftop outside the rally's security perimeter.\n\nWray faced a grilling by the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday over the FBI's investigation into the assassination attempt that occurred on July 13.\n\nHe was asked how close Crooks' bullet came to killing former president Trump to which Mr Wray responded: \"My understanding is that either it or some shrapnel is what...you know grazed his ear so I don't know that I have the actual (measurement).\"\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, Wray again suggested it may have been shrapnel that grazed Trump's ear, rather than a bullet, when he was asked where all eight bullets fired by Crooks ended up.\n\n\"I don't have that in front of me, I'm happy to circle back and get that to you assuming we have that information,\" he said.\n\n\"I think, with respect to former president Trump... there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear.\n\n\"As I sit here right now, I don't know whether that bullet in addition to causing the grazing, could have also landed somewhere else.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson refuted the claims on Thursday, as he also lamented Wray \"was not forthcoming with some of the information that we would expect\".\n\n\"We've all seen the video, we've seen the analysis, we've heard it from multiple sources in different angles that a bullet went through his ear. I'm not sure it matters that much,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson added there was \"a lot of frustration and concern about the leadership with these agencies,\" seemingly referring to the Secret Service in addition to the FBI.\n\nMembers of the Republican Party were left unimpressed by Wray's remark, affirming it was a bullet that struck Trump.\n\n\"Anyone who believes this conspiracy bulls*** is either mentally deficient or wilfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons,\" Trump's campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said.\n\nRepublican and former White House physician Ronny Jackson said the shrapnel claim was \"pathetic!!!\"\n\n\"What little credibility he may have left is gone after recklessly suggesting Trump might not have been hit from a bullet. It was a bullet -- I've seen the wound,\" he posted on X.\n\nTrump has not released medical records from when he was treated at the hospital for his injury.\n\nIn defence of Wray on the other side of the argument, Democratic Party member Dan Goldman said the 78-year-old \"owes it to the American people\" to be honest about what happened.\n\n\"We have not seen any medical records. We have not had a an independent doctor other than a hyper-partisan, elected member of Congress comment on what happened,\" Goldman said, according to NBC News.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The FBI Is Run by a Conspiracy Theorist", "body": "Well, if you needed something else to undermine your faith in the FBI, you have it now.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray couldn't even confirm whether former President Donald Trump was hit by a bullet or just a piece of shrapnel during the attempted assassination.\n\nDespite hours of questioning, Wray claimed twice that the FBI still hasn't figured out what exactly grazed Trump's ear at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He told Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.), \"My understanding is that either it [a bullet] or some shrapnel is what grazed his ear.\" Seems like the FBI is still fumbling around with the basics.\n\nThe Daily Beast:\n\nLater during the hearing, Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asked Wray if investigators knew where all eight bullets fired by Thomas Matthew Crooks ended up after the shooting.\n\n\"There is some question about whether or not it was a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear, so it is conceivable, as I sit here right now, I don't know whether that bullet, in addition to causing the grazing, could have also landed somewhere else,\" Wray testified.\n\nJordan did not follow up with any questions about the shrapnel.\n\nSpeaking at the Republican National Convention just days after the assassination attempt, Trump said the bullet \"came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life.\"\n\n\"I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear,\" the former president described the scene.\n\nTrump's former White House physician, Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), later told a conservative talk show that he examined the wound in the days immediately after the shooting. \"It [the bullet] was far enough away from his head that there was no concussive effect from the bullet, and it just took the top of his ear off.\"\n\nIf that is the FBI's position, we have a problem.\n\nRelated: Trump's Security Detail Believes Lack of Resources Was 'Politically Motivated'\n\nEven the left-wing fact-checking site Snopes has debunked the rumors that Trump was struck by broken glass.\n\nImmediately following the attempted assassination of former U.S. President Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, skepticism over the notion that Trump had actually been hit by a bullet was fueled by anonymously sourced reports that he was \"not struck by a bullet, but hit by glass fragments\" from a teleprompter that had been hit by a bullet.\n\nReporters from both Newsmax and Axios reported on a source making this claim, which was then amplified by other outlets including Raw Story. Some went so far as to call the purported disclosure evidence of a \"stunt.\"\n\nThere was, however, no evidence to suggest anything other than a bullet caused the wound to Trump's ear, and these early reports to the contrary have largely been walked back.\n\nThe assertion that glass, not a bullet, caused the injury is undercut by the fact that photographs show no damage to the teleprompters allegedly hit to produce the broken glass, by a New York Times photograph capturing a bullet passing by Trump's ear, and by the fact that Trump later stated, on Truth Social, that a bullet had, in fact, pierced his ear:\n\nI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin.\n\nTrump's description of his wound matches photographs of his ear after he was hit, prior to being removed from stage.\n\nWhy is it that Snopes can figure out that Trump was, indeed, struck by a bullet, but the FBI can't?

They're both passing by at a relatively high rate of speed,\" said Diaczuk, a professor of forensic science at New York's John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nAdditionally, Diaczuk told BI that it's most likely that it was, in fact, a bullet that hit Trump's ear instead of shrapnel.\n\nIn order for a bullet to break up and cause a fragment, \"it's got to hit something substantial to disrupt its integrity,\" Diaczuk explained.\n\n\"And from what I saw -- clearly, I don't have as much information as people who have been to the scene looking at things -- but from what I saw the day of and the day after, was that it was a clear line of sight between the sniper's nest and the podium,\" said Diaczuk. \"And if that's the case, then there's nothing to cause the breakup of a bullet.\"\n\n\"I don't see any indication of an intervening object to cause the bullet to fragment,\" he said.\n\nRepublican Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, who served as Trump's White House doctor, said in a previously released note that the former president \"sustained a gunshot wound\" that caused \"significant bleeding\" and \"marked swelling\" of his entire upper ear.\n\n\"The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear,\" the memo read. \"The bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down from the cartilaginous surface of the ear.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_musumeci@businessinsider.com", "name": "Natalie Musumeci", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shrapnel shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartridge (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jordan_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jordan (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronny_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronny Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay_College_of_Criminal_Justice", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Jay College of Criminal Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a29252aab37011780a9301?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762749", "eventUri": "eng-9762749", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1161, "textEnd": 1168}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He did not conclusively rule out the possibility that Trump was hit by a bullet.\n\nThough conspiracy theories initially ran rampant in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, most were debunked as new information came to light.

A bullet that seemingly passed behind Trump was even captured in a photo by a New York Times photographer.\n\nWhile some reporters initially claimed that the former president was struck by glass fragments, citing Pennsylvania law enforcement sources, those allegations were quickly dismissed as Trump and law enforcement confirmed that he had been shot.\n\n\"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,\" Trump claimed on Truth Social shortly after the shooting.\n\nThe FBI has taken the lead in an investigation of the incident, including the botched security measures that have already resulted in Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation after a disastrous congressional hearing.\n\nWray shared other details in the hearing, including that Crooks had searched for details on Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination of President John F.

But I believe we\u2019ve accounted for all of the shots in the cartridges.\u201d\n\nJordan followed up, \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that the very first one was the one that hit the president. The very first shot. Or is that not accurate?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I sit here right now, I don\u2019t know the answer to that. I believe we know the answer to that. I just don\u2019t have it in front of me,\u201d Wray responded.\n\nThe gunman \u2013 who was shot dead by the US Secret Service \u2013 opened fire from a rooftop just minutes into Trump\u2019s July 13 rally, leaving the former US president\u2019s ear bloodied, one attendee dead, and two others injured.\n\nWhen asked for comment Thursday regarding Wray\u2019s testimony about there being a question of whether Trump was hit by a bullet or shrapnel, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Business Insider: \u201cAnyone who believes this conspiracy bullshit is either mentally deficient or wilfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons.\u201d\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee, appointed Wray as FBI director in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, firearms expert Peter Diaczuk told BI that whether a bullet or shrapnel struck Trump, both would have done a similar amount of damage to his ear and that the former president would not have known the difference.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both going to rip the ear apart. They\u2019re both passing by at a relatively high rate of speed,\u201d said Diaczuk, a professor of forensic science at New York\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nAdditionally, Diaczuk said that it was most likely that it was, in fact, a bullet that hit Trump\u2019s ear instead of shrapnel.\n\nIn order for a bullet to break up and cause a fragment, \u201cit\u2019s got to hit something substantial to disrupt its integrity\u201d, Diaczuk explained.\n\n\u201cAnd from what I saw \u2013 clearly, I don\u2019t have as much information as people who have been to the scene looking at things \u2013 but from what I saw the day of and the day after, was that it was a clear line of sight between the sniper\u2019s nest and the podium,\u201d said Diaczuk. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s the case, then there\u2019s nothing to cause the break-up of a bullet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any indication of an intervening object to cause the bullet to fragment,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican Texas congressman Ronny Jackson, who served as Trump\u2019s White House doctor, said in a previously released note that the former president \u201csustained a gunshot wound\u201d that caused \u201csignificant bleeding\u201d and \u201cmarked swelling\u201d of his entire upper ear.\n\n\u201cThe bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear,\u201d the memo read. \u201cThe bullet track produced a 2cm (0.8 inch) wide wound that extended down from the cartilaginous surface of the ear.\u201d\n\nOriginally published on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shrapnel shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

But there were also more mainstream figures who suggested that Trump was not hit by a bullet from the would-be assassin's gun but rather a bit of shrapnel that came from...somewhere.\n\nThe first theory held that a bullet had actually shattered a glass teleprompter panel, and a shard of glass then hit Trump's ear. That theory suffered from the fact that the teleprompter panels were not hit by bullets and appeared to be intact after the shooting. But that did not stop the theorists from starting with the glass and going on from there.\n\n\"We still don't know for sure whether Donald Trump was hit by a bullet, whether he was hit by glass fragments, whether he was hit by shrapnel -- we don't have those details,\" MSNBC host Joy Reid said a few days after the assassination attempt. \"We actually have no details from his physician, even though this man is still a Secret Service-protected, you know, presidential candidate. We know almost nothing.\" Reid was also upset that, in her view of things, Trump's Secret Service agents \"allowed\" the former president to stand up after being hit so that he could pose for photos.\n\n\"We don't know why, for nine full seconds, Donald Trump was allowed to stand back up during an active shooting, an active shooter situation, even though they at that point had said the shooter was down. How would they have known if there were more shooters or not?\" Reid said. \"Yet they allowed him to stand up in the middle of that crisis and pose for a photo and fist-pump the air so he could get the iconic photo.\"\n\nClearly Reid has an active imagination. Finally, she questioned the wound that Trump suffered in the shooting. \"What is the actual injury to Donald Trump's ear that is under that bandage?\" she said. \"Shouldn't we know that by now? It's weird.\"\n\nIf you think this sounds a little weird itself, you should know that such speculation is fairly common on the Left and becoming more so every day. No need to list a lot of examples. It's out there.\n\nNow the speculation has received the imprimatur of the director of the FBI. Christopher Wray appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and on two occasions suggested that Trump might have been hit by \"shrapnel.\"\n\nOn one occasion, Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) asked Wray, \"How close did the assassin's bullet come to killing President Trump?\" Wray responded, \"My understanding is that either it or some shrapnel is what, you know, grazed his ear. So I don't know that I have the actual distance.\"\n\nOn another occasion, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), chairman of the committee, asked Wray if the FBI had accounted for all eight bullets thought to have been fired by the shooter and whether some victims might have been hit multiple times. \"I think with respect to former President Trump, there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that, you know, hit his ear, so it's conceivable,\" Wray answered. \"Although, as I sit here right now, I don't know whether that bullet, in addition to, you know, causing the grazing could have also landed somewhere else. But I believe we've accounted for all of the shots and the cartridges.\"\n\nWhat to make of it? Wray did not offer any information on what, if Trump was not hit by a bullet, the shrapnel might have been or how it might have happened. Had he talked to FBI experts who have examined the evidence? He did not say. So what could it mean?\n\nI called Dr. Ronny Jackson, now a Republican congressman from Texas, to find out more. He is a former Obama and Trump White House physician who served more than 20 years in the U.S. Navy, including a stint with a shock trauma unit in Iraq during the worst days of the war there. Gunshots, shrapnel, explosives, whatever -- in Iraq, Jackson treated the terrible wounds they can cause.\n\nAs a congressman, Jackson does not practice medicine. He has let his various licenses lapse, although he is still certified in emergency medicine. His critics have pointed out that he was accused of inappropriate actions while White House physician, which he denies.\n\nIn our conversation, Jackson stressed he is not Trump's doctor. He was not present at the July 13 shooting but joined Trump the day after. He dressed Trump's wound and applied the bandage, which he said anyone could do. But the fact is, he is an experienced doctor, and he saw Trump's wound the day after the shooting. He is certainly qualified to describe it.\n\nJackson told me that the bullet took off a little of the top of Trump's ear and left a wound entirely consistent with a high-velocity gunshot. Jackson also said he read the medical report from the Pennsylvania hospital where Trump was taken after the shooting. Doctors there treated Trump's wound and also gave him a full examination to see if he had suffered any other injury. The hospital medical report, Jackson said, referred to Trump's wound as a gunshot wound. He said not only the appearance of the wound but also the presence of swelling and other symptoms were entirely consistent with a gunshot wound.\n\n\"The reality is, it was a bullet,\" Jackson said. \"It looks like the path of a bullet coming right over the top of his ear.\" When I asked about Jackson's experience with such matters, Jackson cited his time in Iraq and said, \"I believe I know what a gunshot wound looks like.\"\n\nJackson was unhappy with Wray's speculation. \"He shouldn't be making statements like that,\" Jackson said. \"From him, it's an irresponsible statement unless he has some obvious forensic evidence.\"\n\nBut Wray said what he said, and now the speculation from the Joy Reids of the world will only grow. What can be done? The best thing would be for Trump to authorize the doctors who treated him in Pennsylvania to discuss the wound and treatment involved. And there will certainly be more evidence in the future about the events of those few seconds, including the paths of the eight shots investigators believe the would-be assassin fired.\n\nThat information is needed if only for the public's right to know. In the big picture, though, it's not clear what difference confirming the shrapnel theory would make. An assassin intending to kill Trump fired a high-powered rifle at Trump, and Trump was hit by shrapnel from the high-velocity bullet. Does that change anything significant about the story?\n\nFor Reid and her allies, the answer is yes. They are looking for a way to devalorize Trump's actions after the assassination attempt. People were amazed that Trump could be shot and then stand up and gesture defiantly as Secret Service agents hustled him offstage. Remember that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg called Trump's actions \"one of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life.\" That impression is precisely what the Trump theorists are hoping to diminish -- and in the process diminish any political benefit Trump might have reaped from the assassination attempt. For them, it's all politics. Still, more information is better, and the public needs to know more about the events of July 13.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "byron_york@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Byron York", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shrapnel shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunshot_wound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gunshot wound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_to_the_President", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician to the President"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronny_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronny Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The Trump campaign did release a letter from Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, a former White House physician.\n\nJackson ripped Wray in a statement on X. \"What little credibility he may have left is gone after recklessly suggesting Trump might not have been hit from a bullet. It was a bullet -- I've seen the wound. Pathetic!!!\" he wrote in the post, with the last two sentences in all-capital letters.\n\nJackson said in the July 20 letter released by the campaign that he'd evaluated and treated Trump's wound \"daily\" since the shooting.\n\n\"As reported and witnessed by the entire world, he sustained a gunshot wound to the right ear from a high-powered rifle used by the would be assassin,\" Jackson said in the letter.\n\n\"The bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear,\" the letter said, adding that there \"was initially significant bleeding,\" but given \"the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required.\"\n\nRep.

The Trump campaign did release a letter from Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, a former White House physician.\n\nJackson ripped Wray in a statement on X. \"What little credibility he may have left is gone after recklessly suggesting Trump might not have been hit from a bullet. It was a bullet -- I've seen the wound.

He was unable to state definitively whether Trump had been shot.\n\nWray added:\n\nThere is some question about whether or not it was a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear, so it is conceivable, as I sit here right now, I don't know whether that bullet, in addition to causing the grazing, could have also landed somewhere else.\n\nRemarkably, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), chair of the Oversight Committee, didn't have any follow-up questions regarding the question of a bullet or shrapnel.\n\nIt might not matter much, in the grand scheme of things, whether Trump was hit by a bullet or shrapnel -- whatever caused his injuries, an attempt on his life did occur. However, Trump has played up the incident in speeches since it happened, claiming that he was only saved \"by the grace of almighty God\" -- a blatant attempt to appeal to the Christian nationalist sentiment that runs rampant among his far right base.\n\nThe matter could likely be cleared up if Trump submitted his medical records to the FBI. However, Trump has not made any of his records available, much less offered them to the public, in spite of other presidents (such as Ronald Reagan) giving regular updates about their health after their lives had been put at risk.\n\nIndeed, on the days after the shooting, President Joe Biden received a COVID-19 diagnosis. On nearly every day since that diagnosis was made, the White House gave updates on his status.\n\nThe only statement released regarding Trump's health in the days since the shooting was from Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), who served as Trump's White House doctor when he was president. Jackson claimed that he was worried about Trump and traveled to see him after the shooting so he could \"personally check on him.\"\n\n\"Former President Trump is doing well, and he is recovering as expected from the gunshot wound,\" Jackson said.\n\nBut his statement was not an official medical assessment, and didn't include details about Trump's injuries or how he was recovering from them.\n\nTrump has a history of trying to keep details of his health hidden, including by exaggerating or flat-out lying about his supposed wellbeing.\n\nIn 2015, for example, in the run-up to his first serious presidential run, Trump's physician, Harold Bornstein, an internal medicine and gastroenterology specialist, wrote in a note shared with the media that Trump \"has had no significant medical problems\" and that, \"if elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n\nThe wording of that statement was rightly questioned, and years later Bornstein, who is now deceased, admitted that he hadn't actually written the note.\n\n\"[Trump] dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along,\" Bornstein said.\n\nJackson, too, has released dubious health assessments about Trump while he was his White House physician -- including once stating that he believed Trump \"might live to be 200 years old\" if he had a healthier diet.", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_walker@truthout.org", "name": "Chris Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shrapnel shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Wray suggested in congressional testimony that the wound may have been caused by shrapnel, while Trump's former White House physician has said it was caused by a bullet.\n\nTrump's team has remained tight-lipped about it, refraining from publicly sharing the former President's medical records or conducting a press briefing at the Pennsylvania hospital where he was treated. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHere's what we know about Trump's ear wound.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Wray provided new details about the investigation into the assassination attempt and revealed that the agency is not certain the wound was caused by a bullet.\n\n\"There's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear,\" he said.\n\nRead More: America's Political Violence Crisis\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting in Butler, Pa., Trump was treated at Butler Memorial Hospital, but his team did not share details of his wound or care. Doctors at the hospital were not made available for a press conference or questions, and Trump has not released his medical records from the treatment.\n\nOn July 20, a week after the shooting, Trump shared a signed letter from former White House physician Ronny Jackson, now a Republican congressman from Texas, who released new details about the injury and claimed that the wound was caused by a gunshot wound.\n\nIn the letter, Jackson said Trump had a 2 cm-wide gunshot wound in the right ear from a high-powered rifle. \"There was initially significant bleeding, followed by marked swelling of the entire upper ear,\" Jackson wrote. \"The swelling has since resolved, and the wound is beginning to granulate and heal properly. Based on the highly vascular nature of the ear, there is still intermittent bleeding requiring a dressing to be in place. Given the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required.\"\n\nHe said that Trump received a thorough evaluation -- including a CT scan -- at Butler Memorial Hospital, and will undergo further evaluations, including a hearing test.\n\nJackson slammed Wray on X after Wray's testimony, saying it was \"absolutely irresponsible\" for Wray to suggest the injury may have been caused by shrapnel. \"IT WAS A BULLET -- I'VE SEEN THE WOUND!\" Jackson wrote. \"PATHETIC!!!\n\nJackson is a Trump ally and has come under fire in recent years after a Pentagon inspector general's report revealed allegations that Jackson had engaged in \"inappropriate conduct\" as White House physician.\n\nTrump has made some comments about his experience. In a speech at the Republican convention on July 18, Trump, the Republican nominee, said that a bullet \"came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life.\"\n\n\"I said to myself, wow, what was that, it can only be a bullet, and moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down,\" he said. \"The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight.\"\n\nIn a social media post after the rally on July 13, Trump wrote, \"I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.\"\n\nIn a private phone call with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that was posted online, Trump said that in the moment, the object whizzing past him at the rally felt like \"the world's largest mosquito.\"\n\nEric Trump, the former President's son, told CBS News that his father has referred to the injury as \"the greatest earache he's ever had,\" but that he did not require stitches and that his hearing is fine.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simmone_shah@time.com", "name": "Simmone Shah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_to_the_President", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physician to the President"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, ripped Wray in a statement on X: \"What little credibility he may have left is gone after recklessly suggesting Trump might not have been hit from a bullet. It was a bullet -- I've seen the wound. Pathetic!!!\"\n\nJackson said in a July 20 letter released by the Trump campaign that he'd evaluated and treated Trump's wound \"daily\" since the shooting.\n\n\"As reported and witnessed by the entire world, he sustained a gunshot wound to the right ear from a high-powered rifle used by the would-be assassin,\" Jackson said in the letter. \"The bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear,\" adding that there \"was initially significant bleeding,\" but given \"the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required.\"\n\nHouse Speak Mike Johnson said he didn't find Wray's testimony credible: \"We've all seen the video, we've seen the analysis, we've heard it from multiple sources in different angles that a bullet went through his ear.\"\n\nJohnson also said Wray \"was not forthcoming with some of the information that we would expect.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of frustration and concern about the leadership with these agencies,\" Johnson said, apparently referring to the Secret Service as well.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung also blasted Wray, saying: \"Anyone who believes this conspiracy bulls -- is either mentally deficient or willfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons.\"\n\nMeanwhile, new details of the Secret Service's unmistakable failure in securing the Butler site were revealed on Thursday.\n\nAn anonymous whistleblower told Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley that the Secret Service declined an offer from local law enforcement to use drone technology at the rally.\n\nThe whistleblower said a local law enforcement partner made the drone offers to the Secret Service the night before the rally, according to Hawley. The whistleblower said that after the shooting occurred, the Secret Service \"changed course\" and asked local police to use drone technology to surveil the scene, Hawley wrote.\n\nWray confirmed on Wednesday that would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, flew a drone over the rally site about two hours before he carried out the shooting.\n\nWray said the FBI reverse-engineered the drone's flight path and found that Crooks flew it around roughly 200 yards from the stage where Trump later spoke and livestreamed the site for about 11 minutes.\n\n\"This raises an obvious question: why was the U.S. Secret Service not using its own drones?\" Hawley wrote.\n\nThe Missouri lawmaker said it was \"hard to understand\" why the Secret Service did not stop Crooks from using a drone so close to the rally start time while also refusing an offer from local police to employ a drone to help secure the event.\n\nTrump expressed outrage Wednesday over another part of Wray's testimony: His statement that he had not noticed any cognitive decline in his dealings with Joe Biden.\n\n\"Anybody can see that Joe Biden is cognitively and physically challenged, and if you can't see that, you sure as hell can't be running the FBI,\" Trump wrote in a post on social media, adding that \"Wray has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!\"\n\nRelated: Trump again asks on behalf of world: 'Who is running the country? . . .

Pathetic!!! he wrote in the message, with the last two sentences in all caps.\n\nJackson said in the July 20 letter released by the campaign that he had assessed and treated Trump's injury daily since the shooting.\n\nAs has been reported and witnessed by the whole world, he was shot in the right ear by a high-caliber rifle used by the future assassin, Jackson said in the letter.\n\nThe bullet wound produced a 2cm wide wound that extended to the cartilaginous surface of the ear, the letter said, adding that there was initially significant bleeding, but given the large and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were necessary.\n\nRep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., called Wray's testimony remarkable and said Trump owed it to the American people to be honest and say exactly what happened.\n\n\"We have not seen any medical records. No independent physician, other than an ultra-partisan elected member of Congress, has commented on what happened,\" Goldman said.\n\nTrump expressed outrage Wednesday over another part of Wrays' testimony: his claim that he had noticed no cognitive decline in his dealings with President Joe Biden.\n\nEveryone can see that Joe Biden is cognitively and physically disabled, and if you can't see that, you certainly can't run the FBI, Trump wrote in a social media post, adding that Wray must resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!\n\nRyan Nobles\n\nRyan Nobles is a correspondent covering

So it's not surprising they are doing this now,\" he added.\n\nWray's comments contradict Trump's account of the near-fatal event, which he described as a \"very surreal experience\" that was \"supposed\" to end his life.\n\n\"The doctor at the hospital said he never saw anything like this, he called it a miracle,\" Trump told The Post in an interview a day after the shooting at his campaign rally in Butler, Pa.\n\n\"I'm not supposed to be here, I'm supposed to be dead.\"\n\nTrump also recalled being quickly escorted away from the chaotic scene by Secret Service agents despite his desire to continue speaking.\n\n\"I just wanted to keep speaking, but I just got shot,\" he said.\n\nCrooks was killed by Secret Service snipers moments after he fired the eight rounds into the crowd.\n\nTrump, 78, also criticized Wray on Truth Social Wednesday, accusing the FBI director, whom he appointed in 2017, of downplaying concerns about President Biden's apparent cognitive decline.\n\n\"I watched the Congressional Hearing today as Christopher Wray was asked the question whether or not he noticed any Cognitive Degeneration in his many conversations with Crooked Joe Biden,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"[D]espite the fact that Special Counsel Robert Hur said, effectively, that Joe Biden is INCOMPETENT, with LITTLE MEMORY, etc., Wray said that 'it is not something I observed during my interactions with him, which were uneventful and unremarkable,' essentially stating that he found nothing wrong, mentally or physically, with 'Joe,'\" the former president continued.\n\n\"If that is the case, Director Wray should resign immediately from the FBI,\" Trump demanded.\n\nTrump argued that \"anybody can see that Joe Biden is cognitively and physically challenged, and if you can't see that, you sure as hell can't be running the FBI.\"\n\nMany Republicans have accused the Biden administration, including Vice President Kamala Harris, of concealing the president's decline from the public.\n\nBiden, 81, announced on Sunday that he was ending his re-election campaign amid growing calls for him to withdraw due to health concerns.\n\nNevertheless, he vowed to stay in office until the end of his term.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Ronny Jackson (R-TX) -- who served as the appointed Physician to the President under both former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump -- released a full statement describing Trump's gunshot injury and recovery process, the conspiracy theories began to circulate again.\n\nNBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Ryan Nobles pointed to testimony given by FBI director Christopher Wray in a Wednesday hearing, posting, \"This got lost yesterday ... but FBI Director Wray told Congress: 'I think with respect to former President Trump there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that you know hit his ear.' Trump has not released medical records from after the shooting.\"\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem added, \"I've waited a while to say this but the burden is now on Trump to show he was shot. I can condemn the assassination and still demand truth, especially since Trump is now politicizing taking a bullet. Wray has now opened the door; this is not a conspiracy theory. Wray, known for exact phrasing and being careful, didn't say this on accident. He is begging us to ask.\"\n\n\"That's not how that works. You've made the claim. It's your responsibility to prove said claim,\" one responded.\n\nNewsbusters' Alex Christy responded to Kayyem, saying, \"On CNN, you're no longer allowed to call Harris the border czar, but you are allowed to tweet this.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nJackson took to X to fire back, saying, \"ABSOLUTELY IRRESPONSIBLE for Chris Wray to make such a statement as Director of the FBI. Another POLITICALLY MOTIVATED move by the man that has repeatedly weaponized his office to tear down President Trump. What little credibility he may have left is GONE after recklessly suggesting Trump might not have been hit from a bullet. IT WAS A BULLET -- I'VE SEEN THE WOUND!

Several members of law enforcement who were standing near him were hit with debris.\n\n\"Donald Trump was reportedly hit by glass shards, not a bullet, after a shooting occurred at scheduled rally in Pennsylvania. According to law enforcement, a bullet hit a teleprompter and Trump was grazed by glass shards,\" the New Pittsburgh Courier reported the day following the shooting.\n\nEarly briefings caused confusion that Wray's testimony does not clarify at this point. Snopes claimed that Trump was definitively hit with a bullet before Wray's testimony.\n\nTrump's ear appeared to be grazed with an object, but as the FBI Director made apparent, it's unclear what that object was. Trump has claimed he was shot in the ear and wore a large, conspicuous white bandage over his ear at the Republican Convention, which was copied by attendees sporting large white covers to their ears.\n\nNo licensed and/or treating medical personnel have confirmed he was shot as he stated. However, Butler County (a red, rural district in western Pennsylvania) district attorney Richard Goldinger told a reporter that Trump was grazed by gunfire.\n\nOne audience member was killed and two others were seriously injured. The FBI is still trying to determine the motive of the shooter.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do not know the motive. That is obviously one of the central questions in our investigation, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been very frustrating to us that a lot of the usual kind of low-hanging-fruit places that we would find that have not yielded significant clues about his motive,\u00e2\u20ac Wray said.\n\nRepublicans have accused the Secret Service of being derelict in their duty to protect a presidential candidate. However, the Secret Service deleted text messages requested by a watchdog dated January 5th and 6th in the aftermath of the Trump-incited deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021. They denied deleting the messages intentionally.\n\nThe shooters' motive is still unclear. Profiles on him diverge, some saying he was bullied and shy, while others say he was a conservative who enjoyed taking the conservative side of the argument in class and whose friends wore Trump hats.\u00c2 He was a registered Republican, but this fact did not stop Republican lawmakers from blaming Democrats for the shooting. He was wearing a T-shirt advertising The Demolition Ranch, a YouTube channel for gun enthusiasts.\n\nA Philadelphia Inquirer profile quoted a classmate, Max R. Smith, recalling Tom Crooks making political statements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He definitely was conservative. It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nPolitical violence began rising in 2016, \"around the time of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first run for the presidency,\"\u00c2 Gary LaFree, a University of Maryland criminologist who has tracked such violence in a terrorism database between 1970 and 2020, told Reuters.\n\nA majority of Democratic lawmakers and President Biden have repeatedly pushed to ban assault weapons. 220 Republican House members and 49 Senators have consistently blocked gun safety. A common theme in Republican candidates' ads is to pose with an assault weapon, sometimes even around a Christmas tree with their kids holding assault weapons.\n\nNo matter what hit Trump was hit, it occurred during an assassination attempt, which is unacceptable in a free country. While the venue chosen by the Trump campaign provided obvious logistical challenges for the Secret Service and local law enforcement, witness accounts of seeing the shooter on the roof before he shot into the crowd are chilling and speak to a security failure that wrought tragedy for one rally goer's family and put two other people in serious condition.", "source": {"uri": "politicususa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICUSUSA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_jones@politicususa.com", "name": "Sarah Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Still, it did contain some head-scratching moments, like when Wray recycled a Trump assassination conspiracy theory.\n\nThe former president was nearly killed by Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, who was able to scale the rooftop of the nearby American Glass Research building in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, unmolested by authorities, and fire off rounds at Trump. One person, Corey Comperatore, was killed in the crossfire. Two others were injured. The rooftop, less than 200 yards away with a clear line of sight to the stage, was left unprotected, a glaring security flaw that has been the predominant question for the Secret Service.\n\nSome of the most unhinged and virulently anti-Trump sects of the Left have been peddling this theory that Trump either staged this event for political gain or he was never shot -- the latter being a piece of glass from the teleprompter struck him via ricochet. Photo evidence refutes the 'it was just glass' theory, but Wray said Wednesday to members of the House Judiciary Committee that it's indeterminable if Trump was shot or not.\n\nAnd guess what? Newsweek ran with it:\n\nThe FBI is investigating the July 13 shooting, which killed one rally-goer and seriously injured two others before the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by the Secret Service.\n\nTrump was rushed off stage with a bloodied ear. He said that night that he was \"shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.\" He said he heard \"a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin\" in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nA week after the shooting, the Trump campaign released a doctor's note from Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson -- who had served as Trump's White House physician -- that said Trump sustained a gunshot wound to his right ear that was \"less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear.\" Trump is \"doing well, and he is recovering as expected,\" Jackson said.\n\nLater in the hearing, Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee chairman, asked Wray if all eight bullets fired by the gunman had been accounted for.\n\n\"We obviously know that Mr. Comperatore lost his life...two other rally goers were injured, seriously injured, and then the one that hit President Trump. Does that account for...were some of these individuals hit multiple times?\" Jordan asked. \"Where did all eight bullets go, is I guess my question.\"\n\n\"So it's conceivable, as I sit here right now, I don't know whether that bullet in addition to, you know, causing the grazing, could have also landed somewhere else. But I believe we've accounted for all of the shots in the cartridges.\"\n\nWe know nothing about the shooter other than he searched for porn and some things about JFK before attempting this assassination attempt, nothing on the weapon other than it had a collapsible stock, and we don't know how many casings were recovered on the roof. Before she resigned on Tuesday, Cheatle told members of House Oversight she couldn't confirm that Crooks was a lone gunman.\n\nAnd right now, we have the FBI director further mucking up the waters with this 'gee, I don't know if Trump was shot' nonsense. Don't trust the doctor who examined him, but hang on every word a non-medical professional with a history of leading an agency that's protected Democrats says about this assassination attempt.\n\nIs anyone else tired of the 'we don't know' nonsense from the FBI?

There was one puzzling exchange he had with Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH), however, that turned heads and earned a strong condemnation from Donald Trump.\n\nDespite the fact that eight shots ran out on July 13 during a Pennsylvania campaign rally, despite retired fire chief Corey Comperatore being killed by gunfire and two others injured, and despite the fact that the GOP nominee's doctor who actually treated the wound described it as a gunshot injury, Wray wasn't convinced.\n\nResponding to a question from Jordan, Wray said:\n\n\"With respect to former President Trump, there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear.\"\n\nWatch:\n\nI'm unclear why there's \"some question\" when the former president's physician said quite clearly said Trump \"sustained a gunshot wound to the right ear\":\n\nThe author of the above letter, Dr. Ronny Jackson, noted that the bullet came less than a quarter inch from entering the former president's head.\n\n\"As reported and witnessed by the entire world, he sustained a gunshot wound to the right ear from a high-powered rifle used by the would-be assassin,\" former White House physician and current Congressman Ronny Jackson said in a statement on Saturday, a week after the shooting.\n\n\"The bullet track produced a 2 cm wide wound that extended down to the cartilaginous surface of the ear,\" wrote [Rep] Jackson, (R-Texas), noting he examined Trump the night he was shot.\n\n\"There was initially significant bleeding, followed by marked swelling of the entire upper ear.\"\n\nRelated: Surprise: Not All of FBI Director Christopher Wray's Testimony on Wednesday Was Forthright\n\nRevelations: What Did We Learn About the Assassination Attempt From Christopher Wray's Testimony?\n\nTrump himself was not amused and lit into Wray:\n\n\"Anyone who believes this conspiracy bulls-t is either mentally deficient or willfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons,\" Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung told The Post.\n\n\"We have seen there is no depth low enough for the Biden-Harris Administration. So it's not surprising they are doing this now,\" he added.\n\nTrump was also disgusted by what he considers Wray's gaslighting of the public regarding Joe Biden's mental deterioration. He called for the director's resignation, writing, \"WRAY has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!\"\n\nIt's unclear why Wray would so irresponsibly question Jackson's medical determination. Unless he has some new information that he is willing to share publicly, casting doubt will just fuel conspiracy theories and rile up the leftist tinfoil hat crowd.

They should be ashamed of themselves!!!\"\n\nNBC News's Ryan Nobles weighed in on Wray's remarks, which he quoted, \"I think with respect to former President Trump there's some question about whether or not it's a bullet or shrapnel that you know hit his ear.\" Noble then noted, \"Trump has not released medical records from after the shooting.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The Daily Wire host slammed those questioning if Trump was actually hit by a bullet and said the American people are concerned about why Trump wasn't given proper security from the Secret Service, not about a \"mythical shard.\"\n\nKnowles said he doesn't \"stay up at night wondering the answer to the questions of this mythical shard or any other ways that the Democrats are trying to downplay the very near, within a hair's breadth, assassination of Donald Trump.\"\n\nHe added that the bigger question is why wasn't the former president held back from taking the stage when the would-be assassin was spotted by Secret Service snipers 20 minutes before Trump walked out for his speech.\n\n\"I'm just a regular Joe. When I go to a speaking event, they'll sometimes hold me back. I'm not the President of the United States, so that needs answered,\" Knowles said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said that the snipers spotted the shooter on the roof of the American Glass Research Building at 5:52 p.m., minutes before Trump took the stage. The shooter fired at Trump at 6:12 p.m. Wray also revealed on Wednesday that the FBI believes the gunman flew a drone over the rally venue just a few hours before the assassination attempt.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\n\"The real questions are: why was Donald Trump not given sufficient security resources? Why did the Secret Service lie about the requests from the Trump campaign to get sufficient security resources? And how far up does this go?\" he continued. \"Sure, both parties now want to fire the Secret Service director, and she resigned, finally, under duress. But what about her boss, Alejandro Mayorkas, the DHS secretary? What about his boss, Joe Biden? How on Earth does the most threatened man on planet Earth, Donald Trump, even need to ask for additional security and how on Earth could it be denied?\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Wire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

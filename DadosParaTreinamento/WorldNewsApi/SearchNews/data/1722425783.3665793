Aydin accused Cabral of speaking poorly about her glam team member, while Cabral insisted she was only giving Aydin a heads-up that payment wasn\u2019t likely should she choose to participate in a shoot for the stylist\u2019s hair extension business. Cabral called Aydin \u201cdirty,\u201d prompting the \u201cNew Jersey\u201d vet to shove her counterpart. In retaliation, Cabral threw her drink on Aydin, even slamming her plastic cup against the latter\u2019s face. \u201cDanielle was in my space like that the year before,\u201d Josephs, who didn\u2019t get along with Cabral in Season 13 before growing close over the past year, pointed out to Page Six. \u201cI didn\u2019t push her like that. That did not happen between myself and Danielle.\u201d Fuda, 33 \u2014 who, like Josephs, did not attend the cast event \u2014 told us that she doesn\u2019t blame Cabral for her reaction. \u201cDanielle did what anyone in this group would do. If someone shoved you with such force, you\u2019re cracked in the head,\u201d she said. The Bravolebrity said she wasn\u2019t shocked by Aydin\u2019s behavior when watching the scene as it aligns with what she perceives to be an \u201cantagonist\u201d persona. \u201cBased on Jennifer Aydin\u2019s track record of aggression and lack of boundaries, what I heard and what I saw were really the same thing. That\u2019s my expectation for Jen,\u201d Fuda explained. \u201cShe likes to be the antagonist. She likes to push people\u2019s buttons. She knows how to push them and see how far she can literally push them.\u201d As Page Six reported last September, Aydin and Cabral engaged in an explosive confrontation during production that resulted in both parties being temporarily suspended from filming. All these months later, both Josephs and Fuda \u2014 who each remain tight with Cabral \u2014 are happy to let the drama live in the past and celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community this Pride Month. \u201cI\u2019m queen of supporting Pride. I love it. It\u2019s such an important month to support the LGBTQ+ community. I\u2019ve always been doing that for years,\u201d Josephs said of why she came out to support the event, co-hosted by Cohen, 36, and \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star Erin Lichy, co-founder of Mezcalum. \u201cPride\u2019s about celebration and we\u2019re here to do that. We\u2019re here to celebrate Erin, who\u2019s such a beautiful [ally to] the community.\u201d Fuda was equally thrilled to put her passion for Pride on display. \u201cThis event tonight just represents so much unity and love that we\u2019re missing in our community and I think it just represents what we should be celebrating every day \u2014 just the love, looking past differences and accepting people for who they are,\u201d she told Page Six. \u201cIf you have this platform and you don\u2019t use it for positive things, then what\u2019s the point? There has to be more than the toxicity.\u201d Party attendees \u2014 also including \u201cReal Housewives of Salt Lake City\u201d star Meredith Marks, \u201cThe McBee Dynasty\u201d star Galyna Saltkovska, entrepreneur Lexi Barbuto and content creator Donald \u201cPrima Donald\u201d Adler \u2014 enjoyed mezcal cocktails made with Lichy\u2019s Mezcalum. Meanwhile, Cohen debuted his new single \u201cTouch Me.\u201d \u201cThe Real Housewives of New Jersey\u201d airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "summary": "\"The truth is Jennifer really pushed her much harder than I ever thought and really was the aggressor in that situation,\" Josephs exclusively told Page Six.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/06/28/entertainment/margaret-josephs-rachel-fuda-defend-danielle-cabral-against-jennifer-aydin-after-rhonj-fight/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/84636845.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/upAaa0IR-guILbWnz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:04:27", "author": "Caroline Blair,Evan Real", "authors": ["Caroline Blair", "Evan Real"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.162}

Sens. Steve Santarsiero, D-Doylestown, and Kristin Phillips-Hill, R-Jacobus, said they\u2019ll soon introduce legislation to \u201cuphold Pennsylvania\u2019s steadfast support for Israel\u201d by banning from state Treasury or pension funds from divesting from the nation and companies that do business with it. Santarsiero emphasized Israel\u2019s role as a commercial trading partner, historical ally, and \u201cthe only true democracy in a volatile region of the world.\u201d \u201cTo that end, we must act to prevent our commonwealth, including our colleges and universities, from taking the wholly unwarranted action of divesting from Israel,\u201d he said Friday in a joint statement with Phillips-Hill. \u201cLike America, Israel will not be bullied by detractors,\u201d Phillips-Hill added, calling on all policymakers to act. \u201cA strong and prosperous Israel needs a strong partner in the United States.\u201d Elected officials, including Gov. Josh Shapiro and Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, have been emphatic in their support for the embattled nation as its bombing campaign in Gaza \u2013 triggered by a Hamas-led assault on Oct. 7 that left 1,200 Israelis dead and more than 200 taken hostage \u2013 stretches into a seventh month. Israel\u2019s bombings in the region have killed nearly 35,000 Palestinians, injured more than 78,000 and displaced 1.7 million, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The violence spawned protests across the nation, including one at the University of Pennsylvania, where demonstrators demanded the state boycott Israeli financial holdings. University officials eventually disbanded the encampment, with Shapiro\u2019s backing, and pointed to state law that prevents publicly funded institutions from divesting. Treasurer Stacy Garrity expressed support for the bill on Friday, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d that other state funds should be prohibited from divesting. In the weeks after the Hamas attack, she upped Israeli bonds by nearly half. \u201cI also agree with the senators that no university or college which divests from Israel should receive state funding,\u201d she told The Center Square. \u201cI urge the General Assembly to get this bill done quickly.\u201d", "summary": "(The Center Square) \u2013 Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to protect the state\u2019s Israeli financial holdings despite mounting public pressure to cut ties amid the ongoing war with Hamas.

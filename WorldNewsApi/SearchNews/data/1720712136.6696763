He is believed to have set off on a popular coasting walking route towards the small village of Pedi. The stroll is estimated to take around 15 minutes, with the route previously being described as a \"clear path\". The TV doctor had not returned to the accommodation where he was staying with his wife by 3pm. When she arrived back to the property, she found his phone in the same position he had left it in before he headed out. Dr Bailey alerted the police that he was missing at around 7.30pm and the rescue operation was subsequently launched. During that day, Dr Mosley was captured on CCTV at the St Nikolas beach restaurant. Grini Kaurmadia, whose family own the establishment, said Dr Mosley used the bathroom at around 1pm on Wednesday. She said: \"We can see him go into the bathroom and then leave, we don\u2019t know where he went next. We don\u2019t know how he got here, some people catch the water taxi from Symi. They didn\u2019t eat here so we don\u2019t know how long they were at the beach. We did not speak with him.\" Thursday, June 6: Locals spread the word over missing doc as mayor shares doubts that Michael is still in the area Symi Facebook groups began receiving posts asking for local members to keep an eye out for Dr Mosley. The group \"Friends of Symi\" appealed for witnesses and described the health expert as a \"familiar face for many British people\". By the afternoon, firefighters and the coastguard joined forces with the police leading the search operation. The task force also employed a team of dogs, helicopters, and a thermal imaging drone to scour the area around Pedi. In the evening, the Mayor of Symi said it was \"impossible\" that Dr Mosley is still in the area. He said: \"It is a very small, controlled area, full of people. So, if something happened to him there, we would have found him by now.\" Friday, June 7: Extreme weather warnings as divers and patrol boats join in search On Friday, more weather warning were issued as forecasters stressed that temperatures could reach up to 48C. The search on Friday commenced at 9am, with divers later searching the waters from the afternoon. Symi\u2019s coast guard said: \u201cAll our patrol boats are searching \u2026 about five and also all the private boats, commercial boats know about the incident and they look for (him) also, in this area, (so this is) the private, the commercial and the patrol (boats looking).\u201d A spokesperson for the Greek fire service confirmed that Greek police are using sniffer dogs in the search. Later that day, the first set of CCTV images were released of the doctor walking in Pedi under an umbrella near Blue Corner cafe. Saturday, June 8: Search resumes with firefighters forced to split up and snake warning issued 6am: This morning, a search co-ordinator confirmed that the search had resumed at around 6am. Firefighters began to examine a 6.5k radius over a mountainous area that is surrounded by sea. Manolis Tsimpoukas, who arranges searches for missing people on the Dodecanese Islands, said there had been no sign of Dr Mosley. He described the area as \"very dangerous\" and said if anything was discovered then they would locate the doctor within an hour. Shortly before 8am: Symi\u2019s mayor Eleftherios Papakaloudoukas said there is \"no chance\" the search will be called off until he is found. The long-standing mayor described the area where Dr Mosley is believed to have travelled through is \u201cdifficult to pass\u201d and is \u201conly rocks\u201d. He sparked further concerns when he said the area is populated by \"loads\" of snakes. 10.34am: Firefighters released a drone as they hiked up a mountainous area. There is no path or shade near the top of the hill that sits between Pedi bay and Agia Marina, where they suspect he may have walked. It comes after an extreme heat warning was launched in the area. Shortly before 11am: Individual firefighters were forced to split up as they covered vast expanses of steep rocky terrain on their own. One uniformed worker said there were 10 of them searching multiple summits because it was too dangerous for large crews to work during the summer months. Firefighter Stergos Giakoumakis said: \u201cBecause it\u2019s not so easy to bring here 100 people, especially this period, because it\u2019s the most dangerous period. Everything is dry and it is too dangerous for firemen to search.\u201d", "summary": "Health guru Michael Mosley, known for popularising the 5:2 diet, has been found dead in a rocky area of the Greek island of Symi after the TV star disappeared on a walk", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/michael-mosley-cause-death-everything-32992110", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32992194.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Lorraine-TV-show-London-UK-15-Mar-2024.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:20:37", "author": "Saffron Otter,Saffronotter Mirror", "authors": ["Saffron Otter", "Saffronotter Mirror"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.168}

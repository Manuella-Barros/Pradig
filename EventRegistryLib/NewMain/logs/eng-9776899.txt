The meeting was attended by Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar, advisor to the J&K government, chief secretary Atal Dulloo and principal secretary to LG, Mandeep K Bhandari.\n\nThe decision ends an over seven decade long \"discrimination\" with the \"displaced persons from West Pakistan'' as they too have been granted proprietary rights on state land as has been the case with people displaced from areas of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), officials said, adding that it shall empower thousands of WPR families settled across the Jammu region.\n\nThese families, who were considered \"non-state subject\" and had no right to cast vote in the Legislative Assembly elections in the erstwhile J&K state, were conferred domicile status by the Government of India in the wake of the August 5, 2019 abrogation of Article 370.\n\n\"The decision fulfils demands of all connected families, which have been requesting for ownership rights for past so many decades. Vesting of proprietary right to West Pakistan Displaced Persons on state land would bring them at par with the Displaced Persons of POJK (Pakistan occupied J&K) and their long pending demand will also be fulfilled,'' an official spokesperson said.\n\nThe Administrative Council also approved conferment of proprietary rights upon the Displaced Persons of 1965 in respect of state land. The spokesperson said that the government has always remained committed to provide benefits to the Displaced Persons of 1965 like it has granted to the Displaced Persons of 1947 and 1971, adding that the Revenue Department shall ensure that proper safeguards are built in the operational guidelines to prevent any misuse, such as any unauthorised encroachments on the state land.\n\nA total of 5,764 families, according to official records, had come to Jammu and Kashmir from areas of West Pakistan during the 1947 partition. They were then allotted 4 acres agricultural land per family and settled in the districts of Jammu, Samba and Kathua. Their numbers, at present, has swelled over to 22,170 families.\n\nGandhi who hailed the decision, however, said that only 50 per cent of this land was state land and the remaining was \"evacuee land\" as the same belonged to local Muslim residents of J&K who had migrated to Pakistan in the wake of 1947 Partition. The administration would also clear its stand on the evacuee land, which has been under the possession of the WPRs, he added.\n\nEarlier, the Centre had on June 13, 2018 implemented a scheme for providing one-time financial assistance of Rs 5.5. lakh per family to 5,764 WPR families. With a total outlay of Rs 317.02 crore, the government had fixed March 31, 2021 as timeline for covering these families.\n\nHowever, due to non-receipt of authenticated proposals from the then J&K government, there was no disbursement of financial assistance during the years 2018-19 and 2019-20, making the Central government to extend the scheme up to March 31, 2024.\n\nAccording to Labha Ram Gandhi, of the 5,764 WPRs registered in 1947, only 1,890 families have been provided financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh each so far. He said that he recently met the Union minister in the PMO, Dr Jitendra Singh, to urge him to expedite the disbursement of financial assistance among the remaining families.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arun_sharma@indianexpress.com", "name": "Arun Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jammu division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._R._Bhatnagar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R.

The West Pakistan Refugees (WPRs) have been granted ownership rights of land in the Union Territory, where they were settled after the 1947 Partition.\n\nThe decision was taken at the Administrative Council meeting chaired by Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor (LG) Manoj Sinha on Tuesday (July 30). This will reportedly benefit thousands of refugee families from Pakistan.\n\nBut why have they been granted land ownership rights? Let's understand.\n\nWhen displaced persons from Pakistan came to India\n\nDuring the Partition in 1947, as many as 5,764 families arrived in Jammu and Kashmir from West Pakistan, according to official records.\n\nThese refugees comprised 80 per cent from Scheduled Castes (SCs), 10 per cent from Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and 10 per cent from the General Category, reported Outlook.\n\nEvery refugee family was allocated four acres of agricultural land, while they were settled in the districts of Jammu, Samba and Kathua, as per an Indian Express report. The number of these families currently stands at over 22,170.\n\nSoon after the Partition, Pakistan launched 'Operation Gulmarg', mobilising tribals from North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) who raided the then princely state of J&K.\n\nThousands died in the violence and over 47,000 people from Pakistani towns near Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) were forced to flee, as per The Hindu report.\n\nThose who escaped from PoK were called \"displaced persons from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\" In 2016, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) replaced the term with 'Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir', or PoJK, in official documents.\n\nOfficial data shows that 31,779 such families migrated from PoJK in 1947. Many other families were displaced during the Indo-Pak wars of 1965 and 1971, increasing the tally to 41,844, as per The Hindu.\n\nThe J&K administration has granted proprietary rights on state land to West Pakistan refugees in the UT. The Administrative Council has also given a nod to confer proprietary rights of state land upon the Displaced Persons of 1965.\n\nAccording to officials, this will end the \"discrimination\" with the \"displaced persons from West Pakistan'', bringing them at par with people displaced from PoK, Indian Express reported.\n\n\"This will end the discrimination with the WPRs and Displaced Persons of 1965 war and will significantly empower thousands of families across the Jammu region,\" an official spokesman was quoted as saying by The New Indian Express (TNIE).\n\nAfter the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, the West Pakistan refugees in J&K were accorded domicile status by the Central government. Before the repeal, they were considered a \"non-state subject\" and did not have the right to elect representatives to the J&K Legislative Assembly.\n\nA total of 46,666 kanals (5,833 acres) of land was allotted to WPRs by the state government in May 1954. \"While the land was allocated to us, we were not given legal ownership. We were treated as outsiders, unable to sell the land since it was not in our names,\" Labha Ram Gandhi told Outlook last year.\n\nSpeaking to Indian Express, Gandhi has lauded the J&K administration's decision to grant land ownership rights to West Pakistan refugees. However, he mentioned that only 50 per cent of this land was state land, while the rest was \"evacuee land\" that belonged to Muslim residents of J&K who had migrated to Pakistan after the 1947 Partition.\n\nGandhi said the administration would clarify its stance on the evacuee land, where refugee families have settled.\n\nLast May, Lt Governor Sinha had announced in Jammu that ownership rights of lands for WPRs will be ensured on the Centre's order.\n\n\"The decision fulfils demands of all connected families, which have been requesting for ownership rights for past so many decades. Vesting of proprietary right to West Pakistan Displaced Persons on state land would bring them at par with the Displaced Persons of POJK (Pakistan occupied J&K) and their long pending demand will also be fulfilled,'' an official spokesperson said, as per Indian Express.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

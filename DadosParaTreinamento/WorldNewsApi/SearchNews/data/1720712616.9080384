They are twins.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018My husband told me they weren\u2019t twins!\u2019 \" she recounted. \"It was probably a couple of months.

I remember she going, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I love this boat so much,\u2019 and [she] talks about it all the time. [I realized], \u2018Oh, she really wants a boat.\u2019 \" Montez continued, \"So, I planned for it.

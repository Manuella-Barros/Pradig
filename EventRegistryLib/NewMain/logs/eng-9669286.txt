The manager known for his passive approach, faced severe backlash as England failed to capitalise on their early lead against Denmark.\n\nAfter Harry Kane scored the opener, England adopted a defensive stance, inviting pressure from the Danish side. This strategy ultimately backfired, allowing Denmark to equalise.\n\nFans expressed frustration at Southgate's deployment of talented players in unfamiliar positions.

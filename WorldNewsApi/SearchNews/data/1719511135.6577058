The Church, as a mother, welcomes you and accompanies you with tenderness and hope,\u201d the Pope said to the estimated 50,000 in attendance at Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium on May 25. Recalling his meeting with nearly 7,000 children last November \u2014 an event sponsored by the Dicastery for Culture and Education dedicated to the theme \u201cLet Us Learn from Boys and Girls\u201d \u2014 the Pope explained that the meeting \u201cleft a lasting impression in my heart\u201d and was the catalyst for World Children\u2019s Day. \u201cI prayed and realized that our conversation had to continue and expand to reach more children and young people,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cThat is why we are here today: to keep the dialogue going, to ask questions and seek answers together.\u201d World Children\u2019s Day is a new initiative by Pope Francis sponsored by the Vatican\u2019s Dicastery for Culture and Education in collaboration with the Catholic community of Sant\u2019Egidio, the Auxilium Cooperative, and the Italian Football Federation. The event commenced at Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium, transformed into the \u201cChildren\u2019s Village,\u201d at 3:30 p.m. local time. Italian professional soccer players engaged in a friendly soccer match with some of the children clad in uniforms. Pope Francis arrived at the stadium in the white \u201cpopemobile\u201d at approximately 4:40 p.m. against the backdrop of thunderous cheers from the crowd, who represented more than 100 nationalities. The Pope took a seat in the arena, where he was surrounded by children, where he opened his speech addressing some of the issues children face but encouraged them to have faith. Speaking on the theme of war and peace, the Pope asked the children: \u201cAre you sad about the wars?\u201d To which they answered in unison: \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cYou are saddened because many of your peers cannot go to school. There are girls and boys who cannot go to school. They are realities that I also carry in my heart, and I pray for them,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cWe pray for the children who cannot go to school, for the children who suffer from wars, for the children who have nothing to eat, for the children who are sick and no one cares for them,\u201d he said. But striking an optimistic note, the Pope asked the children if they knew the motto of the event, telling them that it is taken from the Bible: \u201cBehold, I Make All Things New.\u201d \u201cThis is the motto. It\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Pope Francis said. \u201cThink: God wants this; everything that is not new passes away. God is new. The Lord always gives us news.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s move forward and have joy,\u201d the Pope said in his closing remarks. \u201cJoy is health for the soul.\u201d At the end of the address, the Pope asked the attendees to join him in praying the Hail Mary. \u201cLet\u2019s pray to the Mother, to the Mother of Heaven.\u201d Earlier in the morning, Pope Francis met with a group of Palestinian and Ukrainian children at the Vatican. Some of the children had lost their parents, while others lost limbs or had other visible injuries. Vatican news reported that the encounter was organized by Father Marcin Schmidt, who introduced the children and spoke on the struggles they\u2019ve faced. On Sunday morning, the children joined Pope Francis for Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square at 10:30 a.m. Afterward, the Pope delivered the Angelus address at noon from the window of the Apostolic Palace, accompanied by Italian actor Roberto Benigni.", "summary": "cna", "url": "https://www.ncregister.com/cna/pope-francis-meets-with-50-000-for-world-children-s-day-in-rome-s-olympic-stadium", "image": "https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20240525130512_f3365ca2ae88aff56bc80c189439168f908af0d3a2b2180ee4fa5ed39b83fd5d.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:18:13", "author": "Matthew Santucci/cna", "authors": ["Matthew Santucci/cna"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.346}

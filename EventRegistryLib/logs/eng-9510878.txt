Investigations into the cases are ongoing.\n\nNitazenes can last longer in the body than heroin and naloxone. Higher and repeated doses of naloxone and hospital treatment are often required to treat nitazene overdose.\n\nBecause of their strength, nitazenes are more likely to decrease or stop breathing than other opioids, increasing the risk of serious overdoses and death.\n\nNSW Health chief addiction medicine specialist, Dr Hester Wilson, said it was important to recognise the signs of an opioid overdose early and respond quickly. She said in light of the cluster of cases, it was essential for people who used drugs to carry naloxone, and to call an ambulance if they suspected an overdose.\n\n\"Opioids such as heroin can cause pinpoint pupils, drowsiness, loss of consciousness, slowed breathing/snoring and skin turning blue/grey, and can be life-threatening,\" she said.\n\n\"One of the dangers of illicit drug supply is the strength and contents of the substance you are getting is unknown and can be inconsistent.\"\n\nRelated: Experts warn of influx of synthetic opioids amid calls for second Melbourne injecting room\n\nTake-home naloxone is available as a nasal spray or injection from some pharmacies and other health services.\n\nNitazenes have previously been identified in the ACT, NSW, Victoria and South Australia.\n\nHealth experts attending the World Health Summit regional meeting in Melbourne on Monday warned the drugs posed an imminent threat to Australia. The head of Harm Reduction Victoria, Sione Crawford, said it was only a matter of time before \"some kind of disaster\" occurred such as a cluster of deaths.\n\nWhile safe-injecting rooms were among the measures Crawford and other experts called for, a proposed safe injecting room in Melbourne's CBD was rejected by the Victorian government on Tuesday.

ISEA publishes the ANSI/ISEA Z308.1-2021 standard \u00e2\u0080\" which provides minimum performance specifications for occupational first aid kits and the supplies they contain.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of naloxone as an OTC drug gives workplaces access to a lifesaving tool to reduce the number of opioid overdose deaths. Workplaces can help prevent overdose deaths by stocking lifesaving medication on site and equipping employees with proper overdose response training to help save a life.\n\nThis guidance does not appear in the current ANSI/ISEA Z308.1 standard because it was revised before the FDA approved naloxone. While a new update to ANSI/ISEA Z308.1 is planned for 2025, ISEA urges workplaces to add naloxone to their first aid kits now rather than wait for new guidelines.\n\n\"We all have a role to play in addressing the opioid epidemic, including employers,\" said Cam Mackey, president & CEO of ISEA. \"Providing access to naloxone and appropriate training at work can protect workers and possibly save someone's life. We encourage all employers to make this change to their first aid kits now.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 525 people died from overdoses at work in 2022.\n\nIn a March 2024 statement, the White House challenged leaders to increase training and access to opioid overdose reversal medications, keeping the medications in first aid kits, and distributing the medications to employees and customers so they might save a life at home, work, or in their communities.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has a significant impact on the labor market. An estimated 12.6% of the U.S. workforce receives an opioid prescription each year, and 75% of employers surveyed by the National Safety Council (NSC) report that they have been directly affected by opioids. With opioid deaths surging, there's no time to wait before adopting programs to reduce opioid tragedies in the workplace.\n\nSome companies and communities are already combatting opioid overdoses by making naloxone available and committing to more training. For example, the Chicago Department of Aviation added Narcan to 96 automated external defibrillator (AED) cabinets at O'Hare International Airport and 32 at Midway International Airport. Also, state health officials in California have pushed to expand access to the medication, distributing millions of kits for free.\n\nIn opioid overdose emergencies, bystanders are often the first to witness or be in the presence of the person experiencing an overdose.7 Individuals should not be reluctant to come to the aid of others out of fear of potential litigation. According to NSC, 49 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that provide legal protection to individuals who administer naloxone in good faith to someone experiencing an opioid overdose.\n\nDon't wait to take action in the opioid epidemic response. Prepare now for overdose emergencies by stocking naloxone on site and equipping employees with proper overdose response training and resources.

Investigations into the cases are ongoing.\n\nNitazenes can last longer in the body than heroin and naloxone. Higher and repeated doses of naloxone and hospital treatment are often required to treat nitazene overdose.\n\nBecause of their strength, nitazenes are more likely to decrease or stop breathing than other opioids, increasing the risk of serious overdoses and death.\n\nNSW Health chief addiction medicine specialist, Dr Hester Wilson, said it was important to recognise the signs of an opioid overdose early and respond quickly. She said in light of the cluster of cases, it was essential for people who used drugs to carry naloxone, and to call an ambulance if they suspected an overdose.\n\n\"Opioids such as heroin can cause pinpoint pupils, drowsiness, loss of consciousness, slowed breathing/snoring and skin turning blue/grey, and can be life-threatening,\" she said.\n\n\"One of the dangers of illicit drug supply is the strength and contents of the substance you are getting is unknown and can be inconsistent.\"\n\nTake-home naloxone is available as a nasal spray or injection from some pharmacies and other health services.\n\nNitazenes have previously been identified in the ACT, NSW, Victoria and South Australia.\n\nHealth experts attending the World Health Summit regional meeting in Melbourne on Monday warned the drugs posed an imminent threat to Australia. The head of Harm Reduction Victoria, Sione Crawford, said it was only a matter of time before \"some kind of disaster\" occurred such as a cluster of deaths.\n\nWhile safe-injecting rooms were among the measures Crawford and other experts called for, a proposed safe injecting room in Melbourne's CBD was rejected by the Victorian government on Tuesday. Addiction experts have warned the decision will \"cost lives\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

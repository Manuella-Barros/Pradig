Fadnavis expressed confidence that the MahaYuti would sweep the Assembly elections as the \u201clife of the false narratives created by the Maha Vikas Aghadi was over, and it would not work in the Assembly polls\u201d. Fadnavis said it would be possible to retain power after the Assembly elections in Maharashtra by putting up a show of unity and fighting elections with full force and strength. Earlier, the legislators reaffirmed faith and confidence in the leadership of Fadnavis and urged him not to step down but lead the party from within. Fadnavis has dropped his proposal to relieve him from the Deputy CM\u2019s post after meeting Home Minister Amit Shah, who asked him to continue. Speaking at the meeting, Fadnavis said: \u201cI am a fighter and I will not stop till the MahaYuti\u2019s flag is hoisted in the state. I also appeal to you not to stop but work hard for success. I have started work for the party\u2019s victory in the coming Assembly elections a day after the Lok Sabha election results were announced on June 4. I am confident that the BJP, which is ahead in 76 Assembly segments and the MahaYuti in 133 Assembly seats, would be able to achieve a majority.\u201d He, however, asked the party leaders and spokespersons to stop taking potshots against allies. \u201cLet\u2019s stop criticising each other though we (MahaYuti) have our own opinions. A lack of coordination among allies in some seats was noticed, but it has now been taken into account. The BJP\u2019s cooperation helped allies to victory and also, the latter\u2019s contribution led to the victory of party nominees. We sincerely worked for allies,\u201d said Fadnavis. He asked the party spokespersons to air their views in a balanced manner. \u201cThis is not a time to take pot shots against each other. We have to take everybody along. BJP and allies should speak in one language and sing one tune instead of making different narratives against each other. There are complaints, but the leaders need to understand them and address them,\u201d said Fadnavis. \u201cI am a fighter and I will not stop till the MahaYuti\u2019s flag is hoisted in the state. I also appeal to you not to stop but work hard for success. I have started work for the party\u2019s victory in the coming assembly elections a day after the Lok Sabha election results were announced on June 4. I am confident that the BJP, which is ahead in 76 Assembly segments and the MahaYuti in 133 Assembly seats, would be able to achieve a majority.\u201d Fadnavis, however, said that the MVA\u2019s narrative with regard to the change in the Constitution impacted the Dalit and tribal voter base. \u201cThis narrative worked in one election but will not work in the coming Assembly elections,\u201d he said. \u2013IANS sj/pgh", "summary": "<p>Mumbai, June 8 (IANS) Undeterred by the BJP&#8217;s disappointing show in Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra, Deputy Chief Minister and senior party leader Devendra Fadnavis at the legislators&#8217; meeting here&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/mahayuti-will-sweep-assembly-polls-as-mvas-false-narratives-wont-work-again-fadnavis/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">MahaYuti will sweep Assembly polls as MVA&#8217;s false narratives won&#8217;t work again: Fadnavis</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/mahayuti-will-sweep-assembly-polls-as-mvas-false-narratives-wont-work-again-fadnavis/\">MahaYuti will sweep Assembly polls as MVA\u2019s false narratives won\u2019t work again: Fadnavis</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/mahayuti-will-sweep-assembly-polls-as-mvas-false-narratives-wont-work-again-fadnavis/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202406083172414.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:19:11", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": -0.305}

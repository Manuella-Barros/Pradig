Everything we know about Ruby Sunday", "text": "Millie Gibson has impressed on Doctor Who (Picture: Lisa O\u2019Connor/Variety via Getty Images) Millie Gibson left viewers in awe of her acting chops in Doctor Who, but the question is \u2013 will she be sticking around? Playing Ruby Sunday \u2013 the companion to Ncuti Gatwa\u2019s Doctor in the sci-fi series \u2013 Millie has quickly earned the approval of loyal fans. Since making her first appearance in the 2023 Christmas special, we have seen her character come into contact with dinosaurs, space babies and a live battlefield. The former Coronation Street actress was particularly impressive in the fourth horror-esque episode, 73 Yards, which aired on May 25. In the 47-minute programme, Ruby was forced to solve a mystery alone in rural Wales after the Doctor vanished. Millie was able to lead the narrative while her co-star was missing and received plenty of praise for it. Some viewers even described her \u2018powerhouse performance\u2019 as responsible for delivering the \u2018best episode yet\u2019. This is Millie\u2019s first full series of Doctor Who (there are still four more episodes to air), but she has already faced axe speculation. Millie was said to be replaced by Andor star Varada Sethu, with claims showrunner Russell T Davies had already written out her character. Russell explained why he doesn\u2019t respond to rumours (Picture: Aliah Anderson/WireImage) While in conversation with Metro.co.uk, he explained why he never responds to the online rumours, even if they aren\u2019t entirely accurate. \u2018It\u2019s tricky because you can\u2019t answer online rumours. Sometimes they\u2019re lies, sometimes they\u2019re true. Sometimes they\u2019re false, sometimes they\u2019re just exaggerations,\u2019 he stated. \u2018You cannot answer them all \u2013 by the time you\u2019ve answered one rumour, it\u2019s gone and mutated, and actually then you discover you\u2019re actually answering someone in Saskatchewan with 79 followers. It\u2019s what you thought was a rumour was just someone making it up in their shed. So you can\u2019t, you simply can\u2019t.\u2019 Who plays Ruby Sunday in Doctor Who? As we know Millie plays Ruby Sunday, and that won\u2019t be changing any time soon. Ruby is played by Millie (Picture: BBC Studios/James Pardon) It has been confirmed she will be returning for the 15th series, with Ncuti also back. Millie will be joined by Varada, instead of replaced by her. The episodes are set to air in 2025, with some scenes already being filmed, so fans don\u2019t have to worry about Millie disappearing from the cast list any time soon. Millie herself has said she could be on the show until she\u2019s elderly. \u2018I know how it ends next season,\u2019 she told Radio Times. \u2018But after that I can only guess. I might be here with a walking stick in a few decades.\u2019 Ncuti will have two companions (Picture: James Pardon/Bad Wolf/BBC Studios/PA Wire) What is Millie Gibson\u2019s age? Millie is aged 19 but already has a pretty impressive career. Her breakout role came in 2019, playing Kelly Neelan on Coronation Street. Long before she stepped foot in the Tardis, she was walking the cobbles. During her time on the show, she was involved in some hard-hitting storylines, including one that saw her character involved in a hate crime against goths Nina Lucas (Mollie Gallagher) and Seb Franklin, who died as a result of the attack. She left the show in 2022 after three dramatic years. Millie is 19 (Picture: James Pardon/Bad Wolf/BBC Studios) Ncuti has praised his co-star (Picture: James Pardon/Bad Wolf/BBC Studios) When arriving on set for Doctor Who, she impressed Sex Education actor Ncuti, 31, with her acting prowess. \u2018She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor,\u2019 he shared. \u2018From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent.\u2019 On top of Doctor Who, Millie is also set to star in The Forsyte Saga, alongside Eleanor Tomlinson, Francesca Annis, Stephen Moyer, and Jack Devenport. Doctor Who returns with episode five Dot and Bubble on Saturday June 1 on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. Got a story?

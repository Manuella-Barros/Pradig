Chanaaz Mangroe, who performed under the moniker Channii Monroe, said the abuse occurred in 2015.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Mangroe stated in the lawsuit that Gesteelde-Diamant forced her to have sex on multiple occasions, strangled her and recording the two having sexual relations and threatened to share the video with other people.\n\nThe suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, also accused Gesteelde-Diamant of sex trafficking. Mangroe's suit cites the Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, which is a California law that allows people to bring alleged sexual assault cases even if the statute of limitations caused them to expire.\n\nIn a statement, Mangroe explained: \"What Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter. Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal. I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\"\n\nThrough a representative, Gesteelde-Diamant vehemently denied the claims. \"These claims are untrue and defamatory. I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals,\" he stated.\n\n\"As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\" The suit states that Mangroe turned to an Epic executive for help with the alleged abuse but was told \"she needed to figure out a way to work with Dream again.\"\n\nShe was dropped from the label in July 2016 and Epic is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The-Dream, who is an eight-time Grammy winner, has worked with Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber, Ciara and a slew of other artists.\n\nMangroe is being represented by Douglas H. Wigdor and Meredith A. Firetog, who also represented Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura in her November 2023 sexual assault and abuse lawsuit against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The-Dream", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The-Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariah_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariah Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ciara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventura County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/c3f60388ec82f3e5641fbf5b77877b8f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624443", "eventUri": "eng-9624443", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 1751, "textEnd": 1760}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\"\n\nMangroe accuses Gesteelde-Diamant of locking her in a dark room and \"violently having sex with her\" before leaving her \"alone, naked in the dark, for hours on end\"; forcing her to drink excessive amounts of alcohol by \"roughly\" pulling her head back by her hair and pouring it down her throat; choking her until she almost lost consciousness; refusing to wear a condom during sex and ejaculating inside of her against her wishes; raping her in the back of a van; and forcing her to engage in sex acts in a public movie theater.\n\nShe also alleges he recorded her during sex and used this recording to threaten her into silence.\n\nThe suit states that Mangroe was contacted by associates for Gesteelde-Diamant in 2014, when she was 23 years old and looking for her big break as a singer while working in the United States on an international visa from the Netherlands. After sending over samples of her work, Mangroe, also known as Channii Monroe, was invited to join Gesteelde-Diamant in Atlanta, according to the complaint.\n\nFrom there, the suit alleges that Gesteelde-Diamant made false promises to gain her trust, such as telling her he would sponsor her visa extension and write \"blockbuster\" songs for her, as well as claiming she would open for Beyonce\u0301 on tour. \"In reality, Dream used Ms. Mangroe for his base desires, which manifested in violent sexual acts and vicious psychological torture,\" the suit alleges.\n\nAdditionally, the complaint states that Gesteelde-Diamant \"controlled all aspects\" of Mangroe's stay in the U.S. and tracked her at all times, demanding she provide constant updates on her location. Gesteelde-Diamant's record label, Contra Paris LLC, and Epic Records are accused of facilitating his \"depraved behavior.\"\n\nMangroe's \"career was upended\" as a result of Gesteelde-Diamant's \"heinous acts,\" the lawsuit goes on to say, with her music allegedly being taken from her \"without any explanation.\" She says she has not recovered from the trauma and is still putting the pieces of her life back together almost 10 years later.\n\n\"Choosing to speak out about the trauma I survived has been one of the most difficult decisions of my life, but ultimately, what Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter,\" Mangroe said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. \"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal. I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\"\n\nAttorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and Meredith Firetog are representing Mangroe after working with Cassie Ventura, who sued Diddy for rape and sex trafficking last year in a lawsuit that has since been settled. In a statement, the attorneys compared Gesteelde-Diamant to Diddy.\n\n\"This is yet another horrific example of how men in the music industry use their power and influence to manipulate and harm others,\" Wigdor and Firetog said. \"Dream, like Sean Combs did with Ms. Ventura and others, used his standing as a prominent recording artist and producer to subject Ms. Mangroe to vicious physical, psychological, and sexual abuse.\"\n\nThey added, \"While she will never fully recover from what he and those who supported him did to her, her willingness to speak out now is evidence of her extraordinary strength. We are honored to represent her.\"\n\nGesteelde-Diamant has songwriting credits on hit tracks like Beyonc\u00e9's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and Rihanna's \"Umbrella.\" He has received eight Grammy awards and 21 nominations.\n\nRecording under The-Dream, his 2007 album \"Love/Hate\" spawned multiple singles, including \"Falsetto,\" \"Shawty Is A 10\" and \"I Luv Your Girl.\" He most recently produced songs on Beyonc\u00e9's \"Cowboy Carter\" and Usher's \"Coming Home,\" with a feature on the track \"Cold Blooded.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

On multiple occasions, Dream choked Ms. Mangroe so intensely that she almost lost consciousness,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nMangroe, now 33, claims in the complaint that the \"I Luv Your Girl\" singer, 46, allegedly refused to wear condoms during their sexual encounters and would often ejaculate inside her \"against her protests.\"\n\n\"When he discovered she was taking birth control, he became enraged because he believed it to be a sign of disrespect. She was forced to hide her birth control pills under a mattress,\" the lawsuit adds.\n\nThe-Dream allegedly raped Mangroe \"in the back of a renovated sprinter van, the same evening that he forced her to engage in sex acts in a public movie theater,\" per the lawsuit.\n\nShe also claims he recorded her during sexual acts and \"used the existence of the recording to threaten Ms. Mangroe into silence.\"\n\nMangroe included screenshots of alleged texts from The-Dream, in which he asked to \"undress\" her emotionally so he can \"know what's underneath your heart.\"\n\nHe also allegedly texted her that getting her to open for Beyonc\u00e9 isn't a \"big deal\" because the music star is \"family.\"\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, The-Dream denied the allegations.\n\n\"These claims are untrue and defamatory. I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals,\" he told the publication.\n\n\"As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\"\n\nMangroe told Page Six in a statement, \"Choosing to speak out about the trauma I survived has been one of the most difficult decisions of my life, but ultimately, what Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter.\n\n\"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal. I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\"\n\nMangroe's attorneys, Douglas H. Wigdor and Meredith Firetog, said in a statement to us that The-Dream's alleged actions are \"another horrific example of how men in the music industry use their power and influence to manipulate and harm others.\"\n\n\"Dream, like Sean Combs did with Ms. Ventura and others, used his standing as a prominent recording artist and producer to subject Ms. Mangroe to vicious physical, psychological, and sexual abuse,' the lawyers continued.\n\n\"While she will never fully recover from what he and those who supported him did to her, her willingness to speak out now is evidence of her extraordinary strength.

She alleges that Gesteelde-Diamant \"repeatedly forced her to have sex, strangled her and once made a video recording of an intimate encounter and threatened to show it to others\" after enticing her into a relationship with promises to help advance her career. Mangroe also names Epic Records in her complaint, saying they failed to respond to her reports against him, and eventually dropped her when he did not deliver her music to them.\n\nIn a statement, Mangroe said, \"What Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter. Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal. I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gesteelde-Diamant denied the allegations through a representative, responding, \"These claims are untrue and defamatory. I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals. As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\"\n\nAccording to the suit, Mangroe began a relationship with Gesteelde-Diamant after sending him samples of her work. He allegedly told her he could make her \"the next Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna,\" but began pressuring her for sex within days. She says that over time, he began having his security follow her, demanding regular check-ins and exploding with anger at perceived signs of disloyalty or ingratitude.\n\nMangroe is represented by Douglas H.

(Well-known hits include \"Umbrella\" and Beyonc\u00e9's \"Single Ladies.\") He has collaborated with Beyonc\u00e9 on six albums and once referred to as his \"musical soul mate\" by The New Yorker.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, associates of Gesteelde-Diamant reached out to Mangroe via social media in 2014, when she was 23 years old and working in the U.S. on a visa. The suit claims she sent him samples of her music and he promised her a recording contract with a major label if she came to Atlanta to work with him. He allegedly sweetened the pot by promising to sponsor her visa, write her blockbuster songs, and get her a gig opening for Beyonc\u00e9's next tour.\n\nBut there was a catch. According to the complaint, Gesteelde-Diamant lured Mangroe into a \"prolonged nightmare,\" in which he controlled her housing, transportation, and food expenses and kept near-constant track of her movements. He also allegedly forced her to drink excessive amounts of alcohol by holding her head back and pouring it down her throat.\n\nMost horrifically, the complaint alleges Gesteelde-Diamant raped Mangroe and forced into rough sex in which he choked her -- sometimes to edge of losing consciousness -- and verbally berated her, forcing her to \"praise him and declare her loyalty to him.\" He also allegedly refused to wear a condom and became enraged when he found out she was on birth control. She alleged he recorded their sexual acts and used the existence of these recordings to threaten her into silence.\n\nGesteelde-Diamant was previously arrested for allegedly punching and kicking his eight-months-pregnant girlfriend and threatening to kill her if she went to the police. Prosecutors dropped the charges after saying they could not prove them beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nHe was briefly engaged to singers Nivea and Christina Milian and has children with both.\n\nThe lawsuit follows similar allegations of physical and sexual abuse against another prominent producer, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. Seven women have sued Combs, accusing him of sex trafficking and sexual assault. He denies the allegations.\n\nMagroe's attorney, Douglas Wigdor, called Gesteelde-Diamant's alleged behavior \"yet another horrific example of how men in the music industry use their power and influence to manipulate and harm others.\"\n\n\"Dream, like Sean Combs did with Ms. Ventura and others, used his standing as a prominent recording artist and producer to subject Ms. Mangroe to vicious physical, psychological, and sexual abuse,\" Wigdor said in a statement. \"While she will never fully recover from what he and those who supported him did to her, her willingness to speak out now is evidence of her extraordinary strength.

The complaint names The-Dream, whose real name is Terius Adamu Ya Gesteelde-Diamant, as well as his label Contra Paris, LLC and Epic Records.\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, The-Dream denied the accusations. \"These claims are untrue and defamatory,\" he said. \"I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals. As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\"\n\nMangroe, now 33, claims that she was introduced to The-Dream in 2014 when she was 23, working in the United States on an international visa from the Netherlands. With aspirations of making it in the industry as a singer-songwriter, she states that associates of The-Dream reached out via social media and invited her to join his musical partner Tricky Stewart in Atlanta.\n\nAccording to the complaint, The-Dream made promises of writing blockbuster songs for her, an opening slot on Beyonc\u00e9's tour and sponsorship of an extension of her visa. From there, their relationship allegedly turned violent, as the suit goes into extensive detail about her allegations.\n\nMangroe says that The-Dream controlled all aspects of her life in the United States, tracking her location and texting her at all hours to check on her whereabouts. He allegedly forced her to drink copious amounts of alcohol, strangled her during violent sex to the point of losing consciousness, and refused to wear a condom during intercourse. To the latter accusation, Mangroe states that she was forced to hide her birth control pills from him.\n\nAmong the claims, Mangroe also shares that he berated her during sex, which he supposedly filmed and used as leverage against her, and once forcibly raped her on the same evening he coerced her to perform sexual acts in a public movie theater.\n\nEpic Records and Contra Paris are named in the lawsuit as The-Dream reportedly convinced them to fund Mangroe's career without intending to support it.\n\n\"Choosing to speak out about the trauma I survived has been one of the most difficult decisions of my life, but ultimately, what Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter,\" said Mangroe in a statement. \"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal. I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\"\n\n\"This is yet another horrific example of how men in the music industry use their power and influence to manipulate and harm others,\" says Mangroe's attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and Meredith Firetog, partners of Wigdor LLP, which also represented Cassie Ventura in her $30 million lawsuit against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs in November. \"Dream, like Sean Combs did with Ms. Ventura and others, used his standing as a prominent recording artist and producer to subject Ms. Mangroe to vicious physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. While she will never fully recover from what he and those who supported him did to her, her willingness to speak out now is evidence of her extraordinary strength. We are honored to represent her.\"\n\nMangroe is seeking compensatory damages connected to lost income from her experiences; a monetary judgment for her emotional distress; punitive and exemplary damages; and legal-related fees.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The-Dream", "type":

She alleges The-Dream, formally known as Terius Gesteelde-Diamant, coerced her into having sex with him repeatedly, strangled her, and threatened to show intimate recordings of them to others.\n\nThe 33-year-old aspiring singer says she met The-Dream in 2015 in Atlanta, where he allegedly dangled the promise of launching her career into superstardom. However, that dream quickly turned sour. Within days, Mangroe alleges The-Dream began pressuring her for sex, manipulating her by claiming it was necessary for her success. The lawsuit details disturbing incidents where he allegedly locked her in a dark room and forced himself on her, refused to use condoms despite her protests, and once put her up in an Atlanta hotel and instructed staff to monitor her movements. Additionally, the suit also describes an incident where he forced her to have sex with him in a theater in view of other moviegoers, which she described as \"a physically painful encounter.\"\n\n\"What Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter,\" Mangroe said in a statement. \"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal.

The woman, Chanaaz Mangroe (aka Channii Monroe), filed her lawsuit today (June 4) in a California federal court. The-Dream's record label, Contra Paris, and Epic Records are also named as defendants in the complaint.\n\nIn her complaint, viewed by Pitchfork, Mangroe says that she met The-Dream in 2014 when she was 23 years, coming to the United States from her native Netherlands and \"hoping to land her big break as a singer and a songwriter.\" The lawsuit states, \"Under the guise of pursuing a legitimate recording and publishing contract with Ms. Mangroe, Dream lured the young and vulnerable artist into an abusive, violent, and manipulative relationship filled with physical assaults, violent sexual encounters, and horrific psychological manipulation.\"\n\nThe lawsuit paints The-Dream, whose legal name is Terius Adamu Ya Gesteelde-Diamant, as a controlling figure who used his fame and connections with Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Jay-Z, and others to manipulate Mangroe. \"For a new artist, the thought of becoming the next Beyonce or Rihanna was obviously intoxicating,\" the lawsuit reads, \"and Ms. Mangroe was willing to work as hard as possible to make her recording dreams come true.\"\n\nMangroe claims that she went to Los Angeles in February 2015 to record her debut album. During their first night at the recording studio, The-Dream \"pressured her to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in excessive quantities,\" and also pressured her \"to have sex with him,\" she alleges. \"He assured her that sex with him was 'part of the process' and he could only write hit songs for her if she agreed to let him know everything about her,\" the lawsuit claims. The-Dream allegedly brought Mangroe to a bedroom and had sex with her; the producer left Mangroe in the bedroom and returned intermittently to continue having sex with her, the lawsuit claims.\n\n\"She returned to her hotel confused, but tried to remain grateful and hopeful for what she believed was her big break,\" according to the complaint. \"Throughout her time in Los Angeles, if Ms. Mangroe and Dream were in the studio at the same time, he expected her to be available to have sex with him whenever he demanded it.\"\n\nAfter the Los Angeles recording sessions, Mangroe flew home to Amsterdam, but quickly returned to the United States to move to The-Dream's Atlanta, Georgia, hometown, she says. \"Dream became increasingly controlling after Ms. Mangroe moved to Atlanta,\" she claims in the complaint. \"He told Ms. Mangroe that she needed to check in with him every day, she needed to be available to him whenever he called, and that she should depend only on him for anything she needed.\"", "source": {"uri": "pitchfork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pitchfork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@pitchfork.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author",

Blige, Justin Bieber, and Mariah Carey, among others. He's won eight Grammy Awards on 21 nominations, and most recently produced several songs on Cowboy Carter, including \"Levii's Jeans\" with Post Malone.\n\nA rep for Diamant did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but told the New York Times, \"These claims are untrue and defamatory. I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals. As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\"\n\n\"Choosing to speak out about the trauma I survived has been one of the most difficult decisions of my life, but ultimately, what Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter,\" Mangroe said in a statement. \"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal. I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\"\n\nMangroe's attorneys Douglas Wigdor and Meredith A. Firetog, who represented Cassie Ventura in her lawsuit against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, called the allegations \"yet another horrific example of how men in the music industry use their power and influence to manipulate and harm others.\"\n\n\"Dream, like Sean Combs did with Ms. Ventura and others, used his standing as a prominent recording artist and producer to subject Ms. Mangroe to vicious physical, psychological, and sexual abuse,\" Wigdor and Firetog said. \"While she will never fully recover from what he and those who supported him did to her, her willingness to speak out now is evidence of her extraordinary strength.

In the court documents obtained by The Blast, the plaintiff painted horrible details of the alleged abuse she suffered at his hands.\n\nThe-Dream, who has a long courtroom attendance ahead of him, is famous for writing music for renowned artists, with Beyonc\u00e9 being his longtime collaborator.\n\nAccording to the legal documents, Wigdor LLP, on behalf of their client Chanaaz Mangroe, filed a complaint against The-Dream, Contra Paris, LLC, and Epic Records.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, slammed the trio for gruesome crimes.\n\nThe defendants were accused of sex trafficking, while The-Dream was named for sexual battery and rape. Mangroe claimed she was trafficked under the guise of a legitimate recording and distribution contract.\n\nHowever, all she experienced was an \"abusive, violent, and manipulative relationship\" with The-Dream that was filled with \"physical assaults, violent sexual encounters, and horrific psychological manipulation.\"\n\nHer relationship with the alleged culprit began in 2014 when she worked in the United States on an international visa from the Netherlands.\n\nAt 23, she hoped to land her big break as a singer and songwriter and got the opportunity when associates of The-Dream reached out to her on social media.\n\nThe documents explained that Mangroe was thrilled when The-Dream's associates contacted her, and she sent samples of her work. Soon, she was invited to join the artist and his partner, Tricky Stewart, in Atlanta.\n\nUnfortunately, Mangroe claimed The-Dream lured her \"young and vulnerable\" self into a toxic relationship by abusing age and influence in the industry.\n\nHe allegedly manipulated her into believing that she needed him to be successful and roped her into his world through false promises to gain her complete trust.\n\nThese false promises included assuring Mangroe he would sponsor the extension of her international visa, telling her he would write blockbuster songs for her if she became part of his \"sanctuary,\" like he did for Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, and offering her \"lofty visions of recording and publishing contracts with major labels.\"\n\nAdditionally, The-Dream allegedly used his connection to Beyonc\u00e9 to sweeten his honeypot of lies by vowing Mangroe would open for Queen Bey's upcoming tour. He also forced her to diet and exercise excessively to prepare for the tour.\n\nMangroe noted that The-Dream did the exact opposite of his promises by using her as a tool to satisfy his desires, which manifested in violent sexual acts and vicious psychological torture.\n\nOne incident saw her locked in a dark room adjacent to a recording studio and being \"violently\" assaulted.\n\nThe-Dream allegedly left her naked in the dark following the assault, only to return hours later for another round, where he forced Mangroe to confess her love for him.\n\nThe singer-songwriter would frequently strangle her \"during violent sex, sometimes with his hands, and once using the collar of her dress.\"\n\nHe allegedly choked her so intensely that she almost lost consciousness on multiple occasions. The abuse didn't end there, as the lawsuit claimed The-Dream refused to wear a condom or allow Mangroe to use birth control pills.\n\nHe would also criticize her during intercourse, calling her ungrateful while insisting that she praise and declare her loyalty to him.\n\nOutside the forced sexual activities, The-Dream allegedly made Mangroe drink excessive amounts of alcohol by physically pulling her head back and pouring alcohol down her throat.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Mangroe stressed that she had no one to turn to as The-Dream controlled all aspects of her stay in the United States. This included where she lived, who she spoke to, what she ate, and where she went.\n\nThe songwriter threatened her into silence using the recordings of their sexual activities, which occurred without consent. He once raped her in the back of a Sprinter van on the same night he forced her to engage in sex acts in a public movie theater.\n\nMangroe noted that The-Dream's \"depraved behavior\" was facilitated by his record label, Contra Paris LLC, and Epic Records -- the label he convinced to invest in her but did nothing to protect her from him.\n\nThe-Dream's alleged abuse destroyed Mangroe's career, and the singer-songwriter and his supporters had ruined every attempt to revive it. She was also left with severe trauma and fear for her physical safety.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Her lawyers say he pinned her down inside a sprinter van, started \"forcibly having sex with her\" and choked her so intensely that she potentially lost consciousness.\n\nRepresentatives for The-Dream did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to five studio albums of his own, The-Dream has credits on a wide range of hits, including Rihanna's 2007 smash \"Umbrella\" and Beyonce's 2008 chart-topper \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\" He's also worked with Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, Kanye West and numerous other stars.\n\nMangroe, a native of the Netherlands, claims that The-Dream reached out to her in 2014 when she was just 23 years old and working in the United States on an international visa. After she sent samples of her work, she says he invited her to Atlanta to work with him and his producing partner, Tricky Stewart.\n\nOver time, her lawyers say The-Dream \"used his age and influence in the industry to manipulate the young artist into believing that she needed him to be successful.\" They say he promised to help her secure a visa extension, sign a record deal with a major label and even offered her a chance to open for Beyonce's upcoming tour.\n\nBut in reality, her lawyers say The-Dream \"used Ms. Mangroe for his base desires, which manifested in violent sexual acts and vicious psychological torture.\" In addition to the alleged rape, they say he frequently subjected her to violent choking during sex, \"berated\" her during sex and used recordings of their sex to \"threaten Ms. Mangroe into silence.\"\n\n\"Nearly a decade later, Ms. Mangroe is still putting the pieces of her life back together, but she knows that without speaking up about what Dream did to her, she will never be able to heal from the harm he has caused,\" her lawyers write. \"She therefore brings this lawsuit to speak up for herself and other female artists who have been tormented by powerful and selfish men in the recording industry.\n\nIn addition to The-Dream, the lawsuit also names Sony Music's Epic Records as a defendant, arguing that the producer's \"depraved behavior\" was facilitated by the company. The lawsuit claims Epic \"benefited from facilitating his behavior to the extent it kept their relationship with the talented musician viable and ensured continued profit from his work.\"\n\nReps for both Epic and parent company Sony Music did not immediately return requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by Douglas Wigdor, a New York attorney known for representing alleged sexual assault victims. Wigdor's firm has filed numerous abuse cases against music industry figures in recent months, including the bombshell case against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs filed by his ex-partner Cassie.", "source":

She also alleged that he plied her with drugs and alcohol before forcing her to have sex, which he then filmed and threatened to release. She also alleges that he kept a gun close by during sexual encounters.\n\nIn a statement, Gesteelde-Diamant responded: \"These claims are untrue and defamatory. I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals. As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations.\"\n\nOn one occasion at a cinema, she claims he demanded oral sex in front of patrons. After she refused, he forced her into \"physically painful\" sex before later assaulting her again in his van while pinning her down and making it hard for her to breathe.\n\n\"What Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter,\" Mangroe said in a statement. \"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realised that I need to tell my story to heal.\n\n\"I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\"\n\nMangroe claims that Gesteelde-Diamant falsely promised her that her career would progress, boasting that he could make her the opening act for Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nHe signed her to his record label Contra Paris with a distribution deal arranged with Sony-owned Epic Records.\n\nShe says she reported his abuse to an Epic executive in 2015 - and she claims she was told \"she needed to figure out a way to work with Dream again\".\n\nIn 2013, Gesteelde-Diamant was arrested on allegations of domestic violence, but his girlfriend chose not to press charges. The year after, the same partner - who was then pregnant - accused him of assault, strangulation, reckless endangerment and child endangerment. But prosecutors later dropped the case against him.\n\nGesteelde-Diamant has had a long working relationship with Beyonc\u00e9, co-writing songs including Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) and Partition. Other hits he has been involved in include Rihanna's Umbrella and Mariah Carey's Touch My Body.\n\nMangroe filed the suit against Gesteelde-Diamant in Los Angeles. Her lawyers also represent the singer Cassie, who filed a lawsuit against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs for allegations of abuse that the rapper and producer quickly settled.\n\nCNN in May obtained and broadcast a surveillance video which showed Combs manhandling and kicking Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. Combs later said he was \"truly sorry\" for beating Cassie.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The-Dream", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The-Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stage name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partition (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umbrella (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_My_Body", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touch My Body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Ladies_(Put_a_Ring_on_It)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariah_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariah Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_guardian_765/7970e6b4753149c1f6e0928d7dff1e88", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624443", "eventUri": "eng-9624443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Ms. Mangroe's suit cites the Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, a California law that allows people to bring sexual assault cases even if the statute of limitations for incidents they allege have expired.\n\n\"What Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter,\" Ms. Mangroe said in a statement. \"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal.

Chanaaz Mangroe, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Dream's who performed as Channii Monroe, claims he used promises about her career to pressure her into an abusive relationship back in 2015. In the lawsuit, she recalls him allegedly forcing her to have sex, strangling her and even making a video recording of one of their sexual encounters and threatening to publicize it. She also makes accusations of sex trafficking.\n\n\"What Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter,\" Mangroe said in a statement to The New York Times. \"Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal. I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse.\" She filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.\n\nRead More: The-Dream Celebrates Working On Beyonce\u0301's \"Break My Soul\"\n\nWhile the statute of limitations on the alleged crimes has passed, Mangroe is citing California's Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, which provides victims more time to bring sexual assault cases in civil court. Dream has yet to comment on the lawsuit publically.\n\nDream's credits include Rihanna's \"Umbrella,\" Kanye West & JAY-Z's \"No Church in the Wild,\" Beyonce's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),\" and many more hits. For his efforts, he's secured eight Grammy Awards on 21 nominations. Those included Songwriter of the Year at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.
